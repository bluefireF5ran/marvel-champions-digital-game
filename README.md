## Overview & Philosophy

Marvel Champions is a cooperative Living Card Game (LCG) featuring intricate turn structures (Hero Phase ⟷ Villain Phase), simultaneous timing windows ("When", "Interrupt", "Response"), card-driven ability stacks, status effects, and dozens of interacting keywords.

This project is built **rules-engine-first**:

- **Deterministic State Machine**: Game state is completely serializable, reproducible, and decoupled from any presentation or I/O layer.
- **RRG as Authority**: Follows the official Fantasy Flight Games _Rules Reference Guide_ (RRG 1.5–1.8), official FAQ rulings, and errata.
- **Headless Rules Engine**: The engine runs independently with zero DOM or rendering dependencies, capable of simulating and auditing full games headlessly.
- **Phaser as a Pure View**: The client UI is purely a presentation layer that dispatches player commands and reflects state; it never decides game rules or move legality.

## Repository Architecture

This monorepo is organized with **pnpm workspaces** under `packages/`. The dependency graph enforces strict directional boundaries: `client → cards → engine → content`.

### Package Details

| Package                               | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[`@mc/content`](packages/content)** | Contains typed card schemas (`AnyCard`, `ScalingValue`, `KeywordInstance`, `AbilityReference`), normalized card data, and ingestion scripts (`ingest-marvelcdb.ts`) that curate card text and stats from MarvelCDB / Cerebro. Stores artwork references rather than raw image bytes.                            |
| **[`@mc/engine`](packages/engine)**   | The authoritative rules engine. Implements game state (`GameState`), phase loops, interrupt/response timing stacks, keyword resolution (Guard, Overkill, Retaliate, Surge, Toughness, etc.), villain AI phase handling, legal action generation (`legalActions`), and replayable command logs (`applyCommand`). |
| **[`@mc/cards`](packages/cards)**     | Houses the Ability DSL for scripting card behaviors into engine `AbilityDefinition`s. Implements all 233 Core Set card abilities across 5 heroes (Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, She-Hulk, Iron Man, Black Panther), 4 aspects, basic cards, and 3 villain scenarios (Rhino, Klaw, Ultron).                        |
| **[`@mc/client`](packages/client)**   | A 2D tabletop client inspired by digital card games like _Sentinels of the Multiverse_. Built with **Phaser 4**, **rexUI**, and **Vite**. Runs the engine inside a Web Worker via `EngineHost` for fluid 60 FPS rendering while calculating complex turn states.                                                |

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (Strict mode across all packages)
- **Monorepo & Package Manager**: pnpm workspaces (Node.js >= 22)
- **Rules Simulation & Ability DSL**: Pure TypeScript headless state machine
- **Frontend / Client**: Phaser 4 (`phaser` ^4.2.1) + rexUI (`phaser4-rex-plugins`) + Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest (colocated `*.test.ts` suites across all packages)
- **Toolchain / Task Runner**: Mise (optional, delegates to `pnpm` scripts)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 22.0.0)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (>= 11.24.0)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/quincarter/marvel-champions-game.git
cd marvel-champions-game

# Install workspace dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Running the Client

Start the Vite development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
pnpm --filter @mc/client dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to play.

### Running Tests & Typechecks

```bash
# Run all unit and scenario test suites across all packages
pnpm test

# Typecheck all packages
pnpm typecheck
```

### Guided-mode end-to-end tests

`packages/client/e2e/` is a small [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) suite that drives the guided tutorial
through a real browser (New Game → the five lessons → Tutorial complete, plus "never locked in" — Skip/Escape/Stop
tutorial — and the Hold on!/tips fixtures) against the client's own Vite dev server, so the guided flow can't
silently break. It's separate from `pnpm test`/`pnpm check` because it's slower and needs a real browser:

```bash
# Install Chromium once
pnpm --filter @mc/client exec playwright install --with-deps chromium

# Run the suite (starts its own dev server on a fixed port)
pnpm e2e
# or
pnpm --filter @mc/client e2e
```

It does not run in CI. It is required before pushing: the pre-push hook (`.githooks/pre-push`, installed by
`pnpm install`) runs the suite on what you are about to push whenever the push changes `packages/` or
`pnpm-lock.yaml`, and remembers a pass, so the same code is not tested twice. `pnpm e2e:verify` runs the same gate
ahead of time. Pull requests run lint and format (`.github/workflows/checks.yml`) and the Netlify workflow, which typechecks,
runs the unit tests, builds the client and deploys the preview; `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` can still be started by hand.

### Releases & Cross-Platform Packaging

Automated cross-platform releases are published via GitHub Actions whenever changes are merged into `main`:

- **Desktop (Tauri)**: macOS, one build each for Apple silicon (`aarch64`) and Intel (`x64`) (`.dmg`, `.app.tar.gz`), Linux (`.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`), Windows 11 (`.msi`, `-setup.exe`).
- **Mobile (Capacitor)**: Android release APK (`.apk`).
- **Asset names** spell out the OS, architecture and kind of installer, so the right download is easy to pick from the release page: `MarvelChampions-<version>-Windows-x64-Setup.exe` (per user, no admin rights) and `-Windows-x64-AllUsers.msi` (every user, Program Files); `-macOS-AppleSilicon-arm64.dmg` and `-macOS-Intel-x64.dmg` (plus their `.app.tar.gz`); `-Linux-x64.deb`, `.rpm` and `.AppImage`; `-Android.apk`. `scripts/lib/release-collector.mjs` names them for both the release workflow (`scripts/stage-release-assets.mjs`) and local builds, and every release's notes end with a "Which download do I need?" table (`.github/release-downloads.md`).
- **macOS signing**: the `.dmg` is signed and notarized only when these repository secrets are set: `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` (Developer ID Application `.p12`, base64-encoded), `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` (e.g. `Developer ID Application: Name (TEAMID)`), and for notarization `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD` (an app-specific password) and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`. Without them the app is unsigned and macOS blocks it on first launch: allow it in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway, or run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Marvel Champions.app"`.
- **Update notice**: the desktop and Android apps are not in an app store, so on launch they ask GitHub's public API for this repo's latest published release (`packages/client/src/platform/update-check.ts`). When it is newer than the running build and carries an installer for that platform, the Title screen shows an "Update available" banner with two buttons: "What's new" opens the release page (the changelog and every download) and "Download" opens the installer that install came from (the `.apk`; the `-setup.exe` or `.msi`; the `.dmg` for its architecture; the `.AppImage`, `.deb` or `.rpm`). When the app can't tell which installer it came from, the banner has the release page alone. A release is only "latest" once the workflow's last job publishes it, after every installer has been uploaded. The web app never asks.
- **Changelog & Versioning**: Managed via [Changie](https://github.com/miniscruff/changie). Use `changie new` to record changes during development.
- **Local Release Pipeline**: `mise ship-it` (or `pnpm ship-it`) builds and stages all native packages locally.

### Card Data Ingestion

To re-ingest and normalize card data from MarvelCDB:

```bash
# Ingest Core Set card data from MarvelCDB
pnpm ingest

# Re-normalize using committed offline cache
pnpm --filter @mc/content ingest -- --pack core --offline
```
