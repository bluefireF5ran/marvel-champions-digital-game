## Overview & philosophy

Marvel Champions is a cooperative Living Card Game (LCG) with an intricate turn structure (Hero Phase ⟷ Villain
Phase), timing windows ("When", "Interrupt", "Response"), card-driven ability stacks, status effects, and dozens of
interacting keywords.

This project is built **rules-engine-first**:

- **Deterministic state machine**: game state is serializable, reproducible from a seed and a command log, and
  decoupled from any presentation or I/O layer.
- **The Rules Reference is the authority**: the official _Rules Reference Guide_ (v1.8, in this repo), FFG's errata and
  its rulings decide how the game behaves.
- **Headless rules engine**: the engine has no DOM or rendering dependencies and can simulate and audit full games on
  its own.
- **Phaser as a pure view**: the client presents state and sends player commands; it never decides rules or move
  legality.

## Tech stack

- **Language**: TypeScript, strict mode in every package
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces (Node.js >= 22)
- **Client**: Phaser 4 + rexUI (`phaser4-rex-plugins`) + Vite; Tauri 2 (desktop) and Capacitor (Android)
- **Testing**: Vitest unit and scenario suites, Playwright end-to-end suite
- **Lint and format**: oxlint and oxfmt
- **Changelog**: Changie

How the packages fit together, and how to run the game locally, is in [Architecture](docs/project/architecture.md).

## Community

- **Bugs, feature ideas and deck requests:** open an issue from the
  [issue chooser](https://github.com/quincarter/marvel-champions-digital-game/issues/new/choose). In the game, the bug
  icon in the top bar (or on the Title screen) opens Report an issue, which copies the game log for your report.
- **Rules questions:** check the [Rules Reference](mc_rulesreference_v18_compressed.pdf) and
  [FFG's rulings](https://hallofheroeslcg.com/latest-ffg-rulings-post-rrg-1-7/) before filing a rules bug.
- **Discord:** _coming soon._ <!-- TODO: replace this line with the Discord invite link once the server exists. -->
- **Contributing:** see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, tests, conventions and the release flow.

Next up:

- **Fear No Evil (cycle 11)**: its card data is in; scripting, its six-scenario campaign and its heroes come next.
- **Civil War leftovers**: the Synthezoid Smackdown scenario pack and competitive (team versus team) mode, which the
  game marks as coming soon.
- **Hero AI** to fill seats with computer-controlled heroes, then **online multiplayer** (Phase 5).

What you can play today is in [Current status](docs/project/current-status.md). The detailed plan, decisions and per-wave specs are in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) and [`docs/`](docs).
