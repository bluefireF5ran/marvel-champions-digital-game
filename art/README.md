# art/

Full-bleed pictures the client shows outside of card scans. Every folder here
is globbed at build time, so **adding a file is all it takes** — there is no
list to edit. Formats: `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `avif`.

| `campaigns/<campaignId>/`     | `rulebook/page_NNN.jpg`               | The box's official, lettered rulebook comic pages (see its `SOURCE.md`); a one-off scenario's own intro reuses one (`scenario-intros.ts`), for `trors`/`gmw`/`mts`/`sm`/`mut_gen`/`next_evol`/`aoa`/`aos` only — see below |

`<scenarioId>` is the content package's `Scenario.id`, so the folder name is the
lookup: `rhino`, `klaw`, `ultron`, `risky-business`, `mutagen-formula`,
`breakout` (the Wrecking Crew's scenario), `crossbones`, `absorbing-man`, `taskmaster`, `zola`, `red-skull`, `kang`,
`brotherhood-of-badoon`, `infiltrate-the-museum`, `escape-the-museum`, `nebula` and `ronan-the-accuser`. A folder
with just a `.gitkeep` is a scenario still waiting for its pictures. `<packCode>` is `Pack.code`
(`POOL_PACKS` in `packages/client/src/content/pool.ts`, e.g. `core`, `twc`) the
same way — no pack ships a cover yet, and a shelf header draws fine without
one (just the pack's name and a rule, no thumbnail).

`<campaignId>` is the content package's `Campaign.id`, which is the campaign box's pack code, the same key
`music/campaigns/` uses: `trors` (The Rise of Red Skull), `gmw` (The Galaxy's Most Wanted), `mts` (The Mad
Titan's Shadow), `sm` (Sinister Motives), `mut_gen` (Mutant Genesis), `next_evol` (NeXt Evolution), `aoa` (Age of
Apocalypse), `aos` (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), `fne` (Fear No Evil) and `shadowland` (Shadowland: a cover, five panels as artboards and six lettered pages of Marvel's 2010 event as the Aftermath's read; see its `SOURCE.md`). Civil War has no campaign mode, so no folder.
All eleven folders exist; one with just a `.gitkeep` is still waiting for its cover or panels. A cover shows on the
Saga tile and the Cover screen. An artboard shows wherever a panel in `packages/client/src/campaign/stories/<campaignId>.ts` names it
(`mountain-facility` → `artboards/mountain-facility.webp`); until the file exists the panel keeps its "Panel art: …"
note. `packages/client/src/art/campaign-art.test.ts` fails if an artboard file matches no name a story uses.

**Two kinds of campaign story art.** `artboards/` holds single pictures, one per story panel (The Rise of Red Skull
works this way). `pages/` holds whole comic pages with several panels each, and a box that has a `pages/` folder is
told through the comic reader instead (`artifacts/design-screenshots/individual/gmw-comic-reader.dc/`). Name pages
`NN-<slug>.<ext>` (`01-badoon.jpg`, `02-museum.jpg`, …): the two-digit number is the page order, the slug is for
people. Where each panel sits on a page, and which story beats it carries, is recorded once in the box's story file,
because a file name can't hold it. Credit the artist in a `CREDITS.md` beside the pages when the art is fan-made
(see `campaigns/gmw/pages/`).

**Official rulebook pages vs. the pages the reader uses.** `rulebook/` holds each box's official comic pages as they
are printed in its rulebook, captions and speech balloons included, rendered by the `extract-artboards` skill and
named by rulebook page number (`page_006.jpg`). `pages/` and `artboards/` hold what the campaign reader shows:
unlettered pages the comic reader letters itself, and single pictures. Keep them apart: a lettered page in `pages/`
would show its printed balloons under the reader's own. For The Galaxy's Most Wanted, the Joey Vazquez pages in
`pages/` turned out to be the unlettered art of the same six pages its rulebook prints. The Rise of Red Skull's own
`pages/` are the one exception: its rulebook comic _is_ the campaign's story, so its 8 pages are copied
byte-for-byte from `rulebook/` into `pages/` and marked `lettered: true` (`campaign/stories/trors.ts`) rather than
teach the campaign reader a second "official pages load a different way" branch. MojoMania's insert has no comic, so its `pages/` hold two lettered pages the owner supplied (the broadcast spread that
opens issue #1 and the X-Babies page that closes the campaign), also marked `lettered: true`; its panel rectangles
are measured from the gutters in each file (`campaign/stories/mojo.ts`). Issues #2 and #3 open on clean single
pictures in `artboards/` (`empty-set`, `spiral`, `screens`, `mojo-looms`, `longshot`; `hallway` is still to come, 1672x941).
A story page marked `artboard: true` reads its picture from there, unlettered, so the reader letters it: each beat
is the reading area's own shape (2.04:1 wide, 0.574:1 phone) and each line's `placement` is measured on the file.

A one-off (non-campaign) game's own scenario intro is different again: it shows the box's `rulebook/` page directly,
un-copied — the page right before that scenario's own Setup instructions begin, already lettered around that
scenario's own villain reveal (`campaign/scenario-intros.ts`, docs/phase7-wave5-handoff.md "Scenario intros from the
rulebook art"). Only the boxes with scenario content in this build's pool read `rulebook/` at all
(`packages/client/src/art/campaign-art.ts`'s `RULEBOOK_CAMPAIGN_IDS`: `trors`, `gmw`, `mts`, `sm`, `mut_gen`, `next_evol`, `aoa` today) — globbing
every box's `rulebook/` would ship ~43 MB of pages no screen shows yet. A box outside that list, or a scenario whose
own page wasn't captured (GMW's Ronan the Accuser: page 17 fell outside what got rendered), simply has no
rulebook-page intro and falls back to whatever it already had (its own `art/scenarios/<id>/intro.*`, or none).

`<identityId>` is the hero identity card's id (`01001a` Spider-Man, `51001a` Shuri's Black Panther). Only the part
of the folder name before the first `-` is read; the rest is there so a person can tell the folders apart. Card ids
are used because nothing shorter is unique — two heroes are called Black Panther, two Spider-Man, and one pack can
hold five heroes. An empty folder (just a `.gitkeep`) is a hero still waiting for a picture: drop `hero.<ext>` in.
`heroes/_pending/` holds pictures for heroes whose pack isn't imported yet; it is never read. Each such hero has
its future folder waiting there (`_pending/40037a-domino/`, holding a `.gitkeep` until it gets a `hero.<ext>`), because
a folder directly under `heroes/` for a hero with no card data fails the test below. When a pack is imported as card
data, the same branch moves its heroes' folders up one level into `heroes/`, pictures and all.
`packages/client/src/art/hero-art.test.ts` fails if a folder isn't a real identity id or a file isn't `hero*`.

**Keeping the hero in frame (`focus.json`).** A tile or card crops a picture to its own shape, around the middle by
default, which cuts off a hero who stands off to one side in a landscape or square picture (Daredevil's is 700x500
with his face at x 0.38). Put an optional `focus.json` in the hero's folder, `{ "x": 0.38, "y": 0.3 }`: where the
subject is in the picture, 0 left/top to 1 right/bottom. Every crop of that hero's art (campaign roster, Take your
seats tiles and deck sheet, deck rows, seat avatars, dossier, briefing, finale) centers on that point, kept inside the
picture. Either axis may be left out; an axis left out crops the way the screen always did. It applies to every
picture in the folder (`hero.jpg`, `hero-2.png`), and a folder with no `focus.json` crops around the center.
Estimate the point off the face or the middle of the figure; the check is the roster's tall seat tile.

**Extras** (the Title menu's reward shelf) shows these same pictures once play has opened them: a hero's
`hero.*` files, a scenario's `villain*` files, `title/`, `outcomes/` and each campaign's `cover.*`. Nothing extra
needs adding for it; a new file shows up there too. `extras/`: pictures shown only on the Extras ▸ Artwork shelf, always open; name the file for its title.

**Several pictures for one slot:** add a suffix — `villain.jpg`,
`villain-2.jpg`, `villain-3.png` — and one is picked at random.

A concession shows `outcomes/defeat`, never a `villain-wins` scene: the team
stopped, the villain didn't beat them.

Game Over shows the scene on every layout: edge to edge in the art window at
the top on phone and tablet-portrait, and as a full-bleed backdrop under a wash
of the result's color (red for a loss, green for a win) on desktop.

`scenarios/_pending/` holds villain art for scenarios that aren't in the pool yet; like `heroes/_pending/`, it
is never read.

`packages/client/src/art/scenario-art.test.ts` fails if a file here fits no slot
(a typo like `villian.jpg`) or a scenario folder isn't a real scenario id.

Keep pictures at or under about **4096 px** on the long side. A texture larger
than the GPU's limit fails to upload — commonly 4096 on phones — and a picture
decodes to `width × height × 4` bytes whatever its size on disk.
