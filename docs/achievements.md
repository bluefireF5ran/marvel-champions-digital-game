# Achievements, ranks and the Title trophy shelf (draft)

_Owner request, 2026-10-20 (PR #251, client step). Draft for the client step to build; names are placeholders the owner
can swap._

Like [`progression.md`](progression.md), this is a feature of this client, not of Marvel Champions: it never changes
how a game plays, and the rules engine never sees it.

## What exists today

Champion points (`progression.md`, "Champion points") are already a derived score: firsts only (a scenario's first
win, its first Expert win, a campaign, an Expert campaign), never stored, read from the `won` rows in `mc-saves` and
`mc-campaigns`. Points can be spent to unlock content by hand.

## What this adds

1. **Achievements.** A long, attainable list, each one derived from the save history the way champion points are
   (nothing to farm, nothing stored but the game records themselves). Each has a name (often cheeky), a description, a
   progress bar where it counts something, and a points value that feeds the same champion points total.
2. **Rank.** A title earned from the **lifetime** points total (points earned, not the balance left after spending on
   unlocks), shown on the Title screen and in the Trophy Room.
3. **Trophy shelf on the Title.** The rank, the points and a bar to the next rank in a corner badge; earned Extras art
   joins the Title's picture rotation; a rank-up plays a short fanfare the next time the Title shows.
4. **Trophy Room.** One screen off the Title (and Extras) listing every achievement, earned and locked; a locked one
   says how to earn it. Grouped by: wins, boxes and campaigns, heroes, Expert, feats, and the funny ones.

## Ranks (placeholders)

| Rank | Title                   |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| 1    | Sidekick in Training    |
| 2    | Neighborhood Watch      |
| 3    | Costumed Vigilante      |
| 4    | Street-Level Legend     |
| 5    | Avengers Reserve        |
| 6    | Team Leader             |
| 7    | Living Legend           |
| 8    | Cosmic Powerhouse       |
| 9    | Ultimate Champion (all) |

Thresholds are set so the last rank needs every achievement and every scenario and campaign first; the others are
spread so a new player ranks up within the first few sessions.

## Achievement families (starter list)

- **Battles won (tiered):** 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 wins.
- **Villains:** beat each villain once; beat every villain of a box; beat every villain in the pool.
- **Boxes and campaigns:** complete each campaign; each on Expert; complete every campaign.
- **Heroes:** win with each hero; win with every hero of a box; win with 10 / 25 / all heroes; win with each aspect.
- **Expert and Heroic:** first Expert win; Expert wins against every villain of a box; a Heroic win.
- **Feats:** win with a hero at exactly 1 hit point; win in round 1 or 2; win solo against a box's finale; win a
  four-player game; win with no allies played.
- **The funny ones (losses count too):** lose 10 / 50 / 100 games ("Glutton for Punishment", "Professional Punching
  Bag", "Thanos Sends His Regards"); have heroes defeated 25 / 100 times ("Respawn Pending"); lose to the main scheme
  completing 10 times ("Read the Room"); lose on round 1 ("Speedrun (Wrong Direction)"); win with Hulk at 1 HP
  ("Gamma-Ray Overdose").

- **Team-up stories (earned mini comics):** win with a specific pair seated together to unlock a short story extra.
  First: Thor and She-Hulk together unlocks "Worthy of a Second Date?" (owner, 2026-10-20), the misadventure from Jason
  Aaron's _Avengers_ #11 (2018). The extra is a four-page excerpt (`art/side-stories/thor-she-hulk-badlands-date/`) shown
  with a bibliography (title, issue, year, creators, publisher, link) (owner, 2026-10-20). They are read on their own
  Extras tab, Side Stories, apart from the campaign issues, in the comic reader: panel by panel so the printed
  lettering is readable, each page ending on the whole page (owner, 2026-10-22). A new one is a row in
  `content/side-stories.ts` (its pages and their panel rectangles) and a folder of pages.

- **Earned items already built:** PR #294 (Ultron Drone art, stacked on this branch) adds an earned item, "Drone art",
  toggled under Settings > More > Earned items and for now gated on "win a game against Ultron" read from the save
  history. When the achievements list is built, add a Drone achievement for that win and point the item's unlock in `progression/earned-items.ts` (setting `ultronDroneArt`) at it in place of `scenarioWon ultron` (owner, 2026-10-20). `EARNED_ITEMS` (each with an `ExtrasUnlock` read through `Extras.isOpen`; `earnedItems()` / `applyEarnedItems()` in `progression/progression.ts`; Settings > More "Earned items" via `earnedItemRowInfoOf`) is meant to hold every cosmetic reward, so the funny joke packs and other achievement rewards become earned items too, likely through an achievement kind of `ExtrasUnlock`.

## Unlock popup

Built 2026-10-20 (owner's request): an Xbox-style "Achievement unlocked" popup (`scenes/achievement-toast.ts`, model in
`view/achievement-toast.ts`). A gold trophy badge with the MC monogram pops in, a bar opens out of it with the name and
what it earned, holds, and folds away, with `audio/sfx/achievement-unlocked.mp3` (Universfield's "Level Complete").
Two or more achievements at once stack into one popup ("5 achievements unlocked", their points summed); a tap (or
click) opens it into a list of them all, with Collapse (back to the popup, which then holds its full time again) and
Dismiss; the list grows out of the popup and shrinks back into it, keeps one size and sits in the middle whatever the popup's own settings; Escape or a tap outside the list collapses it, and every screen under it holds its input while it is open.
What opens in Extras uses the same popup on its own beat after the achievements' ("New song earned", or "5 extras in
the vault" stacked), with the Extras sting; it replaced the music button's "New song earned" notice (owner,
2026-10-20). It checks once a second against what the last `refreshUnlocks()` read (`earnedAchievementIds()`), remembers what it
announced in `mc-achievements-seen` (`platform/achievements-seen.ts`; a first run records silently), queues several,
and folds more than four at once into one summary. It takes no input.

Settings ▸ More ▸ Achievements: **Achievement popup** (Off, 3, 5, 8 or 10 s; default 5 s) and **Popup position**
(Title bar, Top, Middle, Bottom; default Title bar), and **Popup size** (Small, Medium, Large; default Small; owner,
2026-10-20). Picking any of them shows a sample.

**How to Play (owner, 2026-10-20):** "Studying Like Doctor Strange" (`feat-how-to-play`, 50 points, with a progress
bar) for finishing every How to Play row: the five basics lessons and each aspect's Try it
(`view/how-to-play-model.ts#howToPlayProgressOf`, read from the guide prefs into `AchievementHistory.howToPlay`). The
popup re-reads achievements whenever the guide prefs change, since a lesson finished changes no save.

**Hero lines and Unlock everything (owner, 2026-10-20):** each hero has a "played" achievement (`played-<identity>`,
10 points) for finishing a game as them, win or lose, named for their line in `progression/hero-quotes.ts` (the owner
chose Captain America's "I can do this all day", Thor's "Another!", Iron Man's "I am Iron Man", She-Hulk's "I object"
and T'Challa's "Wakanda Forever!"; the rest were drafted for the owner to edit). "Sometimes You Gotta Run Before You Can
Walk" (`unlock-everything`, funny family, a joke pack) is earned by turning on Settings ▸ Unlocks' "Unlock everything",
remembered in `mc-unlocked-everything` after it is turned off again.

**I Love You 3000 (owner, 2026-10-20):** `iron-man-thanos`, 100 points, for winning against Thanos with Iron Man's seat
dealing the last damage. The save row's summary now records `finalBlowBy` (the identity of the seat whose card dealt the
villain its last damage, from the game record's last blow); games saved before it don't count.

## Data the client must record

Most families read the existing `mc-saves` / `mc-campaigns` rows (outcome, scenario, heroes, difficulty, players,
round). A finished game's save row also carries a `summary` (`engine/game-summary.ts`, written by `session-core.ts`):
the loss reason (players defeated, scheme completed, conceded), heroes defeated, each winner's identity and hit points
(and whether in hero form), and allies played. Saves from before it simply don't count toward those achievements.

## Decided

- **Points (owner, 2026-10-20: A).** Achievement points add to the same champion points total that unlocks spend; rank
  reads lifetime points. Exception: the funny "for trying" achievements (losses, heroes defeated, round-1 losses) give
  no champion points. Each unlocks a silly content pack instead, such as a joke Extras picture, a card-back or
  board skin, a funny title or banner line, or a sound sting, so losing still earns something to laugh at.

## Open for the owner

- The names: every title above is a placeholder, and so are the funny packs' contents.
