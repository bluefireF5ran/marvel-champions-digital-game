# Campaign mode: the one-time foundation

Design for PLAN.md "Campaign mode (decided 2026-09-20)" §C1. The decisions in that section are settled and are not
re-litigated here.

**The requirement this document is answerable to:** adding a new campaign box, or a new campaign card, later must be
**content-only work** — a module in `@mc/cards` plus data in `@mc/content`, with no change to engine types and no
change to the client. Everything below is shaped by surveying all ten rulebooks _first_, so the foundation is not
secretly shaped like The Rise of Red Skull (MC10), which is merely the first box we build.

Sources: the ten rulebook conversions in `docs/campaign-modes/markdown/` (primary, cited as box code + page), RRG 1.8
`docs/rules/mc_rulesreference_v18_compressed.pdf` pp. 11, 29, and `docs/rulings/marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md` (cited by date).

## 1. Mechanism inventory

One row per distinct thing a campaign does. "Boxes" lists every box that uses the mechanism; the citation is the
clearest printed statement of it (usually the first box that prints it).

| #   | Mechanism                                                                                                        | Boxes                                   | Citation               |

### 1.1 What MC10 does _not_ exercise

MC10 uses rows 1, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 30, 32, 35–38, 47, 51–53, 56, 57. Everything else is
**unproven by the first build**. The ones that would force an engine or client change if the foundation ignored them:

- **Non-linear scenario graphs and scenario progression/failure** (rows 2–4, 14) — MC60.
- **A campaign currency with purchase and group-wide uniqueness** (rows 25–26) — MC16.
- **A track whose nodes append setup instructions to later scenarios** (row 42) — MC27. The only box where the
  _instruction list itself is log-derived_.
- **Hidden campaign state and a deduction grid** (rows 44–45) — MC50.
- **A card's counters and face persisting across scenarios** (row 46) — MC50.
- **Prohibited-card lists and a deck-customization freeze inside a campaign** (rows 54–55) — MC16, MC27, MC40.
- **Non-trivial defeat blocks, including standard mode** (rows 12–13, 19) — MC50, MC60.
- **Winning the last scenario and losing the campaign** (row 16) — MC45.
- **Random selection from an "available until struck" pool** (row 40) — MC45, MC40.
- **Per-game non-permanent grants and "use it or lose it"** (rows 29, 33) — MC32.
- **Between-games choices that search the player's whole collection** (row 28) — MC27, MC32, MC45.
- **Setup windows other than "after scenario setup"** (rows 7–9) — MC50, MC60.

Each of these is why the corresponding shape below (`kind: "choice"` graphs, `CampaignOp`, `CampaignWindow`,
`LossPolicy`, `hidden`, seeded campaign RNG, `DeckContext`) is in the foundation even though MC10 never touches it.

### 1.2 Things that did not fit a category — the design risks

- **MC56 Civil War has no campaign mode at all.** MC56 p. 3: "_the Civil War expansion does not include five
  interconnected scenarios and a campaign mode_." It is a custom-scenario + competitive (PvP) expansion. PLAN.md §C3
  lists it as a campaign box with "2 scenarios"; that row is wrong. See Open question Q2.
- **MC45's "Defeated" instructions are the rewards, and "Not Defeated" the penalties.** MC45 p. 24 (corrected: this
  entry once read the sheet backward): defeating Evacuate Survivors, Sabotage the Sea Wall or Find Lost Mutants lets
  each player add a free upgrade, support or campaign ally for the rest of the campaign (and, for the first two,
  removes the mission's own bad card, Panicked Refugees or the North American Sea Wall, from the campaign); defeating
  Liberate the Seattle Core lets each player shuffle a Desperate Measures into their deck each game. Failing a mission
  costs: Panicked Refugees in every deck, the Sea Wall in every encounter deck, the campaign allies removed, the
  Desperate Measures removed. The log's Setup/Defeated/Not-Defeated columns are three parallel instruction lists per
  option, not a success/failure pair, and a not-defeated mission is a penalty to show, never a reward to pick.
- **MC50's Board Members are game objects whose state is campaign state.** Secret counters carry over; at 4 (3 in
  expert) the environment flips to an attachment "_for the rest of the campaign_" (MC50 p. 6). This is a card instance
  whose face and counters are log state — not a number the log stores about a card.
- **MC16 "The Collection" removals are scenario-scoped, not campaign-scoped.** MC16 p. 12: cards recorded in the log are
  removed _from the game_ during scenario 3's setup only. Recorded in the log, but not a campaign removal (RRG p. 29).
  Ruling June 2, 2026 (3) answer 4 confirms the count, not the identity, is what carries.
- **MC45's Apocalypse scenario reuses the _other side_ of struck Overseer minions.** Ruling April 30, 2026 (4): "Prelate
  versions of minions remain available … even if their Overseer counterparts were crossed out." A campaign removal is
  by _card face_, not by physical card.
- **MC27's reputation track can be exceeded and can score negative.** MC27 p. 5 and ruling August 3, 2026 (4) answer 2:
  negative victory points mark no nodes. The track is a monotone counter with a clamp at zero per marking event.
- **MC10's Expert Campaign Sets are four _identical_ sets numbered 1–4**, selected by a per-seat player number
  (MC10 p. 17). The log's "player number" is a seat attribute with rules consequences, not cosmetic ordering.
- **Linked cards can never be granted.** Ruling August 3, 2026 (4) answer 3: "Linked cards cannot be included in decks",
  explicitly in the campaign-reward context. The existing `linked_card` refusal must stay absolute in campaign context.

## 2. Mode set

`ScenarioDifficulty` ("standard" | "expert") is today declared in `packages/content/src/schema/sets.ts:49` and is used
_by value_ in `packages/cards/src/{core,wave1,wave2}/setup.ts` and `packages/engine/src/setup.ts`
(`villainsForDifficulty`), and as a string union in `packages/client/src/engine/host.ts` (`SessionConfig.difficulty`,
which additionally carries wave 1's non-RRG `"extreme"`).

RRG 1.8 p. 29 defines four modifications of standard mode — expert, heroic, skirmish, campaign — and says each composes
with the others, per scenario. Expert _campaign_ is a modification of campaign mode, listed separately from expert
_mode_. So the axes are: expert, heroic level, skirmish version, campaign, expert campaign.

```ts
// @mc/content — packages/content/src/schema/modes.ts (new)

/** RRG 1.8 "Modes of Play" (p. 29). Every field is absent by default; absent everything is standard mode. */
export interface PlayModes {
  /** Expert mode: Expert encounter set, villain starts one stage later. */
  readonly expert?: true;
  /** Heroic level X: X extra encounter cards per player at villain phase step 3. Not built; typed now. */
  readonly heroic?: number;
  /** Skirmish (a.k.a. Rookie): one chosen villain version, the rest removed. Not built; typed now. */
  readonly skirmish?: { readonly villainVersion: string };
  /** Campaign mode: which campaign this scenario is being played as part of. */
  readonly campaign?: CampaignModeRef;
}

export interface CampaignModeRef {
  readonly campaignId: CampaignId;
  /** Expert *campaign* — orthogonal to `expert` (RRG 1.8 p. 29). Gates `Expert Campaign Only` instructions. */
  readonly expertCampaign?: true;
}

/** A mode gate on an instruction or a log field. All listed conditions must hold. */
export interface ModePredicate {
  readonly expert?: boolean;
  readonly expertCampaign?: boolean;
  readonly heroicAtLeast?: number;
}

export const STANDARD_MODES: PlayModes = {};
export const matchesModes = (modes: PlayModes, gate?: ModePredicate): boolean => {
  /* … */
};
```

**Migration, without breaking existing callers.** `ScenarioDifficulty` stays exactly as it is, re-expressed as a
projection:

```ts
/** The two-value projection the villain-stage tables and Standard/Expert set selection read. Unchanged shape. */
export type ScenarioDifficulty = "standard" | "expert";
export const difficultyOf = (modes: PlayModes): ScenarioDifficulty => (modes.expert ? "expert" : "standard");
export const modesOf = (difficulty: ScenarioDifficulty): PlayModes => (difficulty === "expert" ? { expert: true } : {});
```

| `cards/{core,wave1,wave2}/setup.ts` options         | add `modes?: PlayModes`; keep `difficulty?`; `modes` wins if both given, and giving both a `difficulty` and `modes.expert` that disagree throws |

| wave 1 `"extreme"`                                  | **stays out of `PlayModes`.** It is The Wrecking Crew's per-villain version choice (`villainVersions`), not an RRG mode.                        |

Nothing in `PlayModes` reaches `GameState`. What reaches the engine is the _resolved consequence_ of the modes: the
villain stage range, the encounter sets, and — new — `GameSetupConfig.campaign` (§5).

---

## 3. Where the campaign types and data live

Dependency direction is strictly `client → cards → engine → content`. Campaign setup/victory instructions read like card
text and must therefore be `EffectSpec`s, which are **engine** types. `@mc/content` cannot import `@mc/engine`.

**Decision:**

| Thing                                                                                                                | Package                                 | Why                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CampaignDefinition`, `CampaignLog`, `CampaignInstruction`, `CampaignOp`, `CampaignGameInput/Result` — the **types** | `@mc/engine` (`src/campaign.ts`)        | They reference `EffectSpec`/`Predicate`/`ValueSpec`. A type is not a campaign; the engine still never names one.      |
| The **runner** (`resolveBetweenGames`, `startGameFromLog`, `applyCampaignResult`)                                    | `@mc/engine` (`src/campaign/`)          | Pure, headless, deterministic — the same properties `applyCommand` already has.                                       |
| Each box's **`CampaignDefinition` object**                                                                           | `@mc/cards` (`src/campaigns/<code>.ts`) | It is authored with the ability DSL, exactly as card text is. `@mc/cards` already owns "printed words → engine data". |
| The `CampaignRegistry` handed to the runner                                                                          | `@mc/cards` (`src/campaigns/index.ts`)  | Mirrors `AbilityRegistry`/`EngineDeps`.                                                                               |
| `Campaign` record: id, name, packCode, scenarioIds, campaign set ids                                                 | `@mc/content`                           | Card-database facts. Needed by `validateDeck`, which lives in the engine and may only import content.                 |

`@mc/content`'s existing `Campaign` (`schema/sets.ts:241`) gains the fields legality needs:

```ts
export interface Campaign {
  readonly id: CampaignId;
  readonly name: string;
  readonly packCode: SetCode; // RRG p. 11: "from the same product (set icon)"
  readonly scenarioIds: readonly ScenarioId[];
  /** Encounter sets whose cards are campaign-specific to this campaign (MC10: `hydra_camp`). */
  readonly campaignSetIds: readonly EncounterSetId[];
  /** Per-seat numbered variants of one set (MC10 p. 17's four Expert Campaign Sets), seat 1..4 in order. */
  readonly perSeatSetIds?: readonly EncounterSetId[];
  /** Player cards and modular sets a box forbids *inside* its campaign (MC27 p. 4; MC40 p. 6). */
  readonly prohibited?: { readonly cardIds?: readonly CardId[]; readonly encounterSetIds?: readonly EncounterSetId[] };
}
```

**As built (step 6), two fields added beyond the sketch.** `boxCode: string` — the printed FFG code ("MC10"),
distinct from `packCode` (the internal `SetCode`, "trors") — because a citation or a client label needs the printed
code and nothing else on the record carries it. `logSheetReference: string` — a repo-relative path into
`docs/campaign-modes/log-sheets/`, the primary source the record (and the box's later `CampaignDefinition`) is
built from, in the same spirit as `StarterDeckProvenance.sources`. Both are `validateCampaign`'s to check.

---

## 4. `CampaignDefinition` — plain data, in `@mc/engine`

> **Built in `packages/engine/src/campaign.ts`.** The sketches below are the as-built shapes. Where the built type
> differs from the original sketch the difference is called out inline; the two structural ones are that every id with
> a `@mc/content` brand (`CampaignId`, `ScenarioId`, `CardId`, `EncounterSetId`) is typed as that brand rather than as
> `string`, and that the types this document referenced without declaring — `LogWriteSpec`, `LogWrite`,
> `CollectionFilter`, `CampaignLogSnapshot`, `CampaignStepTrace`, `ResolvedInstruction` — are declared below.

```ts
// @mc/engine — packages/engine/src/campaign.ts. No campaign or card is ever named in this file.

export interface CampaignDefinition {
  /** Matches a `@mc/content` `Campaign.id`. Opaque to the engine, which never compares it to a literal. */
  readonly campaignId: CampaignId;
  /** Bumped whenever an instruction id, log field id or node id changes. Stamped into every log. */
  readonly version: string;
  readonly logFields: readonly LogFieldDef[];
  readonly graph: CampaignGraph;
  readonly loss: LossPolicy;
  /** Instructions appended to *every* node's setup, in order, before the node's own (MC50's board prep, MC45's set). */
  readonly everyNodeSetup?: readonly CampaignInstruction[];
  readonly everyNodeVictory?: readonly CampaignInstruction[];
  /**
   * Instructions the log itself can switch on, keyed by id. A log field of type `instructionList` names entries here.
   * MC27 p. 22: each marked reputation node adds a `Setup:` instruction to every remaining scenario. Without this the
   * instruction list is not a function of the definition alone, and MC27 forces an engine change.
   */
  readonly conditionalInstructions?: Readonly<Record<string, CampaignInstruction>>;
}
```

### 4.1 Scenario graph

Not a list: MC60 branches (p. 8), and its "next" step mutates the log (p. 9 steps 1–3) before the choice is offered.

```ts
export type CampaignGraph =
  /** MC10, MC16, MC21, MC27, MC32, MC40, MC45, MC50: nodes played in order. */
  | { readonly kind: "linear"; readonly nodes: readonly CampaignNode[] }
  /** MC60: the players choose. `beforeChoice` runs first (progression), `available` gates each node. */
  | {
      readonly kind: "choice";
      readonly nodes: readonly CampaignNode[];
      readonly beforeChoice: readonly CampaignInstruction[];
      readonly available: CampaignPredicate;
      /** A node that becomes mandatory once `when` holds and nothing else is available (MC60's Kingpin). */
      readonly finale?: { readonly nodeId: string; readonly when: CampaignPredicate };
      /**
       * **Added in step 4.** How many `progressNode` marks fail a node. MC60 p. 9 step 3 says "If a scenario has
       * three Xs to its right, it has Failed" — three *printed boxes on that box's sheet*, so the threshold is the
       * box's number, not the engine's. Without it `progressNode` would either be uninterpretable or would hard-code
       * MC60's 3 in `@mc/engine`.
       */
      readonly progressToFail?: number;
    };

export interface CampaignNode {
  /** Stable id. Distinct from `scenarioId`: MC60 plays the same scenario id against a chosen villain. */
  readonly id: string;
  readonly label: string;
  /** Fixed scenario, or one composed between games (MC60 p. 9 step 5–6 picks the villain and its sets). */
  readonly scenario: CampaignScenarioRef;
  /** Between-games steps that decide what game to build: villain, extra encounter sets, set-aside cards. */
  readonly composition?: readonly CampaignInstruction[];
  readonly setup: readonly CampaignInstruction[];
  readonly victory: readonly CampaignInstruction[];
  /** MC50 p. 19 and MC60 p. 13. Empty for the seven boxes whose loss is "no penalty". */
  readonly defeat?: readonly CampaignInstruction[];
}

/** Named rather than inlined, so a client can switch on it without restating the union. */
export type CampaignScenarioRef =
  | { readonly kind: "fixed"; readonly scenarioId: ScenarioId }
  | { readonly kind: "composed" };
```

### 4.2 Log field schema, declared by the box

```ts
export type LogFieldType =
  | { readonly kind: "number"; readonly min?: number; readonly max?: number; readonly clampAtZero?: true }
  | { readonly kind: "flag" }
  /** An ordered list of card ids. Duplicates allowed (ruling June 2, 2026 (3) answer 3). */
  | { readonly kind: "cardList" }
  /** One card, optionally with which face is recorded (MC10 p. 12 Basic→Improved; MC27 p. 22 →Enhanced). */
  | { readonly kind: "cardRef"; readonly withFace?: true }
  /** A fixed option set: a role (MC32 p. 5), a villain (MC60 p. 9), a scenario outcome. */
  | { readonly kind: "choice"; readonly options: readonly string[] }
  /** Named options that stay "available" until struck (MC45 p. 5; MC40 p. 7). */
  | { readonly kind: "strikeList"; readonly options: readonly string[] }
  /** Counters that ride a named card across scenarios, with the face it is on (MC50 p. 6). */
  | { readonly kind: "cardState"; readonly cardIds: readonly CardId[] }
  /** Ids into `conditionalInstructions` (MC27 p. 22's reputation nodes). */
  | { readonly kind: "instructionList" }
  /** Freeform. Never read by an instruction; shown on the sheet only ("Notes"). */
  | { readonly kind: "text" };

export interface LogFieldDef {
  readonly id: string;
  /** As the printed sheet names it, so the rendered log matches the paper one. */
  readonly label: string;
  readonly scope: "shared" | "perSeat";
  readonly type: LogFieldType;
  /** Only tracked when these modes are on: persistent damage is `{ expertCampaign: true }`. */
  readonly whenModes?: ModePredicate;
  /** Never shown to the player (MC50 p. 5's A.I.M. envelope). Excluded from every view model. */
  readonly hidden?: true;
  /** "MC10 p. 7". Enforced format by the coverage test. */
  readonly citation: string;
}
```

### 4.3 Instructions

```ts
export interface CampaignInstruction {
  /** Stable, unique within the box: `"mc10.s2.victory.delay-counters"`. The coverage test resolves it. */
  readonly id: string;
  /** The printed sentence, verbatim. Shown in the between-games step list and in the log's history. */
  readonly text: string;
  readonly citation: string;
  /** `{ expertCampaign: true }` is the printed `Expert Campaign Only` prefix. */
  readonly whenModes?: ModePredicate;
  /** A log-state gate: "If Security Breach is in the campaign pool", "If Frightened Police Defeated is checked". */
  readonly when?: CampaignPredicate;
  readonly step: CampaignStep;
}

export type CampaignStep =
  /** Resolved by the engine inside the game, at a named window, as ordinary effects. */
  | { readonly kind: "inGame"; readonly window: CampaignWindow; readonly effects: readonly EffectSpec[] }
  /** Resolved by the campaign runner. No `GameState` exists. */
  | { readonly kind: "betweenGames"; readonly ops: readonly CampaignOp[] }
  /** Read the finished game and write the log. Victory/defeat instructions are mostly these. */
  | { readonly kind: "record"; readonly writes: readonly LogWriteSpec[] };
```

**The boundary between "in game" and "between games"** is exactly this: an instruction is `inGame` **iff it needs a
`GameState`** — putting a card into play, shuffling into the encounter deck, placing threat/counters/status, dealing an
encounter card, setting hit points. An instruction is `betweenGames` iff it only touches decks, the log, and player
choices — adding a card to a deck, spending currency, striking an option, choosing a role, choosing the next scenario.
A `record` instruction is the read half of the same boundary: it reads the _finished_ game's state and writes the log.

`CampaignWindow` — five values, all printed in some rulebook:

| #   | Window                | Meaning                                                                                      | Citation              |
| --- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1   | `beforeScenarioSetup` | before RRG Appendix II's scenario setup begins                                               | MC60 p. 9 steps 1–7   |
| 2   | `afterScenarioSetup`  | **the default.** After Appendix II step 12 (scenario setup abilities), before step 14 (draw) | MC10 p. 3 + MC50 p. 4 |
| 3   | `beforeStartingHands` | explicit synonym of the default, kept because MC50 prints it                                 | MC50 p. 4             |
| 4   | `beforePlayerSetup`   | the last thing before player setup (deck surgery)                                            | MC60 p. 9 step 8      |
| 5   | `afterMulligans`      | after Appendix II step 15                                                                    | MC50 p. 11            |

The `#` column is the order the engine resolves them in, exported as `CAMPAIGN_WINDOW_ORDER`. **As built:** windows
2–4 all name the same printed gap — after Appendix II step 12 and before step 14 — so their order relative to each
other is an engine convention (latest-sounding last), not a rule. No rulebook prints two of them for one scenario.
The draw is Appendix II **step 14**, not 13 (the original sketch miscounted); steps 15 and 16 are the mulligan and
the player setup abilities, as `flow.ts` has always had them.

The default's placement is a _reading_: MC10 p. 3 says only "set up the scenario as per the normal rules of the game.
Then, follow that scenario's setup instructions". MC50 p. 4 pins the same sentence to "before players draw their
starting hands", and MC10 p. 7's own "_Each player searches their deck for all cards with the setup keyword and puts
them into play_" is only coherent before the draw. Documented in the code comment, and exported as
`DEFAULT_CAMPAIGN_WINDOW` so no caller has to restate the reading; see Open question Q7.

**`LogWriteSpec` / `LogWrite` / `CampaignGameQuery`** — the `record` step's half, referenced above and declared here.
`CampaignGameQuery` is the plain-data form of the `fromGame.*` DSL builders (§7.2); it reuses `TargetQuery` so a
campaign instruction describes cards with exactly the vocabulary a card ability does.

```ts
export type CampaignGameQuery =
  | { readonly kind: "cardsThatEnteredPlay"; readonly query: TargetQuery } // MC10 p. 5
  | { readonly kind: "cardsRemovedFromGame"; readonly query: TargetQuery } // MC60 p. 13
  | { readonly kind: "cardsInPlay"; readonly query: TargetQuery } // MC50 p. 11
  // Added building MC10: cards *tucked* under a card in play are out of play (RRG 1.8 "Tuck"), so no in-play
  // selection reaches them — "record the name of each ally underneath it" (MC10 p. 12). A host that has left play
  // names nothing, which is the printed "if the … side scheme is still in play" condition.
  | { readonly kind: "cardsTuckedUnder"; readonly under: TargetQuery; readonly query: TargetQuery } // MC10 p. 12
  | { readonly kind: "cardsInVictoryDisplay"; readonly query: TargetQuery } // MC60 p. 13
  | { readonly kind: "countersOn"; readonly query: TargetQuery; readonly counter: string } // MC10 p. 7, MC50 p. 11
  | { readonly kind: "threatOn"; readonly query: TargetQuery } // MC60 p. 13
  | { readonly kind: "remainingHitPointsCappedAtBase" } // MC10 p. 17 — the cap is part of the query
  | { readonly kind: "isEngagedWithEnemy" } // MC10 p. 12
  | { readonly kind: "const"; readonly value: number | string | boolean } // MC60 p. 13's "check the box"
  | { readonly kind: "count"; readonly of: CampaignGameQuery }
  | { readonly kind: "atLeast"; readonly of: CampaignGameQuery; readonly amount: number };

export type LogWriteMode = "set" | "add" | "append" | "strike";

export interface LogWriteSpec {
  readonly field: string;
  readonly seat?: "self" | "each";
  readonly mode: LogWriteMode;
  readonly value: CampaignGameQuery;
}

/** The resolved form: what actually went into the log, for the log and for the history trace. */
export interface LogWrite {
  readonly field: string;
  /** By `CampaignSeat.seatNumber`; null for a shared or hidden field. */
  readonly seatNumber: number | null;
  readonly mode: LogWriteMode;
  readonly value: LogValue;
}
```

### 4.4 Values and predicates over the log

The in-game half reuses the engine's existing vocabulary, extended by exactly two members (built in `spec.ts`;
`seat` absent is the shared field, and several players resolve to the first, as every singular `PlayerRef` does):

```ts
// ValueSpec gains:
| { readonly kind: "campaignLog"; readonly field: string; readonly seat?: PlayerRef; readonly of?: "count" }
// Predicate gains (`of` added as built, so `atLeast` can count a list the same way the value does; `has` is
// `string` because the engine never names a card — a `CardId` is one):
| { readonly kind: "campaignLog"; readonly field: string; readonly seat?: PlayerRef; readonly has?: string;
    readonly atLeast?: number; readonly of?: "count"; readonly isSet?: boolean }
```

**As built**, `of: "count"` is what makes a list readable as a number; without it only a `number` field (its value)
and a `flag` field (1/0) read as anything but 0, so a misspelled field cannot read as a plausible number. Every
condition on the predicate is ANDed; with none given it asks whether the field is present at all, and a field the
frozen view does not carry satisfies `isSet: false` and nothing else. `campaign-state.ts` holds the readers, as
total functions: no campaign, no field, wrong kind and an unseated player all read as "nothing recorded".

The between-games half has its own tiny value language (no `GameState` to read):

````ts
export type CampaignValue =
  | { readonly kind: "const"; readonly value: number | string | boolean }

**Polarity, as built.** "Nothing recorded" is *false*, never true: a `flag` written from a value that resolves to
nothing (an unset field, a declined optional choice) is an **unchecked** box, and `fieldIsSet` is satisfied only by
a checked one, a non-empty list, or a `cardRef`/`choice` that names something. An earlier `logValueFor` wrote `true`
for an empty value, which made every "did this player decline?" read backwards; `@mc/engine`'s second synthetic
fixture pins both directions.

```ts
export type CampaignPredicate =
  | { readonly kind: "fieldAtLeast"; readonly field: string; readonly amount: number; readonly seat?: "self" }
  | { readonly kind: "fieldIsSet"; readonly field: string; readonly seat?: "self" }
  | { readonly kind: "fieldContains"; readonly field: string; readonly value: string; readonly seat?: "self" }
  | { readonly kind: "notStruck"; readonly field: string; readonly option: string }
  // Added building MC10: whether a `choose`/`random` slot earlier in this same step list picked anything. The
  // counterpart of `optional` on those ops — `not` of it is "this seat declined" (MC10 p. 12's "may replace").

### 4.5 `CampaignOp` — the between-games vocabulary

Every op is derived from a printed sentence in one of the ten rulebooks. This list is the foundation's real surface
area; adding a box must not require adding to it.

```ts
export type CampaignOp =
  // --- log writes ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | { readonly kind: "setField"; readonly field: string; readonly seat?: "self"; readonly value: CampaignValue }
  | { readonly kind: "addToField"; readonly field: string; readonly seat?: "self"; readonly value: CampaignValue }
  | { readonly kind: "appendToList"; readonly field: string; readonly seat?: "self"; readonly value: CampaignValue }
  // `seat` added as built: the field schema permits a per-seat `strikeList`, and an op that could not address one
  // would be a latent engine change.
  | { readonly kind: "strike"; readonly field: string; readonly seat?: "self"; readonly option: CampaignValue } // MC45 p. 5
  | { readonly kind: "clearField"; readonly field: string; readonly seat?: "self" }

      readonly optional?: true;
    }

   * building MC10) is the printed "each player **may** add 1 random obligation" (MC10 p. 7): the players decide
   * whether, never which, so the pending choice offers the single `CAMPAIGN_ACCEPT` token — an empty answer
   * declines, and the card still comes from the log's RNG. A declined draw records an empty pick (`choiceMade`).

  // --- graph ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | { readonly kind: "progressNode"; readonly node: CampaignValue } // MC60 p. 9 step 3
  | { readonly kind: "markNode"; readonly node: CampaignValue; readonly as: "completed" | "failed" }
  | { readonly kind: "endCampaign"; readonly result: "won" | "lost" } // MC45 p. 20

   */
  | {
      readonly kind: "campaignSet";

 */
export interface CollectionFilter {
  readonly categories?: readonly TargetCategory[]; // MC32 p. 5 "an event and/or an upgrade"; MC45 p. 24
  readonly aspects?: readonly string[]; // MC32 p. 5 "their role's associated aspects"

```

### 4.6 Loss policy — no engine default

```ts
export interface LossPolicy {
  /**
   * `"free"`: MC10 p. 3 / MC16 p. 4 / MC21 p. 4 / MC27 p. 4 / MC32 p. 4 / MC40 p. 6 / MC45 p. 4 — "they may reset
   * the scenario and try again with no penalty."
   * `"byInstruction"`: MC50 p. 19, MC60 p. 13 — the node's own `defeat` instructions run first.
   */
  readonly retry: "free" | "byInstruction";
  /** Campaign-wide defeat instructions, appended to every node's own (MC60 p. 9's expert progression). */
  readonly everyNodeDefeat?: readonly CampaignInstruction[];
  /**
   * What a retry restores. `"nodeStart"` replays the node against the log exactly as it stood when the node began,
   * *minus* anything the lost game removed from the campaign (RRG p. 29) and minus whatever `defeat` wrote.
   * MC40 p. 7 depends on this: a reward earned in a lost game is not kept, and the same side scheme must be re-chosen.
   */
  readonly retryBaseline: "nodeStart";
}
```

There is **no default**. A box's definition must state its policy; the coverage test fails a definition that omits it.

## 6. Campaign instructions as DSL

`@mc/cards` gets a `campaign` builder namespace beside the existing ability builders. It compiles to the plain data
above; it interprets nothing.

That is **five effect/value/selector members, two setup-step kinds, two state fields, four events.** Nothing else in
the engine changes shape. Crucially, the engine reads the campaign log only from the frozen `GameState.campaign.log`
snapshot; it never reaches out to storage, so `applyCommand` stays pure and `replay()` stays deterministic.

**As built (step 3), where the sketch above did not survive contact with the interpreter:**

- **Two step kinds, not four.** `{ kind: "campaignWindow"; window }` covers all five windows — five near-identical
  `GameStep` kinds would be five copies of one branch in every switch — and `scenarioSetup` is new: Appendix II
  steps 6–12 had to become a step of its own so `beforeScenarioSetup` can resolve _before_ it and stop for a choice.
  Both exist **only in a campaign game**: `createGame` still runs steps 6–12 inline (`resolveScenarioSetup`, shared
  code, one call site each) when there is no campaign, so a standalone game's state and event stream are unchanged.
  `stepAfterCampaignWindow` switches exhaustively on `CampaignWindow`, so a new window cannot be added without
  being given a place in the flow.
- **`GameState.campaign` and `GameState.campaignWrites` are absent, not null,** outside a campaign, so a standalone
  game's serialized state is byte for byte what it was before campaign mode existed and every save still replays.
- **In-game writes accumulate in `GameState.campaignWrites`** (`CampaignInGameWrites`: the `LogWrite`s and the
  removed `CampaignCardFace`s) rather than being reduced out of the event stream. A game never touches anything
  outside `GameState`; the runner folds them in whatever the outcome, which is what keeps a lost game's writes
  distinguishable from the between-games writes `retryBaseline` rolls back (§6.2, Q6).
- **`campaignLogRead` is emitted for the `CardSelector` read only.** `ValueSpec`/`Predicate` reads happen inside
  `resolveValue`/`evaluate`, which are pure and re-entrant and which legality checks, `preview()` and `why-not.ts`
  call speculatively; emitting there would log reads that never happened and make the event stream depend on which
  questions a client asked. Those reads stay reconstructible instead — the log is frozen in state.
- **The write's value is its own small union**, `CampaignLogValueSpec` (`number` / `flag` / `cardList` / `cardRef` /
  `choice` / `text`), in the engine's _in-game_ vocabulary (`ValueSpec`, `Predicate`, `CardSelector`) rather than
  the between-games `CampaignGameQuery`. A strike is `mode: "strike"` with a `choice` value, exactly as
  `LogWriteSpec` spells it; `strikeList`/`instructionList`/`cardState` are never written in one in-game sentence.
- **`createGame` refuses a campaign whose `seats` do not line up with `players`**, because seat-by-seat alignment is
  what makes a per-seat read addressable (the seat _numbers_ are the log's own — MC10 p. 17).

### 6.2 In-game card text that touches the log

MC10's Hydra Campaign TECH upgrades print "_Setup. Hero Action: Discard this card and remove it from the campaign log →
deal 5 damage …_" (MC10 p. 5 card text). These are ordinary card abilities scripted in `@mc/cards/src/wave2/trors/` —
the 30 refs currently parked in `KNOWN_SKIPPED.trors` (04155–04166). They use the same `removeFromCampaign` primitive a
between-games instruction uses; there is no second path. MC10 p. 12's Q&A defines the semantics: "_cross it out of the
campaign log. That card is no longer part of the campaign and cannot be included in any deck for the remainder of the
campaign_", and RRG p. 29 adds that it survives a retry.

Because a removal made in a _lost_ game still sticks, `removeFromCampaign` effects are folded into the log
**regardless of the game's outcome** (§7). This is the one place where a lost game writes the log in MC10.

A removal also takes the card out of every seat's deck and grant list, so no player edits a deck to honour it: the
runner drops every copy of a front-face removal from `CampaignSeat.deck` and `grants` after each game, win or lose
(after a loss restores the decks from `logBefore`), and again whenever it composes a game, which cleans a run saved
before this existed; the client's `CampaignService.load` does the same for the deck screen. A removal naming the other
face of a double-sided card leaves the deck alone. A deck this leaves below its minimum stays that way on purpose:
MC10 p. 12 has the player choose the card to add, and `validateDeck` already says so.

As built, the effect is a **log operation only**: it records the face (`CampaignCardFace`, ruling April 30, 2026 (4))
in `GameState.campaignWrites` and does nothing to the card in this game — what happens to the card is whatever the
printed sentence beside it says ("Discard this card **and** remove it from the campaign log"), scripted as its own
effect. Recording the same face twice records it once; a second _face_ of the same card is a separate removal, which
is the point of the ruling.

### 7.1 Inputs

```ts
export interface CampaignGameInput {
  readonly campaignId: CampaignId;
  readonly nodeId: string;
  readonly definitionVersion: string;
  readonly modes: PlayModes;
  /** Every log value this game may read, flattened and frozen. Hidden fields are excluded unless read by one. */
  readonly log: CampaignLogView;
  /** Already filtered by mode and by `when`, already in printed order, grouped by window. */
  readonly instructions: readonly ResolvedInstruction[];
  /** Cards removed from the campaign, so nothing can re-enter through a search. By face (`CampaignCardFace`). */
  readonly removedFromCampaign: readonly CampaignCardFace[];
  /** Per seat: the deck list as the campaign composed it, and which of those cards are campaign grants. */
  readonly seats: readonly CampaignSeatInput[];
  /** Seed for anything the *in-game* instructions randomize; drawn from the log's RNG. */
  readonly seed: number;
}

/**
 * As built, this is **not** `CampaignLogSnapshot`. The original sketch used one name for two jobs: restoring a
 * retry (which needs the decks, the RNG and the graph position) and being read in-game (which needs none of them,
 * and which lands in `GameState` and every save). The in-game half is its own, narrower type.
 */
export interface CampaignLogView {
  readonly shared: Readonly<Record<string, LogValue>>;
  readonly perSeat: readonly { readonly seatNumber: number; readonly fields: Readonly<Record<string, LogValue>> }[];
}

/** Declared as built, in the shape `PlayerSetup` consumes — hence the identity and the aspects, which it requires. */
export interface CampaignSeatInput {
  readonly seatNumber: number;
  readonly identityCardId: CardId;
  /** The expanded deck list, grants included. */
  readonly deck: readonly CardId[];
  readonly aspects: readonly CoreAspect[];
  readonly grantedCardIds: readonly CardId[];
}

/** Declared as built: an instruction the runner has already gated and ordered, ready to resolve at its window. */
export interface ResolvedInstruction {
  readonly instructionId: string;
  readonly text: string;
  readonly citation: string;
  readonly window: CampaignWindow;
  readonly effects: readonly EffectSpec[];
}
```

Because `CampaignGameInput` is part of `GameSetupConfig`, it lands in `GameState` and therefore in
`StoredGame.initialState` — the replay baseline. **A saved campaign game replays without consulting the campaign log at
all.** That is the property that keeps replay deterministic while the log keeps evolving underneath.

### 7.2 Outputs

```ts
export interface CampaignGameResult {
  readonly nodeId: string;
  /** As built: `"won" | "lost"`, the same words `CampaignHistoryEntry.outcome` uses — one vocabulary, not two. */
  readonly outcome: "won" | "lost";
  /** Each `record` instruction's computed value, in printed order, with the instruction id that produced it. */
  readonly records: readonly { readonly instructionId: string; readonly write: LogWrite }[];
  /** `removeFromCampaign` effects that resolved in-game. Applied even on a loss (RRG p. 29). By face. */
  readonly removedFromCampaign: readonly CampaignCardFace[];
  /** `recordInCampaignLog` effects that resolved in-game. Applied even on a loss. */
  readonly logWrites: readonly LogWrite[];
  /** Grants with `permanence: "thisGame"`, expiring now (MC32 p. 5's role upgrades). */
  readonly expiringGrants: readonly CardId[];
}
```

`campaignResultOf` is a **derived reducer over the finished state and the event stream**, exactly like
`client/src/engine/game-record.ts` is today — never something the client accumulates and hands back. `fromGame.*` in
the DSL compiles to queries this reducer answers (cards that entered play matching a query, counters on a named card,
remaining hit points capped at base, whether a named scheme is in the victory display, which players are engaged with
an enemy, how many cards of a title are across all player decks).

### 7.3 The runner, as built (step 4)

`packages/engine/src/campaign/` — `log.ts` (the working log and the one place a write happens), `ops.ts` (every
`CampaignValue`, `CampaignPredicate`, `CampaignChoiceSource` and `CampaignOp`, exhaustively, with no `default:`),
`result.ts` (`campaignResultOf`), `runner.ts` (the public API). All of it re-exported from `@mc/engine`.

```ts
createCampaignLog(definition, { id, seats, modes, poolVersion, seed }): CampaignLog
resolveBetweenGames(definition, log, deps, modes?, answers?): CampaignRunnerResult<CampaignLog>
startGameFromLog(definition, log): CampaignGameStart
campaignResultOf(definition, log, finalState, events, engineDeps?): CampaignGameResult
applyCampaignResult(definition, log, result, { at, gameId }, deps, answers?): CampaignRunnerResult<CampaignLog>

type CampaignRunnerResult<T> = { kind: "done"; value: T } | { kind: "pending"; choice: CampaignPendingChoice };
interface CampaignDeps { pool: CardPool; perSeatSetIds?: readonly EncounterSetId[] }
```

**Pending-choice re-entry is re-running.** A step list that reaches a `choose` with no recorded answer returns that
one choice (`{ instructionId, slot, seatNumber, text, citation, chooser, options, count, optional }`) and changes
_nothing_; the caller answers it and calls the same function again with the enlarged answer list, and the list runs
from the top. Nothing partial is ever persisted, so `(log, answers)` is the complete input. One choice at a time,
not all of them, because a later choice's options can depend on an earlier one. The runner's own "which scenario
next?" prompt (MC60 p. 9 step 4) uses the same shape under the reserved instruction id `campaign.nextNode`.

`campaignResultOf` takes the **log** rather than the node the sketch passed: the log's `attempt` is what says which
node was played and under which modes, and `expiringGrants` is a fact about the log's grants that no game state can
tell you. It computes every `record` of the matching branch whose `whenModes` pass, and leaves the `when` predicate
(which reads the _log_) to `applyCampaignResult`.

`applyCampaignResult` is pure `(defn, log, result, meta, deps, answers) → { log } | { pendingChoice }`:

1. On a **loss**, restore the log to `attempt.logBefore` first (`retryBaseline: "nodeStart"`), carrying the current
   `removedFromCampaign` across unrestored.
2. Expire `thisGame` grants — the grants the _finished game_ carried, not ones a victory step is about to make.
3. Apply the game's own `logWrites` and `removedFromCampaign`. They stick whatever the outcome (RRG p. 29; §6.2).
4. On a **win**: run `everyNodeVictory` then the node's `victory`; then mark the node `completed` if no op did, and
   advance `position`. With every node resolved and no `endCampaign` op fired, the campaign ends `won` if every node
   is `completed` and `lost` otherwise.
5. On a **loss**: run the node's `defeat` then `loss.everyNodeDefeat`, but only when `loss.retry === "byInstruction"`;
   then `position.nextNodeId` becomes the node again unless a defeat op resolved it.
6. Append the history entry (`attempt.steps` ++ this run's steps) and clear `attempt`.

### 7.4 Readings the runner had to make, flagged rather than silently chosen

| Question                                                                 | What step 4 does                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Where does `logBefore` sit for a `choice` graph?                         | Before `beforeChoice`, so a retry re-runs the progression draw from the restored RNG and reproduces it exactly. The alternative (after it) double-counts a progression.    |
| `seat: "self"` on an op with no `forEachSeat` around it                  | Runs once per seat, each with its own slot values — "Each player chooses … and adds it to their deck" (MC10 p. 5) is one instruction, not a loop.                          |
| `seat: "self"` on a _predicate_, with no seat scope                      | "any seat satisfies it", because the gates printed that way read "If a player has …".                                                                                      |
| `CampaignChoiceSource.excludeGranted`                                    | **Group-wide**: the physical card is taken. MC16 p. 5 prints exactly that for its Market. No box prints the per-seat reading.                                              |
| `fieldAtLeast` on a list field (the between-games predicate has no `of`) | Counts the entries; a `number`/`flag` field reads its value. The in-game `Predicate` keeps its explicit `of: "count"`.                                                     |
| Where `conditionalInstructions` land in a node's setup                   | After `everyNodeSetup`, before the node's own, shared fields then seat fields, **each id once**. MC27 p. 22 does not say, and resolving one twice would double it.         |
| A `hidden` field declared `perSeat`                                      | Reads and writes as shared, because `CampaignLog.hidden` is one flat map. No rulebook prints a per-seat secret.                                                            |
| `LogFieldType` `cardState`                                               | **Cannot be written.** Neither `CampaignGameQuery` nor `CampaignValue` can compose counters-plus-face, so a write to one throws instead of guessing. A real gap — see Q11. |

---

## 8. Deck rules in campaign context

`validateDeck(deck, pool)` gains an optional third argument. Its existing behavior with no context is unchanged, so no
current caller moves. **Built in step 5** (`packages/engine/src/deck.ts`); the sketch's single `forbiddenCardIds` is
split, because the design's own table below wants two different problem codes for the two different rules, and
because a removal is by _face_:

```ts
export interface DeckContext {
  readonly campaign?: CampaignDeckContext;
}

export interface CampaignDeckContext {
  readonly campaignId: string;
  /** `Campaign.campaignSetIds` + `perSeatSetIds` — which campaign-specific cards are legal here (RRG p. 11). */
  readonly campaignSetIds: readonly string[];
  /** MC10 p. 3: identity locked for the campaign. */
  readonly identityCardId: string;
  /** One entry per granted *copy*: legal here, and exempt from min/max deck size (MC10 p. 3). */
  readonly grantedCardIds: readonly string[];
  /** RRG p. 29 removals, **by face** (ruling April 30, 2026 (4)): only a front-face removal refuses a deck line. */
  readonly removedFromCampaign?: readonly CampaignCardFace[];
  /** The box's own prohibitions *inside* its campaign (MC27 p. 4; MC40 p. 6) — a different rule, a different code. */
  readonly prohibitedCardIds?: readonly string[];
  readonly prohibitedEncounterSetIds?: readonly string[];
  /** MC16 p. 5 (mandatory) / MC27 p. 6 (optional): aspect and basic cards frozen after scenario 1. */
  readonly frozenNonCampaignCards?: readonly DeckCardEntry[];
}
```

**The Q8 decision point** is the exported constant `CAMPAIGN_GRANTS_COUNT_TOWARD_COPY_LIMIT` in
`packages/engine/src/deck.ts`, now `true` (decided 2026-09-25; see Q8). MC10 never reaches it: its grants are
campaign-specific cards, which never get as far as the copy-limit check. Alongside it, `validateDeck` exempts granted
copies of an aspect card from the deck's aspect restriction ("from any aspect"), `grantCard`'s `copies: "maximum"`
tops a title up to its limit (`copiesUpToLimit`), and a `collection` choice offers only cards legal for the seat's
identity (`cardLegalForIdentity`).

Two further notes from building it. A **legal** campaign-specific card short-circuits the rest of the line checks
exactly as the refused one always did, so it is not counted toward deck size and the copy limit does not reach it —
the change is only _whether a problem is reported_. And the **freeze** compares only the copies the player chose:
granted copies are subtracted from both sides, so a frozen deck still lets the campaign keep adding its own cards.

And in `packages/content/src/schema/validation.ts`, `validateScenarioEncounterSets` gains an optional
`ScenarioModeContext` (`{ campaignId?: CampaignId; campaignSetIds?: readonly EncounterSetId[] }`): a campaign-specific
set is legal iff the scenario is being validated as part of a campaign _and_ the set is one of that campaign's own —
RRG p. 11's set-icon test, expressed as list membership until `Campaign.campaignSetIds` lands in step 6. The
standalone refusal now states the rule ("a campaign-specific set can only be used during a campaign from the same
product") instead of "campaign mode is not built"; the `competitiveOnly` refusal is unchanged, because competitive
mode really is not built.

## 9. Registration and extensibility

### 9.1 Adding box N+1 — the complete file list

| #   | File                                            | Owner                        | Change                                       |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `packages/content/src/data/<pack>/campaign.ts`  | `card-data-pipeline`         | the `Campaign` record; any missing card data |
| 2   | `packages/content/src/data/index.ts`            | `card-data-pipeline`         | one export line                              |
| 3   | `packages/cards/src/campaigns/<code>.ts`        | `ability-scripting-engineer` | the `CampaignDefinition`                     |
| 4   | `packages/cards/src/campaigns/index.ts`         | `ability-scripting-engineer` | one entry in `CAMPAIGNS`                     |
| 5   | `packages/cards/src/campaigns/coverage.test.ts` | `ability-scripting-engineer` | one row in `CAMPAIGN_STATUS`                 |
| 6   | `packages/cards/src/campaigns/<code>.test.ts`   | `rules-qa-engineer`          | the box's ruling-tied scenarios              |

**No engine file. No client file.** Files 2, 4 and 5 are the only shared ones, one line each.

### 9.2 Adding one new campaign card

1. `packages/content/src/data/<pack>/cards.ts` — the record, with `specificTo: { kind: "campaign", encounterSetId }`.
2. `packages/cards/src/<pack>/campaign-cards.ts` — its ability script (an ordinary card script).
3. If a `choose` op must offer it: it is already offered, because `campaignSet(setId)` enumerates the set. Only an
   explicit `cards([...])` source would need the id added.

### 9.3 Coverage test

`packages/cards/src/campaigns/coverage.test.ts`, in the style of `wave2/coverage.test.ts` (exact-match pinning, no
passing by omission). It fails when a box's definition references something that does not resolve:

- `CAMPAIGN_STATUS` covers exactly the campaigns `@mc/content` exports (a new box cannot be silently unchecked).
- Every `CampaignNode.scenario.scenarioId` resolves in `@mc/content`'s scenarios and belongs to the box's pack.
- Every `CampaignOp`/`CampaignValue`/`CampaignPredicate` `field` is declared in `logFields`, with the right
  `LogFieldType` for the op (`strike` needs a `strikeList`, `spend` needs a `number`, …).
- Every `LogFieldDef` is read or written by at least one instruction — dead fields are a bug. `KNOWN_UNUSED` escape for
  `{ kind: "text" }` fields only.
- Every card id named by an instruction is in `POOL`, and if `specificTo.kind === "campaign"` its set is in the box's
  `campaignSetIds`.
- Every `inGame` instruction's `EffectSpec[]` passes the DSL validator, and every ability id it references resolves in
  `PLAYABLE_ABILITIES`.
- Every `instructionList` field's option ids resolve in `conditionalInstructions`.
- Every `citation` matches `/^MC\d{2} p\. \d+$/`; every instruction id is unique within the box and prefixed with it.
- `LossPolicy` is present.
- The graph is well-formed: node ids unique, `finale.nodeId` exists, a `linear` graph is fully connected.

## 10. Persistence and client surface

### 10.1 Storage

A **third IndexedDB database, `mc-campaigns`**, separate from `mc-saves` and `mc-decks` for the reason
`deck-storage.ts` already documents: a campaign write must never be able to break a game resume, and the cheapest
guarantee is never opening the same database.

**As built (step 10), where storage differs from the sketch above.** `create`/`put`/`load` are typed over
`CampaignRecord`, not a bare `CampaignLog`:

```ts
/** CampaignLog plus the listing metadata `@mc/engine` has no way to hold (it never names a box). */
export interface CampaignRecord extends CampaignLog {
  readonly recordSchema: number;
  readonly name: string; // @mc/content `Campaign.name`
  readonly box: string; // @mc/content `Campaign.boxCode`
  readonly createdAt: number;
  readonly updatedAt: number;
}

export interface CampaignStorage {
  /** Rejects a duplicate id rather than overwriting — a campaign, unlike a game, is never replaced by starting another. */
  create(record: CampaignRecord): Promise<void>;
  /** Whole-record write. A campaign step is small and must be atomic; there is no append-log equivalent here. */
  put(record: CampaignRecord): Promise<void>;
  load(id: string): Promise<CampaignRecord | null>;
  list(): Promise<readonly CampaignSummary[]>;
  setStatus(id: string, status: CampaignStatus): Promise<void>;
}
```

The sketch's `create(log: CampaignLog)` had nowhere to put a box's display name and code — `@mc/engine` holds
neither, by the same discipline that keeps it from naming a card — so a caller folds in the `@mc/content` `Campaign`
record's `name`/`boxCode` and two timestamps once, at creation, the same shape `SaveMeta` already uses for a game.
`list()` projects each `CampaignRecord` down to a `CampaignSummary` (id, `campaignId`, `recordSchema`, `CampaignLog`'s
own `schema`/`definitionVersion`, `name`, `box`, `status`, `modes`, `position`, a seat's number and identity only,
`createdAt`/`updatedAt`) — the same "small summary row, no ~68 KB payload" instinct `game-storage.ts` uses, scaled
down: a `CampaignLog` is small enough that one object store holds the whole record, unlike `mc-saves`'s three.

Two implementations sharing one contract test (`MemoryCampaignStorage`, `IdbCampaignStorage`), exactly as
`game-storage.test.ts` does today — see `packages/client/src/engine/campaign-storage.ts`,
`idb-campaign-storage.ts` and `campaign-storage.test.ts`.

`SaveMeta` (`client/src/engine/game-storage.ts`) gains `campaignId: string | null` and `campaignNodeId: string | null`,
so the campaign browser can link to the played game and the game-over screen knows it must return to the campaign.
`SessionConfig` gains `campaign?: CampaignGameInput`, attached to `GameSetupConfig` after `buildScenario` runs
(`session-core.ts`'s `scenarioFor`), never threaded through the scenario builder's own options — the same
`createGame({ ...config, campaign: start.input }, deps)` shape `@mc/cards`'s `trors.test.ts` already uses.
`SAVE_SCHEMA` bumps to 4.

**As built, one deliberate departure from every earlier `SAVE_SCHEMA` bump.** Schema 2 and 3 each changed
`StateWithoutPool`'s shape, so an old save was retired rather than migrated (`game-storage.ts`'s own doc comment).
Schema 4 changes nothing about replayable state — it only adds metadata about which campaign, if any, a save
belongs to — so a save written under schema 3 is instead upgraded on read (`migrateSaveMeta`, applied in every
storage's `load`/`list`/`latestActive`): `campaignId`/`campaignNodeId` fill in `null` (a pre-campaign save was never
part of one) and the save resumes exactly as it always did. `game-storage.test.ts` proves both halves: schema 2 is
still retired (the multi-villain state change), schema 3 still loads and resumes.

### 10.2 View models (plain TS, Vitest; no scene design here)

| Model                               | Shows                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `campaign-list-model.ts`            | one row per campaign: box name, modes, position ("Scenario 3 of 5" / "2 of 5 completed"), seats, status, last played; the Continue / Abandon affordances                                            |
| `campaign-log-model.ts`             | the printed sheet: shared boxes and per-seat columns, each field with its `label`, `citation` and rendered value. `hidden` fields render as "not yet known" and the value is never in the model.    |
| `campaign-step-model.ts`            | the between-games step list: each resolved instruction's printed `text` + `citation` + what it did, and the pending `choose` prompts with their option lists                                        |
| `campaign-deck-edit-model.ts`       | wraps `validateDeck(deck, pool, { campaign })`; grants render as locked rows marked "added by the campaign — does not count toward deck size"; frozen decks disable editing with the printed reason |
| `campaign-scenario-choice-model.ts` | `kind: "choice"` graphs only (MC60): the available nodes, each node's progress marks, the villain choice, and the Completed/Failed environments already in play                                     |

**As built (step 11).** `campaign-list-model.ts`'s compatibility check (`schema`/`definitionVersion` against this
build's registered `CampaignDefinition`, `@mc/cards`'s `campaignDefinitionOf`) is read-only: it exposes
`canResume`/`incompatibleReason` per row but never calls `CampaignStorage.setStatus` itself, the same "ask, don't
decide" split `EngineSessionCore.latestSave()` keeps for `SaveMeta.schema`. `campaign-step-model.ts` also carries
`campaignLaunchConfig` (a composed log, via `startGameFromLog`, to a `SessionConfig` — the "next-scenario launch"
capability) and `campaignPostGameFold` (`campaignResultOf` + `applyCampaignResult` composed in the one order that's
ever correct — the "post-game fold" capability), since both are the same between-games boundary design §7
describes and neither needed a sixth file. `campaign-deck-edit-model.ts` also exports `campaignDeckContextOf`,
assembling `CampaignDeckContext` from a `@mc/content` `Campaign` record and a seat's `CampaignLog` column —
`frozenNonCampaignCards` (MC16 p. 5 / MC27 p. 6) has no generic source in the log, so it stays an explicit optional
input; MC10 never freezes a deck, so its own tests never pass one. `campaign-scenario-choice-model.ts` is validated
against a synthetic `kind: "choice"` fixture only: no box with that graph shape has shipped yet (MC60 only), and it
never evaluates `CampaignGraph.available` itself — the available-node set it renders always comes from a real
`CampaignPendingChoice` the runner already produced, never re-derived client-side.

| 12  | **Landed. Gate passed: MC21 fits.** Acceptance gate for "content-only": MC21's definition written against the frozen foundation, test-only (no `@mc/content` MC21 record exists yet — see the note below the table). Diff touches only `packages/cards` (plus this doc and a changie entry): no `packages/engine` campaign-foundation or `packages/client` change was needed (the later `ValueSpec deckCount` follow-up is an ordinary in-game value primitive MC21's card kit needs anyway, not a foundation change). One content-only DSL addition (`addAccelerationToken` gained an optional `target`). One genuine gap found and left as `// TODO(gap 1)`, not worked around — since closed by the engine's `ValueSpec deckCount`; see the note below the table. | `ability-scripting-engineer` | `packages/cards/src/campaigns/mts.gate.test.ts`: shape assertions (citations, unique/prefixed ids, every referenced log field declared) plus the runner end to end (`createCampaignLog` → `resolveBetweenGames` → `startGameFromLog` → a hand-authored `CampaignGameResult` → `applyCampaignResult`), all five nodes, a loss and retry on Tower Defense, and a second walk proving Loki's Expert-Campaign-Only defeat block ends the campaign lost |

**Step 7, as built: the six gaps the first real box found.** Each is general, and none of them names a box:

1. `CampaignChoiceSource` `campaignSet`/`perSeatSet` take a `CollectionFilter` — one printed set is not one printed
   choice (MC10 p. 5's TECH upgrades vs. p. 7's Condition upgrades, in one set). The filter is _not_ a deckbuilding
   test; only `collection`/`ownDeck` apply that (§4.5).
2. `CampaignGameQuery` `cardsTuckedUnder` (§4.3b) — the cards under a host card, which no in-play selection sees.
3. `CampaignOp` `random` takes `optional`, answered with the exported `CAMPAIGN_ACCEPT` token (§4.5).
4. `CampaignPredicate` `choiceMade`, plus the polarity fix in §4.4: nothing recorded is an _unchecked_ box.
5. `validateDeck` exempts a granted `specificTo.kind === "scenario"` card (§8).
6. `validateDeck` exempts a granted `obligation` (§8), which stays illegal as a deckbuilding choice.

`packages/engine/src/testing/campaign.ts` now carries a **second** one-node synthetic box
(`SYNTHETIC_EXTRAS_CAMPAIGN`) for exactly these members plus `LossPolicy.retry: "free"`, kept separate from the
branching fixture so that neither box's `random` draws or choice options move when the other changes.

**One sharp edge, flagged rather than changed.** `excludeGranted` reads the _grants_, so a table-wide single-copy
pool must be written as a `forEachSeat` that chooses and grants per seat; a flat `choose` with
`chooser: "eachSeat"` asks every seat before any `grantCard` runs, so two seats could name the same copy. Both
fixtures and `trors.ts` use the per-seat shape, and `ops.ts` says so where `anyGranted` is defined.

**Step 6, as built.** `Campaign` (`packages/content/src/schema/sets.ts`) gained two fields the §3 sketch didn't
carry: `boxCode` (the printed FFG code, "MC10" — distinct from `packCode`, the internal `SetCode`) and
`logSheetReference` (a repo-relative path into `docs/campaign-modes/log-sheets/`, the primary source the record and
the box's eventual campaign definition are built from). Both are validated by `validateCampaign`
(`packages/content/src/schema/validation.ts`).

Only `packages/content/src/data/trors/campaign.ts` (`TRORS_CAMPAIGN`) exists. Of the nine boxes with a campaign
mode, `@mc/content` has ingested full `Pack`/`Scenario`/`EncounterSet` records for exactly one — `trors` (MC10) —
plus `toafk`, which has no campaign of its own. The other eight (`gmw`, `mts`, `sm`, `mut_gen`, `next_evol`, `aoa`,
`aos`, `fne`) exist only as raw MarvelCDB JSON (`packages/content/raw/marvelcdb/`), not as normalized `@mc/content`
data — `docs/phase7-wave2-data.md`'s per-pack survey lists real, unresolved normalization gaps in each (28–86 open
issues per pack as of that survey). A `Campaign` record naming a scenario or encounter set that does not exist
would be exactly the kind of fabricated reference this package's ingestion discipline exists to refuse (CLAUDE.md,
"don't fabricate stats or text"), so none was emitted for those eight. This is not a gap in step 6's scope: PLAN.md
§C2's own gate already requires "that box's own heroes, villains and scenarios scripted" before its campaign
content is built — a `Campaign` record for one of the eight is unblocked the same moment its own box's card data
lands, following the same file (`<pack>/campaign.ts`) and test shape `trors` established
(`packages/content/src/data/campaigns.test.ts`).

**Step 12, as built.** Because MC21 has no `@mc/content` record (the same reason step 6 skipped it), its
`CampaignDefinition` lives entirely in a test file, `packages/cards/src/campaigns/mts.gate.test.ts` — never
registered in `campaigns/index.ts`, never exported, and using only synthetic (`mc21-syn-*`) scenario/card/
encounter-set ids, the same discipline `engine/src/testing/campaign.ts`'s `SYNTHETIC_CAMPAIGN` already uses. Every
printed "CAMPAIGN INSTRUCTIONS" bullet (MC21 pp. 7, 13, 17, 21, 25) and the general campaign-mode/expert-campaign
rules (pp. 4, 25) are encoded, in printed order, cited per instruction — the scenario mechanics themselves (Spell
environments, Tower Defense's two main schemes/two villains, Hela's infinite hit points, Loki's five stage-I
cards) are left to future scenario card scripts, exactly as MC10's own non-campaign mechanics are.

**The gate passed.** Every instruction fits the frozen vocabulary. One content-only DSL builder gained a parameter
it didn't have (`addAccelerationToken(target?)`, `packages/cards/src/dsl/effects.ts` — MC21 p. 13's "place one
acceleration token on **one of** the main schemes" needs to name which one; MC10 never needed to point one). No
`CampaignOp`/`CampaignGameQuery`/`CampaignPredicate`/`CampaignValue` member was added, and neither `packages/engine`
nor `packages/client` changed. Two shapes the foundation already carries for exactly this reason turned out to
matter for a real second box: `CampaignGameQuery`'s lack of a negation combinator, worked around with the
record-a-bridge-then-`not(fieldIsSet(...))` pattern `trors.ts` had already established for MC10's Hydra Prison
(MC21's "was defeated" / "is NOT in the victory display" bullets); and `CampaignOp composeEncounterSets`, used to
carry a campaign-pool card (Cosmo, Security Breach, Black Swan, Odin) into a later scenario that does not share a
modular set with the one that earned it — provably necessary for Security Breach, whose earning scenario's
encounter deck ("Ebony Maw, Black Order, Armies of Titan, Standard") and spending scenario's ("Tower Defense,
Armies of Titan, Standard") do not share the Black Order set.

**One genuine gap**, left `// TODO(gap 1)` rather than worked around: no `ValueSpec` read a player's deck size
(only `handCount`/`handSize` existed), so "each player discards the top half of their deck" (MC21 pp. 21, 25) could
not be computed to pass as the `zone` `CardSelector`'s `top: ValueSpec`. Not campaign-mode-specific — this pack's
own card kit independently needs the same primitive (`docs/cards/by_pack/mts.md` prints an MC21 card's own When
Revealed, "removes the top half of their deck (rounded down) from the game").

**Gap 1 is closed** (`game-rules-architect`). `ValueSpec` gained `{ kind: "deckCount"; player: PlayerRef }` — the
sibling of `handCount`, counting the player deck only (never a separate deck or the encounter deck) — resolved in
`resolveValue` (`packages/engine/src/select.ts`), with `deckCountOf(player?)` in `packages/cards/src/dsl/values.ts`
and unit tests in `packages/engine/src/deck-count.test.ts` (empty deck, after draws, per-seat in a 2-player game,
halving both directions, and feeding a `zone` selector's `top` end to end). The value is a plain count: halving
stays `scaled.divide`, whose `round` is required. Both `TODO(gap 1)` markers in `mts.gate.test.ts` are now the real
instruction, `forEachPlayer(eachPlayer, moveCards(zone("deck", thatPlayer, { top: scaled(deckCountOf(thatPlayer),
{ divide: { by: 2, round: "down" } }) }), "discard"))`, pinned by a shape assertion. **Rounding down** (decided
2026-09-22): the printed campaign bullet names no direction; RRG 1.8 "Modifiers" (p. 29, "Fractional values are
rounded up after all modifiers have been applied") is about modified values rather than halving a deck, and MC21's
own card with the near-identical sentence prints "(rounded down)", so the bullet follows the card. No ruling covers
it; flagged for FFG.

Because the end-to-end walk cannot reach `@mc/engine`'s internal `testing/fixtures.ts` stub-card builders from
`@mc/cards` (`@mc/engine`'s `package.json` exports only `"."`), the runner is proven with hand-authored
`CampaignGameResult`s standing in for what `campaignResultOf` would derive from a real game — the same
"between-games" pattern `trors.test.ts` already uses and justifies for the same reason. `campaignResultOf`'s own
reducer is exercised elsewhere (`packages/engine/src/campaign/result.ts`'s tests, and `trors.test.ts` against a
real driven game), not a second time here.

**MC16 QA (step 4d on PR #35), as built: two gaps the Galaxy's Most Wanted walk found.** Both were pinned by
skipped tests in `packages/cards/src/campaigns/gmw.qa.test.ts` and are closed in `@mc/engine`. Neither names a box:

1. **"The main scheme is on stage 1B"** (MC16 p. 8 and p. 14). `gmw.ts` read it as `cardsInPlay({printedId:
   cardId("16061b")})`, but no card record has that id. A main scheme is one record with a `stages` array, and the
   stage in play is `GameState.mainScheme.stageIndex`. The B side is not state: a main scheme in play is always on
   its B side, because advancing resolves the A side and then flips to B (RRG 1.8 "Main Scheme", p. 27). So "stage
   1B" is stage 1. `CampaignGameQuery` gained `mainSchemeStageNumber`, the between-games twin of the in-game
   `ValueSpec` of the same name, which reads the central stage when there are separate game areas. It also gained
   `equals`, alongside `atLeast`/`atMost`. The bonus is now `equals(mainSchemeStageNumber, 1)`. MC21's "if … 1B
   was completed" (`mts.gate.test.ts`) still uses its stage-name `cardsThatEnteredPlay` bridge. That is a different
   fact: RRG p. 27 says a scheme that advances other than by threat is not completed.
2. **Elimination and Victory** (§1 row 22). All nine boxes print it in their expert campaign rules. MC10 p. 17,
   MC16 p. 5, MC21 p. 25, MC27 p. 6, MC32 p. 5, MC40 p. 7, MC45 p. 20, MC50 p. 6 and MC60 p. 9 each say "the
   defeated player does not participate in the Victory steps of that scenario". No box prints the opposite, and none
   prints the rule for a standard campaign. `CampaignDefinition.elimination` (`EliminationPolicy`, §4.6b in
   `campaign.ts`) declares it with its own `whenModes`. **Absent means the eliminated seat participates**, which is
   what every box does outside its expert rules. Under the policy, `campaignResultOf` marks the eliminated seats of
   a won game as `CampaignGameResult.sittingOut` and writes them no `"each"`/`"self"` record. The runner's per-seat
   ops (`forEachSeat`, a per-seat `choose`, an unscoped per-seat write) skip those seats in that game's Victory
   instructions. Shared writes still happen, and `seatCount` still counts every player. The rejoin differs by box.
   Eight print a _paid_ heal in the next setup, which their own setup instructions carry. MC16 p. 5 alone heals
   "to its printed hit point value" at no cost (ruling June 2, 2026 (3) #1: "Heal identity to printed HP at no
   cost"). `rejoinAtPrintedHitPoints: { field }` writes the identity card's printed `hp` into that per-seat field,
   in place of the record the seat did not make. It is traced as its own step under the policy's `id`, after the
   node's Victory instructions. `gmw.ts` declares the policy for `expertCampaign`.

Tests: `packages/engine/src/campaign/new-primitives.test.ts` ("CampaignGameQuery.mainSchemeStageNumber and equals",
"CampaignDefinition.elimination") and the two un-skipped `gmw.qa.test.ts` groups.

**MC10 QA (step 4e on PR #35): `trors.ts` declares the same rule, but the obligation is mandatory, not free.**
**Q19. Is MC10's rejoin free (MC16's reading) or does it cost the printed obligation? Decided by the maintainer,
2026-09-23 (no FFG ruling exists to settle it either way): the obligation is required.** MC10 p. 17 says the
defeated seat "can rejoin their teammates for the next scenario by adding an obligation to their deck during
setup to restore their identity to full hit points" — worded as a price ("by adding …"), unlike MC16 p. 5's plain
"healing their identity to its printed hit point value" with no cost attached (closed by ruling June 2, 2026 (3)
#1, "at no cost"). No ruling addresses MC10 specifically, so each box's own printed wording is read on its own
terms rather than assumed to match its sibling. `EliminationPolicy` gained `rejoinGrant: { from:
CampaignChoiceSource; appendToField?: string }`, run unconditionally (no `optional`) for every seat
`rejoinAtPrintedHitPoints` heals — the general primitive is `CampaignOp` `forEachSeat`'s new `scope?:
"participating" | "sittingOut"` (default `"participating"`, unchanged for every existing box), so a policy's own
synthetic instruction can run _only_ for the seats it is rejoining, the complement of every other per-seat op's
audience. `runner.ts`'s `rejoinInstruction` emits a second, `betweenGames` instruction (`${policy.id}.obligation`)
alongside the existing `record` one, drawing one obligation via a mandatory (non-optional) `random` and granting it
with `permanence: "campaign"` — the same convention `trors.ts`'s own volunteered obligation draw (`obligationSetup`)
already uses, from the same `EXPERT_CAMPAIGN_SET`, appended to the same `obligations` field. `trors.ts` declares
`elimination` with both `rejoinAtPrintedHitPoints: { field: "remainingHp" }` and `rejoinGrant`, gated
`expertCampaign: true` like every other box's rule. Tests: `packages/cards/src/campaigns/trors.qa.test.ts`'s
`'MC10 p. 17 "Elimination and Victory"'` describe block (a sitting-out seat's Victory steps are skipped; it rejoins
with exactly one new obligation and full printed hit points; a standard campaign applies neither; an uneliminated
seat leaves no trace of the rule at all). Fixing this also surfaced a real interaction in the box's own pre-existing
"persistent damage" test: its real, driven Crossbones game naturally loses by both identities being defeated, and
the test's own documented "forced win" override (re-deriving `campaignResultOf` against that finished state with
`outcome` overridden to a win) had left `eliminated: true` on both players — which the newly-wired policy now
(correctly) reads as both seats sitting out and rejoining at full HP, erasing the very persistent damage the test
exists to check. The override now also clears `eliminated`, consistent with the fictional premise it already stood
on (a real win never leaves every seat eliminated).

**Step 4f on PR #35: an obligation drawn from a player deck goes into that player's play area.** MC10 p. 17
("Obligations in Player Decks") and RRG 1.8 "Obligation" (p. 30). Every player-deck draw goes through `drawOne` in
`packages/engine/src/effects.ts`: a drawn obligation is logged `cardDrawn` + `drawnObligationPlaced`, enters the
drawing player's play area faceup and uncontrolled (it is still an encounter card), and is announced as
`cardEntersPlay`. It is placed, not revealed, so no "When Revealed" resolves (none of 04163–04166 prints one). A
counted draw ("draw 3", and the setup draw and mulligan per Q20) counts it as one of the cards; a refill
(`drawUpTo`: the end-of-phase draw, "draw up to your hand size" effects) keeps drawing past it, re-reading hand size
after every card so a drawn Martial Law lowers the target at once. `useAbility` refuses an obligation's ability to any player but the
one whose play area holds it, and constant modifiers on an obligation ("Your hero gets -1 THW") now read "you" as
that player (`modifiers.ts`, `uncontrolledYouOf`). The setup reading is Q20. Tests:
`packages/engine/src/drawn-obligation.test.ts`; the four obligations in
`packages/cards/src/wave2/trors/campaign-cards.test.ts` are now drawn for real.

## 12. Open questions

Each needs the user's decision. My recommendation is stated; none is resolved silently.

**Q1. Is expert campaign independent of expert mode?**
RRG 1.8 p. 29 lists them separately and says campaign mode "_can also be combined with expert mode_". Every rulebook
prints `Expert Campaign Only` instructions separately from "_Remove X (I) and add X (III) for expert mode_". But MC16
p. 8's campaign setup instruction says "_Reveal the Badoon Blitz side scheme (use the reverse side for expert mode)_" —
a _campaign_ instruction reading the _expert mode_ flag. So both flags exist and instructions read either.
**Recommendation:** model them as two independent flags (`modes.expert`, `modes.campaign.expertCampaign`), let
`ModePredicate` gate on either, and have the client default to setting both together with a one-line note. Flag to FFG.

**Q2. PLAN.md §C3 lists Civil War (MC56) as a campaign box with 2 scenarios; it has no campaign mode.**
MC56 p. 3: "_the Civil War expansion does not include five interconnected scenarios and a campaign mode_". It is a
custom-scenario + competitive expansion, and its "2 scenarios" are four preconstructed scenarios plus a builder.
**Recommendation:** remove MC56 from the campaign table; its competitive mode is a separate capability with its own
`competitiveOnly` refusal already in the code. Needs sign-off because it edits the roadmap.
**Resolved (2026-09-25):** done. PLAN.md §C3 no longer lists MC56 and explains why ("Civil War (MC56) is not in this
table", citing MC56 p. 3).

**Q3. Do we build MC60's `kind: "choice"` graph and the `beforeScenarioSetup` / `beforePlayerSetup` windows now?**
MC10 uses neither. Retrofitting them later means changing `CampaignGraph` (a type every box's definition is written
against) and `GameStep` (which `flow.ts` switches on) — precisely the engine change the requirement forbids.
**Recommendation: yes, build both in steps 2–3.** The cost is two union members and two step kinds; the cost of not
doing it is a foundation rewrite when MC60 lands.
**Resolved (2026-09-25):** built. `CampaignGraph` has the `kind: "choice"` member and `CampaignWindow` has
`beforeScenarioSetup` and `beforePlayerSetup` (`packages/engine/src/campaign.ts`), exercised by the synthetic fixture in
`packages/engine/src/campaign.test.ts` ("the synthetic fixture exercises the shapes the first box does not").

**Q4. MC50's hidden evidence in local storage.**
Three cards are drawn at random and never revealed (MC50 p. 5). Single-player local IndexedDB means a determined player
can read them — as they can peek in the paper envelope. **Recommendation:** store the value in `CampaignLog.hidden`,
exclude it from every view model, and accept the same honor system the paper game uses. The alternative (derive it
from a hash of the campaign seed, storing nothing) breaks when the card pool changes under the campaign and would
silently change the mole. Confirm which.
**Decision (the user, 2026-09-25):** the recommendation, plus a client-visible counter. Storage was already built
as recommended (`CampaignLog.hidden` / `LogFieldDef.hidden`, `packages/engine/src/campaign.ts` — no engine change
needed for this decision). Client built (game-client-engineer, 2026-09-25): the Dossier overview and the Briefing
screen both show an envelope — the field's own label, "SEALED · N CARDS", never the identities — reading only the
_count_ off `CampaignLog.hidden` (`packages/client/src/view/campaign-hidden-evidence-model.ts`'s own doc comment on
why that one read is sanctioned). Once revealed it shows the actual cards instead. Generic, not MC50-specific
(MC50 isn't scripted yet — `@mc/cards`'s `campaigns/` only has `gmw`, `mts`, `trors`): any campaign whose
`CampaignDefinition.logFields` declares a `hidden` field gets the envelope; "revealed" is this build's own
convention (documented in that module) of a paired, non-hidden `<id>Revealed` flag field, since a field declared
`hidden` can never un-hide itself at runtime (`packages/engine/src/campaign/log.ts`). Exercised by a synthetic
fixture, `campaign-hidden-evidence-model.test.ts`, the same way `campaign.test.ts`'s own synthetic campaign
exercises shapes the first box doesn't use.

**Q5. Where does a campaign seat's deck live?**
If a seat points at a `DeckId` in `mc-decks`, editing that deck outside the campaign silently changes the campaign's
next scenario. **Recommendation:** the campaign owns a _copy_ (`CampaignSeat.deck: DeckContents`), and the between-
scenario deck-edit step edits the campaign's copy; `history[n].logBefore` keeps the copy as it stood, so a retry
replays the deck the lost game used. The standalone deck in `mc-decks` is the _starting point_ only.
**Resolved (2026-09-25):** built as recommended. `CampaignSeat.deck` is the campaign's own `DeckContents` copy
(`packages/engine/src/campaign.ts`), and grants are written into it (`packages/engine/src/campaign/runner.test.ts`).

**Q6. Retry baseline.**
MC40 p. 7 is the sharpest case: on a retry "_they must choose the same player side scheme … and defeat it in order to
earn its reward, even if they defeated it during a game they lost_". MC16 p. 5's spent units are not refunded, because
they were spent between scenarios (before the node), not during it. **Recommendation:** `retryBaseline: "nodeStart"` —
restore the log to its state when the node's instructions began, keeping only `removeFromCampaign`, in-game
`recordInCampaignLog` writes, and `defeat` instruction writes. Confirm this reading of MC40 p. 7.

**Q7. Where exactly does "after normal setup" sit in RRG Appendix II?** _(Still open; built as recommended.)_
MC10 p. 3 says only "_set up the scenario as per the normal rules of the game. Then, follow that scenario's setup
instructions_". MC50 p. 4 pins the same sentence to "_before players draw their starting hands_". MC10 p. 7's own
setup-keyword instruction is incoherent after the draw. Ruling June 2, 2026 (3) answer 2 says "_Campaign setup finishes
before resolving Collector II's When Revealed damage_", which would put campaign setup _before_ Appendix II step 12 for
MC16 — **this conflicts with MC10 p. 3's "then"**. **Recommendation:** default `afterScenarioSetup` = after Appendix II
step 12, before step **14** (the draw; the sketch said 13, miscounting), and let MC16's definition override the two
affected instructions to `beforeScenarioSetup` with the ruling cited in a comment. Flagged, not silently resolved —
and the reason `beforeScenarioSetup` is built now rather than when MC16 lands: the override has to be available to a
definition without an engine change.

**Q11. A `cardState` log field has no way to be written.** _(Found building step 4.)_
MC50 p. 6's Board Members carry counters **and a face** across scenarios, and `LogValue` has the storage shape for
it — but neither `CampaignGameQuery` (the `record` half) nor `CampaignValue` (the between-games half) can compose
"these counters on this card, on this face". Step 4 **throws** on a write to a `cardState` field rather than guess.
**Recommendation:** add one `CampaignGameQuery` member, `{ kind: "cardStateOf"; cards: readonly CardId[] }`, reading
each named card's counters and current face out of the finished game, when MC50 is scheduled. Not needed for MC10.

**Q8. Do campaign grants count toward the three-copy limit?** **Resolved 2026-09-25: yes.**
MC27 p. 22's Aspect Advantage adds "_the maximum number of copies of that card, by title_" and says they do not count
toward deck size — but says nothing about the copy limit if the deck already holds copies. RRG Appendix I is silent.
The original recommendation was to exclude grants from the by-title copy count.
**Decision (the user, 2026-09-25):** all deckbuilding restrictions still apply. The copies of a title in the deck,
granted plus the player's own, never exceed the card's own deck limit: 3, 1 if unique, or its printed per-deck limit
(and an identity's `maxCopiesPerTitle`). The chosen card must also be legal for that hero, so never another hero's
signature or hero-specific cards. **Sourcing: community.** The reading comes from a BoardGameGeek thread
("Aspect Advantage campaign bonus /Sinister Motives spoilers/", boardgamegeek.com/thread/2853322) that reports it as
FAQ-backed. No such FAQ entry is in RRG 1.8's FAQ section (the Sinister Motives entries cover only The Sinister Six's
overkill and active-counter questions), and none is among the rulings transcribed in
`docs/rulings/marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md` (checked 2026-09-25). Cite the primary ruling in place of the thread if it
turns up.
**As built:** `CAMPAIGN_GRANTS_COUNT_TOWARD_COPY_LIMIT = true`; `grantCard` gained an optional `copies: "maximum"`
that grants `copiesUpToLimit` copies, the title's limit minus the copies the deck already holds (possibly none), so
the grant can never produce an illegal deck; a `collection` choice offers only `cardLegalForIdentity` cards (no
identity-set card, no Team-Up card for other characters, no linked, separate-deck or scenario/campaign/competitive
card, no unique card matching the identity); and `validateDeck` exempts granted copies from the aspect restriction,
because the card comes "from any aspect". Not yet exercised by a box: MC27's definition uses these when it is built.

**Q9. Skirmish mode and `VillainStageRange`.**
RRG p. 29's skirmish mode picks "_any one version of the villain_" and removes the rest. `Scenario.villainStages`
(keyed `standard`/`expert`) cannot express it. Out of scope now. **Recommendation:** `PlayModes.skirmish` carries the
chosen version so that when skirmish is built the change lands in the setup builder, not in the scenario record. No
action needed in C1 beyond keeping the field typed.

**Q10 (informational, not a decision).** Three keyword definitions drifted across these rulebooks and the foundation
does not touch them, but `rules-qa-engineer` should track them: **Permanent** (MC10 p. 2 "cannot leave play" → MC32
p. 3 / MC45 p. 3 "cannot be defeated, leave play, or have any part of its text box blanked, except by card abilities in
the same set"), **Villainous** (MC60 p. 3 rewritten around "uses a basic power", so allies and heroes can have it), and
**Vulnerable** (MC50 p. 3 → MC60 p. 3 adds a first-player tie-break for simultaneous defeat). MC45 p. 3 also relaxes
**Teamwork** from "each minion that shares the keyword activates" (MC32 p. 3) to "the minion that just entered play
activates" — a genuine behavioral change to an implemented keyword.

**Q20. Obligations drawn at setup (opening hand and mulligan). Maintainer decision (2026-09-23), adopting a
community (Reddit) reading of MC10 p. 17 and RRG 1.8 Appendix II steps 14–15; no FFG ruling exists — revisit if FFG
rules on it.** Source: [r/marvelchampionslcg community comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelchampionslcg/comments/zph2j1/comment/j0t7kwq/),
adopted by the maintainer 2026-09-23; not an FFG ruling. RRG 1.8 Appendix II (p. 51) says nothing about obligations;
MC10 p. 17 says "When a player draws an obligation from their deck, they must immediately put that card into play in
their play area. They do not draw a card to replace that obligation." The first build read steps 14 and 15 as
refills (RRG 1.8 "Obligation", p. 30's exception); the decision reads both as counted draws instead:

| Draw                                                           | Obligation drawn   | Replaced?                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opening hand (step 14): a counted draw of hand-size cards      | into the play area | not then; the mulligan's draw up to hand size makes the hand up, even if the player discards nothing |
| Mulligan (step 15): a counted draw of (hand size − hand) cards | into the play area | no: the player ends a card short                                                                     |
| Martial Law (hand size −1) in the opening hand                 | into the play area | the mulligan draws up to the **reduced** hand size, read when the mulligan's draw is computed        |
| End-of-phase draw; "draw up to your hand size" effects         | into the play area | yes, unchanged: refills keep drawing past it (RRG 1.8 p. 30)                                         |

Built in `packages/engine/src/flow.ts` (`executeDrawStartingHands` and `afterMulliganChoice` use `drawCards`; a
player whose opening hand is empty still gets the mulligan's draw). Tests: the "obligations drawn at setup" describe
block in `packages/engine/src/drawn-obligation.test.ts`.
