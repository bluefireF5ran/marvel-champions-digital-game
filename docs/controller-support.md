# Controller support: audit and plan

Status: building (owner answers 2026-10-24). Tracking issue #398. Branch `feature/controller-support`. Follows issue #206, whose first part
(spatial navigation and ring alignment) landed in #207; parts 2 to 6 never did.

## Owner decisions (2026-10-24)

1. **Steam Deck / Steam Input: take what Steam sends.** Steam presents a virtual Xbox pad and its own "Use Nintendo
   layout" option already swaps buttons, so the game never swaps on top of it.
2. **Everywhere else: a "Use Nintendo Switch layout" setting.** On a Nintendo-family pad, buttons act by their printed
   label (A on the right confirms, B at the bottom backs out), as on a Switch. Defaults on; ignored for Xbox and
   PlayStation pads and under Steam.
3. **Remapping is a follow-on.** This pass stores bindings as data and draws the controllers read-only.
4. **Keyboard shortcuts land in this pass.**
5. **Glyphs on the board** for the keyboard and the controller, wherever a shortcut applies, only when a keyboard or
   pad is in use (never for touch). While the mouse is moving the glyphs fold away completely (nothing drawn); when it
   stops they animate open again. A setting turns glyphs off altogether, in the keyboard and controller settings.
6. **Glyph set follows the last input.** On desktop, using the mouse brings the keyboard glyphs back; any controller
   input (a button, the D-pad, a stick wiggle) switches them to the controller's (`view/input-mode.ts`).
7. **Steam Deck system combos stay Steam's.** The guide / Steam button is never bound, and while it is held no other
   button acts in the game, so Steam + X (Guide + X on a pad) opens Steam's on-screen keyboard without also toggling
   the guide. A text field focused with a controller says "Steam + X for the on-screen keyboard" under Steam.
8. **Hold Y to zoom.** A tap on Y inspects the focused card. Holding Y shows the focused card enlarged (the desktop
   hover popover), and moving with the D-pad or stick while Y is held steps the focus with the enlarged card following
   it. Its hint reads "Y Inspect · hold to zoom".
9. **LT and RT are hold-to-shift layers (the owner, 2026-10-24).** Hold LT: A Attack, X Thwart, Y Recover, B Change
   form (Xbox positions; other families use the same positions). Hold RT: A / X / Y / B are the first four abilities
   usable right now on your cards in play, in table order; LB / RB page when there are more. At rest one LT glyph sits
   at the action bar's left end (above it on small screens) and one RT glyph by the play area; while a trigger is held
   the face-button glyphs move onto what they now press (the basic-action buttons for LT, the cards in play for RT,
   with LB / RB by the play area when paging), and return to the base hints on release (the owner, 2026-10-24). Undo and End turn move into the LT
   layer as LT+LB and LT+RB (default picked; End turn always takes two buttons). The first trigger pulled owns the
   layer until it is released. On a Nintendo-layout pad with the Switch layout setting on, layer presses act by the
   printed label (decision 2), not by position: the button labelled A is the one that means A.
   **Picking a target (the owner, 2026-10-26):** while the table asks "Choose a target" or "Who attacks?", and on the
   decision popup's card tiles, every candidate wears its own combo and nothing pages: hold a modifier and press a face
   button, in the order RT+A, RT+B, RT+X, RT+Y, LT+A..Y, RB+A..Y, LB+A..Y (16 in all; a candidate past the sixteenth has
   no combo and stays reachable by focus). A bumper held as a modifier does not also jump zones: its tap fires on
   release, and only if no face button was pressed under it. The keyboard keeps the digits 1-9, paged by the zone keys.
10. **Keyboard is one-handed, left hand by default (the owner, 2026-10-24).** Move WASD, select Space, back Q, inspect E
    (hold to zoom), Z X C V Attack / Thwart / Recover / Change form (the LT layer), 1-4 card abilities (the RT layer; 1-3
    still answer an open choice bar), End turn Shift+Space, Undo Ctrl+Z, zones R up / F down, game log B, guide G,
    Team-Up T, Evidence Shift+E; on a decision popup R Peek, F Expand / Collapse. Arrows, Enter and Esc keep working.
    A "Keyboard hand: Left / Right" setting mirrors it for left-handed mouse players: IJKL, Enter, U, O, M , . /,
    7-0, Shift+Enter, zones P / ;. Glyphs and the Controls screen show the active hand.
11. **View / Select / Create / − reopens the villain phase recap (the owner, 2026-10-24),** the same as the table's
    drawer handle; holding it opens the game log. On a decision popup it stays Peek at table. Keyboard: B / N recap,
    Shift+B / Shift+N log.

## What exists today

- `view/gamepad.ts` maps the Web Gamepad "standard" layout to the same intents the keyboard produces. D-pad moves
  focus spatially, A activates, B backs out, Y inspects, X toggles guide focus, LB / RB page a list.
- `scenes/board/input.ts#bindGamepad` listens on Phaser's gamepad plugin (turned on in `main.ts`). It is bound by the
  shared `FocusRoute` (57 screens), the Board, the choice sheet, Inspect and the setup deal, so the pad already reaches
  every screen that has a focus route.

## What is missing

- **No analog stick and no hold-to-repeat.** The left stick does nothing; holding the D-pad moves once.
- **No detection.** `Gamepad.id` is never read, so nothing knows Xbox from PlayStation from Switch, and there is no
  "controller connected" notice.
- **No glyphs.** Hints are hard-coded text: "Press G (or X on a gamepad)" (`board/guide-mount.ts`,
  `board/tip-mount.ts`), "Cancel · Esc" (`board/targeting-panel.ts`).
- **Board shortcuts are keyboard-only:** T (Team-Up), E (Evidence), Z (Undo), 1 to 3 (answer a small choice bar). No
  pad button reaches End turn, Undo or Pause directly (B with nothing selected opens Pause).
- **Keyboard-only listeners** on the Team-Up splash, the achievement toast (Esc), and the arrow paging in the scenario
  intro, side-story reader, extras viewer and campaign opener.
- **Text fields** (save/sync codes, deck import, deck names, report issue) have no pad path.
- **Pads without the "standard" mapping** are ignored.
- **Desktop app on Linux / Steam Deck is unverified.** Windows Tauri runs WebView2 (Chromium, Gamepad API works).
  Linux Tauri runs WebKitGTK, whose Gamepad API depends on how it was built (libmanette). Inferred, not yet checked
  on a Deck.
- **No Controls screen** and no remapping.

Positional names (Xbox letters; PlayStation and Switch glyphs are drawn at the same positions).

Start as forward, on every screen: a forward button is only pressed while it is ready, so a greyed Pay or a pick that
can't be confirmed yet leaves Start to open Pause. The glyph beside each forward button shows Start.

Keyboard on the board (one-handed, by physical key; the Keyboard hand setting mirrors it onto IJKL): **WASD** move,
**Space** select, **Q** back, **E** inspect, **Z X C V** Attack / Thwart / Recover / Change form, **1-4** abilities,
**Shift+Space** End turn, **Ctrl+Z** Undo, **R / F** previous / next zone, **B** villain recap, **Shift+B** game log, **5** (6 on IJKL) discard pile.

## Detection and glyph families

Read `Gamepad.id` (vendor and product ids) when a pad connects:

| Family                            | Matched by                                                             | Face glyphs                           |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Xbox                              | Microsoft 045e, "xinput", "xbox", Steam virtual pad 28de               | A B X Y, LB RB LT RT, View, Menu      |
| PlayStation                       | Sony 054c, "dualshock", "dualsense"                                    | ✕ ○ □ △, L1 R1 L2 R2, Create, Options |
| Nintendo                          | Nintendo 057e, "pro controller", "joy-con"                             | B A Y X by position, L R ZL ZR, −, +  |
| Handheld (Steam Deck and similar) | Valve 28de / Deck product ids; Steam Input presents a virtual Xbox pad | Xbox glyphs on a handheld diagram     |

Expected for the owner's pads (inferred, to confirm with them): the 8BitDo Ultimate in Switch mode reports as a
Nintendo Pro Controller, and the Ultimate 2 in X-input mode as an Xbox 360 pad. Settings gets **Controller buttons:
Auto / Xbox / PlayStation / Nintendo** for when detection is wrong, plus the confirm/back swap.

All glyphs and controller outlines are drawn by us in Phaser (shapes and letters), no manufacturer artwork.

## Controls screen and remapping

- A **Controls** section in Settings (and Pause), with a drawn controller for the active family (Xbox, PlayStation,
  Switch, handheld). Each button on the drawing is labeled with what it does; a row list beside it is the focusable
  version.
- **Bindings are data from day one:** a table of intent per button index, saved with the settings. The default table is
  the map above.
- **Remapping (PR 2 unless the owner says otherwise):** focus a row, press A, then press the new button; conflicts swap
  the two bindings; "Reset to defaults". Keyboard keys rebind the same way.
- **Back buttons on handhelds** (Deck L4/L5/R4/R5, ROG Ally / Legion Go paddles): browsers do not report them, Steam
  Input or the handheld's own software maps them onto ordinary buttons. If a browser does report extra buttons (index
  16 and up), they show on the Controls screen as "Extra 1, 2…" and can be bound like any other. The Controls screen
  notes that back buttons are set in Steam Input.

## On-screen hints

- Hints follow the last input: pad glyphs after a button press, key caps after a key press, nothing after touch or
  mouse.
- Buttons with a shortcut show its glyph (End turn [RT], Undo [LT], Cancel [B]), and each screen gets a small legend
  strip (A Select · B Back · Y Inspect). The hard-coded "Press G (or X on a gamepad)" and "Cancel · Esc" become glyph
  hints.
- A one-time toast when a pad connects: "🎮 Xbox controller connected · Controls in Settings".

## Platforms

- Web (Chromium, Firefox, Safari): Gamepad API, standard mapping.
- Windows desktop (Tauri, WebView2): same as Chromium.
- Steam Deck / Linux desktop (Tauri, WebKitGTK): verify the Gamepad API first. If WebKitGTK does not expose pads, add
  a small Rust-side bridge (the `gilrs` crate) that forwards button and axis events to the page through a Tauri event,
  feeding the same intent layer.
- Android (Capacitor, Chromium WebView): Gamepad API; Bluetooth pads.
- Text fields: a pad cannot type. On a Deck in Game Mode the Steam keyboard (Steam + X) works; the field shows that
  hint when the last input was a pad.

## Build order (one PR, pushed piece by piece)

1. Input layer: family detection, held-button repeat, left stick with deadzone and repeat, right-stick scroll, pads
   without standard mapping logged and ignored. Unit tests with real `Gamepad.id` strings.
2. Bindings as data, the new board buttons (LB/RB zones, LT Undo, RT End turn, Menu Pause, View log / Peek, R3
   Expand), and pad routes for the keyboard-only screens.
3. Glyph set (four families) and the settings override, last-input tracking, glyph hints and the connect toast.
4. Controls screen with the drawn controllers (read-only, or with remapping per question 2).
5. Keyboard shortcuts on the board.
6. Linux/Deck check, and the `gilrs` bridge if needed.

Testing: unit tests for detection, repeat and the binding table; e2e specs that stub `navigator.getGamepads()` to press
buttons and move sticks; a real-pad check on the owner's two 8BitDo controllers.
