# Design reference: seeing the canvases

## Start here: one PNG per screen

`artifacts/design-screenshots/` (added 2026-09-18 by the owner; regenerate with `pnpm capture:screens`, i.e. `scripts/capture-design-screenshots.mjs`, which needs Playwright and Chrome) holds **one full PNG per design screen**, which beats stitching the overlapping tiles described further down:

- `individual/screens-desktop.dc/NN-sNN.png` — D01–D14 (`01-s01` Title, `02-s02` Scenario select, `03-s03` Hero select, `04-s04` Deck check, `05-s05` Table setup, `06-s06` Setup deal & mulligan, then `s08`–`s14`; `14-14-collection` is Decks & Collection). There is no `s07`.
- `individual/screens-phone.dc/NN-pNN-<name>.png` — P01–P17, named (`04-p04-deck-check`, `12-p12-table-setup`, `16-p16-pause`, …).
- `individual/screens-tablet.dc/NN-tNN-<name>.png` — T01–T08.
- `villain-phase/` — the 2026-10-14 villain phase redesign (D1–D3, T1–T3, P1–P4, S1), static PNGs with no canvas behind them; its `README.md` indexes them. They supersede D11, P09 and L02.
- `board-long-table.dc.png`, `board-phone.dc.png`, `components.dc.png` and the three `screens-*.dc.png` — each whole canvas as one tall image; `manifest.json` lists every capture.

**The `Read` tool shows a PNG as an image.** Worktrees don't carry untracked files, so read these by absolute path from the main checkout. Open the screen you are building _before_ writing layout code, and put your own screenshot beside it at the end.

## The older tile renders

The design canvases in `Marvel Champions game screens/` are `.dc.html` files driven by `support.js`. Nothing in an agent's toolset renders them, which is why past screen work matched the tokens and the widgets but not the _compositions_ — the arrangement, grounds, proportions and hierarchy each screen actually has.

`scripts/render-design-canvases.sh` renders every canvas to PNG tiles in `docs/design-renders/` (gitignored; run the script once per checkout, it takes about a minute and needs Google Chrome). Each tile is a viewport-sized capture (1600 or 2000 px wide, 1200 px tall) at 1100 px steps, so consecutive tiles overlap by 100 px. **The `Read` tool shows a PNG as an image.** Worktrees don't carry the renders, so read them by absolute path from the main checkout.

## Tile index

Section heading → the tile it starts on. A section usually runs into the next tile too.

## How a screen workstream uses this

1. **Look before building.** Read the tiles for every canvas that draws the screen (desktop, tablet _and_ phone). Write down the composition in words in the view-model or layout file's header comment: which grounds (void / ink / paper / parchment / card), how the space is split, what is fixed vs. scrolling, where the one red action sits, what's dashed. That paragraph is the spec the layout function implements; `tokens.ts` already carries the palette, type roles and border weights.
2. **Content comes from `@mc/content`**, never from the mock's placeholder text (see `phase4-screen-gaps.md` §5).
3. **Prove it side by side.** Run the client (Vite from Bash on a free port) and screenshot the built screen at desktop (1440×900), tablet (1024×768 and 768×1024) and phone (390×844) beside the matching tile. Fix what differs in composition, grounds, hierarchy and density. Put the screenshots in the scratchpad and name them in the report — a workstream isn't "landed" until this comparison has been done and the remaining differences are written down.
4. Layout tests still assert no-overlap at those sizes; the screenshot pass is on top of them, not instead of them.
