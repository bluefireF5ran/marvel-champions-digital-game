# Missing card art

Card faces in the pool with no scan, which draw their generated frame instead. Listed on 2026-10-24 from the pool the app
runs (`packages/client/src/content/pool-cards.ts`) against `assets/card-art/`. Every other face in the pool has a scan;
the build's own check is the art test in `packages/client/src/art/bundled-art.test.ts`, and the Vite card-art plugin
(`packages/client/vite-card-art.ts`) warns at build time about any scan a card names that the folder lacks.

**Adding a scan:** drop it in `assets/card-art/bundles/cards/<code>.png` (WebP data at a 900 px long edge, whatever the
extension, as the other files are), and point the card's `image` / `images` at `/bundles/cards/<code>.png` in its
`packages/content/src/data/<set>/cards.ts` (and the set's curation source in `packages/content/scripts/`, if it has one).
A main scheme's stages each need their A and B sides. Send the scans in the PR thread and they will be converted and wired.

**33 cards** are missing art. (The two Civil War main schemes got their scans on 2026-10-24.)
