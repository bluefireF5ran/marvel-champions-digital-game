# Phase 7 working spec: wave 11, the scenarios-and-campaign pass (Fear No Evil)

Pass 1b of `docs/phase7-wave11.md` (its §6.1 placeholder). Section numbers carry an **S** prefix so they never collide
with `docs/phase7-wave11.md` (pass 1a) or `docs/phase7-wave11-hero-packs.md` (pass 2, `H` prefix). The model is
`docs/phase7-wave10.md` (scenario records, primitives, build order) and the MC50 campaign sections of
`docs/phase7-wave9.md` (§2.9, §3.73–§3.78). Wave 1–10 §3 primitives and pass 1a's §3 are assumed. Agents do not edit
statuses or open questions; they report, and the main session flips them.

**Scope.** Fear No Evil's encounter half, 60065–60210, now transcribed from the Hall of Heroes scans into
`packages/content/scripts/marvelcdb/curation/fne-encounter/*.ts` (`villains-a.ts`, `villains-b.ts`, `kingpin.ts`,
`scenarios.ts`, `modular-campaign.ts`) and joined to `curation/fne.ts` as `addedRecords`; card text pointer
`docs/cards/by_pack/fne.md`. Six villain sets, five interchangeable scenario sets, the Kingpin scenario, six modular sets,
five campaign environments and the Typhoid Mary campaign ally. **Data state (2026-10-18):** records transcribed, not yet
emitted (another agent is emitting `fne` now); `fne.ts` has `scenarios: []`.

## S1. Schema and data needs (owner: `game-rules-architect`; data by `card-data-pipeline`)

### S1.1 Scenario records: one per main scheme, the underling villain a setup option

MC60 p. 5: "five of this expansion's scenarios combine one of five interchangeable main schemes with one of the five
interchangeable villains". The rulebook names a scenario by its main scheme ("the Protection Racket scenario", the log's
Scenario column), and step 5 of p. 9 picks the villain _for_ a scenario. So, as wave 10 made the leader the scenario and
the stages options (wave 10 §1.4), **the main scheme is the scenario and the villain is an option**: five records plus
Kingpin, not 25.

| Id                  | Main scheme (set)                   | Villain default | Encounter sets            | Modular (recommended, 2)       | Notes                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `art-museum-heist`  | 60121 (`art_museum_heist`)          | option (§S1.2)  | villain set, scenario set | `cops`, `the_owl`              |                                               |
| `the-getaway`       | 60128 (`the_getaway`)               | option          | villain set, scenario set | `cops`, `drive`                |                                               |
| `protection-racket` | 60134–60138, one per player (§S3.1) | option          | villain set, scenario set | `disasters`, `tracksuit_mafia` | five main scheme cards, one shared printed 1A |
| `the-raft-breakout` | 60142 (`the_raft_breakout`)         | option          | villain set, scenario set | `the_owl`, `tombstone`         |                                               |
| `stop-the-presses`  | 60151 (`stop_the_presses`)          | option          | villain set, scenario set | `tombstone`, `tracksuit_mafia` |                                               |
| `kingpin`           | 60161 → 60162 (`kingpin`)           | 60159 (A1/A2)   | `kingpin`                 | `tombstone`, `tracksuit_mafia` | expert villain 60160 (B1/B2); no Standard set |

Every record: `modularSetCount: 2`; `standardSetCodes: ["standard"]` (core) except Kingpin (`[]`, MC60 p. 23:
"does **not** use the Standard encounter set, but still uses the Expert encounter set in Expert Mode");
`expertSetCodes: ["expert"]`. Kingpin: `villainStages` is the Collector shape (one double-sided card per mode, A1/A2
standard, B1/B2 expert; wave 3 §1.1), `victory: "finalVillainStage"` (defeating the "2" side). Main scheme stages from
the cards: Art Museum Heist 1B base 1[per_hero], target 9[per_hero], escalation X[per_hero] (star, X = 1 + Art
attachments on the villain); The Getaway 2/9/+2 per hero; Protection Racket 0/10/+1 fixed (each); The Raft Breakout
2/11/+1 per hero; Stop the Presses! 1/9/+1 per hero; The King's Gambit 3/11/+1 per hero; Endgame 0/7/+1 per hero.

### S1.2 The underling villain options (new field)

`Scenario.villainOptions?: { readonly options: readonly VillainOption[]; readonly defaultSetId: EncounterSetId }`,
`VillainOption = { villainSetId, villainCardId, villainStages, victory?, expertVillainCardId? }`. The four interchangeable
records carry the same five options (MC60 p. 5); `villainCardId` holds the default's card so every existing reader of
the field still works. Curated as `ScenarioCuration.villainOptionSetCodes` beside `villainSetCode` (the default).

| Set            | Cards       | Standard / expert                 | Setup (MC60 p. 5; the cards)                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bullseye`     | 60065–60075 | I, II / II, III                   | I sets aside Adamantium-Laced Spine (68A); II finds it and attaches it; III finds and reveals Deranged Bloodlust |
| `electro`      | 60076–60085 | I, II / II, III                   | I and II find Electric Charge, attach it, 2[per_hero] charge counters; III adds 3[per_hero]                      |

| `typhoid_mary` | 60110–60120 | 60110b: stage 1 (A) / stage 2 (B) | Disturbed Psyche 60112 and Establish Trust 60113a (both Setup); the villain on a random side (§S3.4)             |

Default `hammerhead` (first of MC60 p. 8's recommended order). Typhoid Mary is one card, 60110b (two sides, Bloody Mary and Typhoid Mary, of two stages A and B; 60111 is its stage 2), so her option carries `villainStages: { standard: [1, 1], expert: [2, 2] }` and `victory: "cardAbility"`
(Disturbed Psyche: "If there are 3 or more tokens here, the players win the game!"); the others the default.

### S1.3 The campaign record

`Campaign { id: "fne", boxCode: "MC60", packCode: "fne", scenarioIds: [the six, in log order: AMH, Getaway, PR, Raft,
STP, Kingpin], campaignSetIds: ["fne_campaign"], logSheetReference: "docs/campaign-modes/log-sheets/mc60_campaign_log.pdf" }`.
`fne_campaign` holds 60205–60209 (environments, faction encounter, `a` Completed / `b` Failed, flipped by no card) and
60210 (ally, faction campaign, `a` Typhoid Mary / `b` Bloody Mary).

### S1.4 Shapes the normalizer must get right (verify while emitting)

1. Typhoid Mary 60110a/b and 60111a/b: each card's two faces print the **same** stage letter (A, or B) with different
   names. One villain card, **60110b** (the emitted id), whose two sides are her two forms and whose stages are 1 (A) and
   2 (B), flipped by Disturbed Psyche; the option's stages are `[1, 1]` standard and `[2, 2]` expert. Not the MaGog A/B
   stage pair and not two versions.
2. Kingpin 60159 (A1/A2) and 60160 (B1/B2): the Collector mode+face shape (`MODE_LABEL_RE`).
3. Protection Racket 60134–60138: five main scheme cards, each a one-stage card (1A shared text, distinct 1B), quantity
   one each.
4. Two-type double-sided cards: Establish Trust 60113a (side scheme) / Mary Walker 60113b (attachment); Out Front 60129a /
   Alongside 60129b (attachments); Public Support 60163a/b (environment, traits Low / High).
5. Printed icons on non-schemes (wave 10 §1.7): crisis on Mystic Incursion, Sinking Ferry, Towering Inferno 60177–60179;
   acceleration on Wanted 60184; amplify on 60073, 60078, 60082, 60095, 60108; hazard on 60180; crisis on 60131, 60189.
6. Keywords: Vulnerable (Purple Man civilians 60101–60104, Cops 60182–60183, Tracksuit 60202–60203), Teamwork (Tracksuit)
   60200–60203, Permanent (60068a/b, 60079, 60113a/b, 60129a/b, 60143), Steady (60159b, 60160b), Stalwart (60159a,
   60160a), Hinder X (60108, 60131, 60180, 60185, 60189), Uses (60080, 60105–60107, 60153–60156, 60164, 60177–60179),
   Victory -1 (60210a/b), Setup (60112, 60113a, 60210a), Peril (60181), Surge, Guard, Patrol, Quickstrike,
   Toughness, Retaliate X, Villainous as printed.

## S2. Setup per scenario (MC60 pp. 5, 13–23; stage 1A Setup text)

Order: RRG 1.8 Appendix II (p. 51) with MC60 p. 9's campaign wrapper (§S5.3). "Check marks" are the scenario's

### S3.1 A main scheme per player (Protection Racket)

- **Text.** 60134a–60138a Setup: "Each player chooses a single Protection Racket main scheme (at random in expert mode),
  places it in their play area, and flips it to its 1B side. Set each unused main scheme aside, out of play." 1B: "If
  any main scheme is completed or any player is eliminated, the players lose the game."
- **Rules.** MC60 p. 13 "Separate Main Schemes": an event played or treachery revealed by a player, and any card in a
  player's play area, that says "the main scheme" means the one in that play area; a card in no player's play area (the
  villain, side schemes, environments) means **all** of them (a crisis icon guards each; an acceleration icon adds to
  each in step 1); "a scheme" (basic thwarts included) is any of them; an acceleration token goes near the villain and
  adds 1 to each. RRG "Play Area" (p. 33): engaged minions and controlled cards are in a player's play area.
- **Exists.** `GameState.extraMainSchemes` (Tower Defense, wave 4 §3.2: each gains threat, feels icons, can be
  completed); `RuleSpec focusedMainScheme { encounterCards: "focused" }` (wave 5 §3.3, one scheme for every card);
  `RuleSpec accelerationTokenDestination`. Separate game areas (Kang) isolate everything and do not fit. Searches that
  found nothing: `perPlayerMainScheme`, `playerMainScheme`, a play area field on `MainSchemeState`.
- **Shape.** `Scenario.mainSchemeChoice?: { kind: "perPlayer"; cardIds; expert: "random" }`; `GameSetupConfig.
  mainSchemeChoice?: { kind: "perPlayer"; cardIds; picks?: Record<PlayerId, CardId> }`; each pick becomes a `MainSchemeState` with `playArea: PlayerId` (the first
  as `mainScheme`, the rest in `extraMainSchemes`), the unpicked cards set aside. One resolver, `mainSchemesFor(state,
  speaker)`, used wherever "the main scheme" is read: a speaker in a player's play area (that player's cards, events and
  treacheries resolved by them, engaged minions) gets that area's scheme; any other gets all. Acceleration tokens go to
  the villain (`accelerationTokenDestination`) and add to each. Completion of any stage is the printed loss; elimination
  is a `stateCheck` → `endGame lost` on the main scheme card.
- **Tests.** Two players, Battle in the Bodega and Hung Out to Dry: an engaged minion's "place 1 threat on the main
  scheme" lands on its player's; a side scheme's acceleration icon adds to both; a basic thwart may target either; one
  completes → loss; one player eliminated → loss. Expert: picks drawn from the seed.

### S3.2 Swap a main scheme with a set-aside one

- **Text.** 60141 "Swap your main scheme with a random set-aside main scheme. Place the threat from the previous scheme
  on the new scheme." FAQ MC60 p. 26: "All cards attached to the previous main scheme are discarded."
- **Exists.** `EffectSpec swapCards` (in-play card ↔ out-of-play card). It does not know `MainSchemeState`.
- **Shape.** `swapCards` gains the main scheme case: the new card takes the old one's `MainSchemeState` slot and
  `playArea`, stage 1B faceup (no 1A Setup, no When Revealed: the text says swap, not reveal), its threat equal to the
  old one's; the old one goes set aside; attachments discarded (the FAQ). Logged `mainSchemeSwapped`.

### S3.3 The underling villain as a scenario option

- **Exists.** `CampaignOp composeVillain` and `CampaignGameStart.villain` (MC60 p. 9 step 5; `runner.ts`), not used by
  any box yet; `CampaignScenarioRef { kind: "composed" }`. The wave 10 builder pattern (`wave10Scenario`).
- **Shape.** §S1.2's field; `wave11Scenario(scenarioId, { villainSetId?, modularSetIds?, mode, ... })` in
  `packages/cards/src/wave11/setup.ts` swaps in the option's villain card, set, stages and victory; `playableScenarioOffer`
  lists the five villains. **Campaign nodes are `fixed`** to the five records, and `composition` runs `composeVillain`;
  the caller passes `start.villain` as `villainSetId`. `composed` stays unused (its doc comment is corrected to say so):
  a fixed record already names the main scheme and sets, and the villain set follows from the option.
- **Tests.** Each of the five villains against Art Museum Heist builds, standard and expert; a sixth set id is refused;
  Typhoid Mary's game is won by three tokens, not by the villain deck.

### S3.4 A villain starting on a random side; toughness on a flipped face

- **Text.** 60112 "Setup: Put the villain into play on a random side (and reveal it)." "Forced Interrupt: When the
  villain phase ends, flip the villain." FAQ MC60 p. 26: when Typhoid Mary (B) flips, "the ability or keyword on her new
  faceup side resolves" (Toughness on 60111a; When Revealed on 60111b).
- **Exists.** `flipVillain` keeps damage (same type, RRG "Flip" p. 20) and `flipCard` reveals the new face (Mojo FAQ,
  wave 6 §3.65). Toughness resolves only on entering play (`applyToughness` from `reveal.ts`).
- **Shape.** (a) Engine interpretation, marked in code: the villain enters at Appendix II step 8 as usual; Disturbed
  Psyche's Setup (step 11) draws a side from the game seed and flips to it **without** a reveal, so step 12c reveals the
  chosen face once (no double When Revealed). (b) A villain face revealed by a flip resolves the toughness keyword like
  an entering character (MC60 p. 26 FAQ; product text where RRG "Toughness" p. 45 is silent on flips).

### S3.5 "Cannot be dealt damage"

- **Text.** 60159a/60160a "Kingpin cannot be dealt damage or have upgrades attached"; 60131 "The villain cannot be dealt
  damage." Out Front 60129a: "When the villain would be dealt any amount of damage, remove that amount of threat …
  instead."
- **Rules.** RRG "'Cannot'" (p. 11) is absolute; RRG and the rulings separate damage dealt from damage taken (January
  26, 2026 R3; March 6, 2026 R1). Damage that cannot be dealt is never dealt, so no "would be dealt" interrupt fires:
  while Jackknifed Tanker Truck is in play Out Front removes no threat.
- **Exists.** `RuleSpec cannotTakeDamage` (taken). Searches that found nothing: `cannotBeDealtDamage`.
- **Shape.** `cannotTakeDamage.stage?: "dealt"`: the damage is dropped before the `dealDamage` interrupt window and
  logged `damageNotDealt`; retaliate and "after … attacked" still fire (an attack was made). `cannotHaveAttachments
  { from: "upgrade" }` covers the second clause.

### S3.6 Boost cards gaining a Boost ability by set

- **Text.** 60097–60099: "Each boost card from the Purple Man encounter set gains: '[star] Boost: After this activation,
  deal this card to yourself as a facedown encounter card.'"
- **Exists.** `RuleSpec gainsAbility { to }` reads cards **in play** only. `dealAsEncounterCard`, `atEndOfActivation`.
- **Shape.** `gainsAbility.to` may name boost cards (`zone: boost`, `fromEncounterSet`), read when a boost card is turned
  faceup; the gained ability is a `boost` ability like a printed one, cancellable by Betty Brant 60154 like any.

### S3.7 Villainous on a player-controlled character

- **Text and rules.** RRG "Villainous" (p. 47): "When a character with the villainous keyword uses a basic power, give
  it a facedown boost card". FAQ MC60 p. 26: Black Cat keeps villainous as an ally.
- **Exists.** `resolve/enemy-activation.ts` gives the card only to a minion's activation (`isMinion` gate).
- **Shape.** A `basicPowerUsing` interrupt for a friendly character with the keyword: a boost card from the encounter
  deck, turned faceup as the power resolves, its icons added to the stat used (THW for a thwart), its Boost ability
  resolved with the controller as "you", discarded after. Amplify does not add to it (§S4.0).

### S3.8 Black Cat: threat on a minion, an ally while it holds 4

- **Text.** 60169: "While there is 4 threat here, treat Black Cat as an ally that takes 2 consequential damage after she
  attacks or thwarts. Hero Action: Spend a [mental] resource → place 1 threat here. If there is 4 threat here, take
  control of Black Cat as an ally."
- **Exists.** `EffectSpec treatAsAlly` (Karma, a lasting effect with a source card), `placeThreat` on schemes, the
  ally limit.
- **Shape.** `placeThreat` accepts a minion target (the threat is a counter on a card, not a scheme's); `treatAsAlly`
  as a constant with `while` on the card itself; the take-control clause is the existing effect. Control returns to no
  one if the threat drops below 4 (the constant lapses); the threat stays.

### S3.9 Treat allies matching a query as minions

- **Text.** 60145 "Treat each ally with threat on it as a [Deceived] minion with a blank text box. Its SCH is equal to
  its base THW and it does not take consequential damage." FAQ MC60 p. 26: when Zemo leaves play they are allies again,
  under their owner's control, and keep the threat.
- **Exists.** `RuleSpec treatHostAsMinion` (on an attachment, its host). Converted 60100 uses it as is.
- **Shape.** `treatAsMinion { cards: TargetQuery, traits, schFromThw: "base" }` on any card, read live; the host form
  becomes `treatAsMinion { cards: host }`. Placing threat on an ally (60145's When Revealed) as in §S3.8.

### S3.10 Encounter minions tucked under a side scheme

- **Text.** 60204 "When Revealed: Discard cards from the top of the encounter deck until a [Tracksuit] minion is
  discarded and tuck that minion here. Forced Response: After a player reveals a [Tracksuit] minion from the encounter
  deck, that player reveals 1 minion tucked here." 60202/60203 When Defeated: "Tuck this card under the Tracksuit Mafia
  side scheme. Otherwise, …".
- **Exists.** `tuckCards` (player cards, villain stages), `discardEncounterUntil`, `revealCard`; RRG "Tuck" (p. 45).
- **Shape.** `tuckCards` from the encounter discard pile and from a defeat (in place of the discard) under an encounter
  card; `revealCard` from `tuckedUnder` (the revealing player chooses which). The side scheme leaving play discards them
  to the encounter discard pile (RRG p. 45).

### S3.11–S3.15 Campaign runner extensions

- **S3.11 Finale not available.** `availableNodeIds` evaluates `available` without the node (`filter(() => …)`), so
  Kingpin would be offered from the first choice. The `finale` node is left out of `available` and reached only through
  `finale.when` (MC60 p. 9 step 4: "If each scenario is either Completed or Failed, the players must choose the Kingpin
  scenario").
- **S3.12 Progress readable.** `CampaignPosition.progress` is not in `CampaignLogView` and no `CampaignValue` reads it.
  Add `CampaignValue { kind: "nodeProgress"; node: string }`; a node's composition copies it into a `working` number
  field the in-game SETUP reads through `ValueSpec campaignLog` (traced like any write).
- **S3.13 Completed nodes as a choice.** `CampaignChoiceSource nodes.filter` gains `"completed"` (MC60 p. 23 expert
  DEFEAT: "choose and flip one to its Failed side"); `markNode as: "failed"` already exists.
- **S3.14 Removal by title.** MC60 p. 9 step 8: "searches their deck for each card whose title is recorded … and removes
  those cards". `withoutRemovedCards` matches by card id; add `removeFromCampaign { byTitle: true }` so every printing
  of a recorded title leaves every deck. A deck left below minimum is the campaign deck editor's existing check.
- **S3.15 Setup ability of a campaign-placed card.** An `inGame` instruction sets aside 60205a–60209a and puts each into
  play on its Completed or Failed face (`putIntoPlay { otherFace, resolveSetup }`; the Failed faces are `flipSide`s, not
  pool cards); their "Setup:" abilities then resolve in the order the first player chooses (MC60 p. 9 step 12; RRG 1.8
  "Simultaneous Resolution", p. 40). The Typhoid Mary ally 60210a has the Setup keyword, not a "Setup:" ability: step 13
  puts it into play itself under the player the players choose, only when its condition holds, and it must not be swept
  in by step 11. `gameAbilityFrames(…, ["setup"])`
  exists for setup-keyword cards at step 11; add `putIntoPlay.resolveSetup: true`. Not a reveal (environments are put
  into play, and flipping or placing one is not revealing: January 26, 2026 R4 (2), April 30, 2026 R3 (3)). E31: one
  instruction per environment places it (`putIntoPlay { otherFace }`), then a last one, `resolveSetups`, resolves the
  Setups of every campaign environment in play, so the first player orders them across the placements; with one, no
  prompt.

| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vulnerable** (sources §7.1)            | RRG 1.8 p. 48: a vulnerable character that would be defeated by damage and become stunned or confused at once "is discarded before the damage is applied and is not considered defeated". MC60 p. 3's "the first player chooses" yields. Already built (`statusAheadOfDamage`); add the comment below at `wouldDiscardAsVulnerable`.                          |
| **Amplify** (sources §7.2)               | RRG 1.8 p. 7: amplify adds only to boost cards turned faceup "during an enemy activation". MC60 p. 4's "while using a basic power" yields. The one box card where they differ is Black Cat as an ally (§S3.7): her boost card gets no amplify icon. Comment at the amplify count in `modifiers.ts`.                                                           |
| **Steady** (sources §7.3)                | No conflict in effect. MC60 p. 3's extra sentence ("remove all status cards of the corresponding type") is what RRG 1.8 already does: a stunned status card resolves as "remove **each** stunned status card from it instead" (Stun, p. 41), a confused one likewise (Confuse, p. 13). Kingpin 60159b/60160b (steady) use the existing keyword. Comment only. |
| Flips are not reveals                    | Public Support's flip and the campaign environments placed on a side resolve no When Revealed (January 26, 2026 R4 (2); April 30, 2026 R3 (3); June 25, 2026 R4 (3)). A villain's flip reveals the new face (MC60 p. 26 FAQ, as the Mojo FAQ); Alongside's When Revealed resolves on the flip because MC60 p. 19 says so; Psionic Slash says "reveal".        |
| Toughness at campaign setup              | A toughness character entering play during campaign setup gains its tough card (April 30, 2026 R3 (2)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Nemesis minion vs. the underling villain | Daredevil's Bullseye 60033 against the Bullseye villain, Jessica Jones's Purple Man 61031 against Purple Man: RRG 1.8 "Unique Icon" (pp. 45–46), already built (wave 10 §3.8: discarded, a facedown card dealt). Only the Kingpin scenario's own text removes the minion from the game instead (60161a, MC60 p. 23).                                          |
| Main schemes in play areas               | "Cards in this play area" includes engaged minions (RRG "Play Area", p. 33); an upgrade "played into this play area" (60137b) is one its controller plays (the same entry).                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Expert player defeated in a won game     | MC60 p. 9: rejoins "by following the Campaign Setup instructions for healing their identity". The owner's MC45/MC50 decision (2026-10-08/09, wave 9 §4.1 Q14 = A) applies: recorded at 0, step 11 heals REC, or the seat sits the scenario out (`defeatedSeatRecordsZero`, `sitOutScenario`).                                                                 |
| "Trust Established?"                     | Victory blocks: "at least 2 threat" on Disturbed Psyche; p. 5: "more threat than damage". The game ends at three tokens, so the two agree in every reachable state; the definition uses the victory text.                                                                                                                                                     |

Code comment for the three conflicts (one each, at the reader named above):
`// MC60 p. 3 (p. 4 for amplify) words <keyword> differently; RRG 1.8 p. <n> governs (CLAUDE.md authority order: the RRG over product text). No FFG ruling reconciles them (rulings file through August 13, 2026).`

Question 202 is not settled by the order because RRG step 13 hands the content of campaign setup to "its associated
rulebook", and this rulebook's sequence places player setup inside it; only this box words it so (searched the other
nine transcriptions for "player setup"). The engine's `beforePlayerSetup` window (step 8) is unaffected either way.

The progress boxes "1", "2" and "Failed" are `position.progress` and `position.resolved` (`progressToFail: 3`); the
Dossier draws them from there.

### S5.2 Graph

`{ kind: "choice", nodes: [amh, getaway, protection, raft, presses, kingpin], progressToFail: 3, finale: { nodeId:
"kingpin", when: and(nodeResolved(each of the five)) }, available: { kind: "and", of: [] } }` (always true; `CampaignPredicate` has no `const`) (with §S3.11). `beforeChoice`, ids
`mc60.choice.<name>`, MC60 p. 9:

1. `playthrough` — once (`when: not(fieldIsSet(playthrough))`): group choice, "first time through" or not; it only says whether 5b applies (Q210 = B).
2. `drawA` — `random` 1 from `excludingTitles(nodes unresolved, const "kingpin")` (steps 1–2).
3. `drawB` — `random` 1 from the same source less `choice(drawA)`.
4. `progress` — `progressNode(choice(drawA))`, `progressNode(choice(drawB))`; `if not(choiceMade(drawB))` a second
   `progressNode(choice(drawA))` (step 3: "If there was only one environment drawn, mark two boxes instead").

Each node's `composition` (step 5): `if fieldIsSet(villain.<node>)` → `composeVillain(field)`; else `if
playthrough` is the first → a group `choose` (`villainMethod`, each time) between the next listed villain (the first unstruck of Hammerhead, Bullseye, Electro, then a group `choose` between Purple Man and
Typhoid Mary while both are unstruck, p. 8 item 4) and a `random` unrecorded villain; else (a later playthrough) `random` from `fieldOptions(unrecordedVillains, unstruckOnly)`;
then `setField villain.<node>`, `strike unrecordedVillains`, `setField checks = nodeProgress(<node>)`. Kingpin's
composition is only the environment and ally set-asides below.

**Tests** (`packages/cards/src/campaigns/fne.test.ts`, `fne.qa.test.ts`): a seeded five-node run where a draw fails a
scenario (three marks) and its Failed environment enters the next game; the one-environment double mark; first
playthrough villain order with the Purple Man / Typhoid Mary choice; a lost standard game progresses nothing, an
expert loss progresses; Kingpin offered only last; expert Kingpin loss flips a Completed node and replays, with none
left the campaign is lost; Typhoid Mary ally enters after "Trust Established?" and stops after "Mary Defeated?"; a
removed Daredevil ally (60039) leaves every deck by title; persistent hit points across two games.

## S7. Task queue (one primitive, one villain, one scenario or one set per task)

At most three agents at once, file sets disjoint. "After N" is a dependency. Each task reports files touched and a
handoff note; the main session verifies and pushes.

**Data (`card-data-pipeline`)**

1. D1 — Emit `fne`'s encounter half and check §S1.4 items 1–6 against the emitted records (in progress elsewhere).
2. D2 — §S1.2 schema field `Scenario.villainOptions` + `ScenarioCuration.villainOptionSetCodes`, validation. After E3's
   shape is agreed (same commit as E3 if one agent).
3. D3 — The six scenario records (§S1.1) and the `fne` campaign record (§S1.3) in `fne.ts`. After D1, D2, E1.

**Engine (`game-rules-architect`), one primitive each**

4. E1 — §S3.1 per-player main schemes (schema `mainSchemeChoice`, setup, `mainSchemesFor`, loss rules).
5. E2 — §S3.2 main scheme swap. After E1.
6. E3 — §S3.3 `wave11Scenario` builder and offer; `CampaignScenarioRef` comment fix. After D2.
7. E4 — §S3.4 random starting side; toughness on a flipped villain face.
8. E5 — §S3.5 `cannotTakeDamage.stage: "dealt"`.
9. E6 — §S3.6 `gainsAbility` to boost cards.
10. E7 — §S3.7 villainous for player-controlled characters.
11. E8 — §S3.8 threat on a minion; `treatAsAlly` as a constant.
12. E9 — §S3.9 `treatAsMinion { cards }`. After E8 (threat on an ally).
13. E10 — §S3.10 encounter minions tucked under a side scheme and revealed from there.
14. E11 — §S3.11 finale excluded from `available`.
15. E12 — §S3.12 `CampaignValue nodeProgress`.
16. E13 — §S3.13 `nodes { filter: "completed" }`.
17. E14 — §S3.14 removal from the campaign by title.
18. E15 — §S3.15 `putIntoPlay.resolveSetup`.
19. E16 — The three §S4.0 code comments (Vulnerable, Amplify, Steady); no behavior change.
20. E17 — Read `HostQualifiers.withoutAttachmentTrait` in `packages/engine/src/attachment-hosts.ts` (`passesQualifiers` and the superlative filter), beside `withoutAttachmentNamed`, with a test (Sports Car skips an enemy that already has a Motorcycle). Found in review 2026-10-18.
21. E18 — Not needed (checked 2026-10-18): an attack that defeats its defending ally already names that ally with `defeated` set; `defenderLeftPlay` is only for a defender gone before damage (RRG 1.8 p. 9 step 5, FAQ #17 p. 63). The failing Hammerhead test stacked a second boost card that was dealt as an Assault instead.
22. E19 — An `attacker` scope on `attacksLoseKeywords` (today `rules.ts` reads only `target`), so Deadly Sai 60070 can say "Bullseye's attacks lose ranged" itself and beat any grant, Out Front 60129a included (RRG 1.8 "Lose", p. 27). Then drop the workaround in `fne/villains/bullseye.ts`. Found in review 2026-10-18.
23. E20 — One Forced Interrupt that replaces either of two events (Traffic Jam 60189: a character with a Vehicle attachment that would add threat to a scheme adds it here instead; one that would remove threat removes it from here instead): an event-kind predicate (`eventKindIs`) so one ability can branch inside `instead`, and a check that `placeThreat` / `removeThreat` carry the acting character as their source. Found while scripting Drive 2026-10-18.
24. E21 — Card-caused activations of several enemies (`enemyAttack(each(...))`, `enemyScheme(each(...))`) resolve minions "in the order of your choice" (RRG 1.8 "Activation", p. 6), as the villain phase's `chooseMinionToActivate` already does, and read `atkBonus` / `schBonus` per enemy (e.g. `ifElse(hasTrait(thatEnemy, AERIAL), 2, 0)`). Then Swoop Down 60194 becomes two effects (villain, then each minion) instead of its fixed three groups. Found in review 2026-10-18; `core/modular/standard.ts` has the same order gap.
25. E22 — `on.encounterCardRevealed` ("when you reveal a card from the encounter deck") hears every reveal, from any origin (`encounterCardRevealing` carries no `from`). Add `revealedFrom(frame)` to that event, then split the ~20 card modules using it into "from the encounter deck" and "any reveal" by their printed text. Failing case: Spider-Ham's I Don't Think So! (30005) cancels a minion revealed from under Tracksuit Mafia's side scheme. Found in review 2026-10-19 (pre-existing).
26. E23 — A "would be given a facedown boost card" interrupt window (Public Support 60163b High side: "remove counters instead"); `on.boostCardGiven` is response-only today. Found while scripting Kingpin 2026-10-19.
27. E24 — A random pick from a player's set-aside nemesis set (Bag of Tricks 60175, When Revealed and Boost): the `setAside` selector has no `random` option (`encounterSetAside` does). Found while scripting Kingpin 2026-10-19.
28. D4 — The ingest parser folds `^d+. ` list lines into the preceding ability, as it does `•` lines (`parse-text.ts` ~1099), so 60128b's "1." / "2." lines stop being separate constants; renames refs on 60128b, aos 50168b, next_evol 40121b, tt 55033a. Found in review 2026-10-19.
29. E27 — A `forEachPlayer` whose order the first player chooses (RRG 1.8 "Each Player", p. 17), generalising the `orderPlayers` choice `dealEncounterCards` already has; then 60206b (each player reveals an attachment) and 60209a (each player takes a Daily Bugle support) use it. Found in review 2026-10-19.
30. E28 — `inEncounterSet` also matches a card's `specificTo.encounterSetId` (the Daily Bugle supports 60153-60156 are support-type and carry only `specificTo`), so `BUGLE_SUPPORT` in `fne/campaign/environments.ts` can name its set. Found in review 2026-10-19.
31. E29 — Audit existing `forEachPlayer` scripts where the order can change the outcome (each player takes from a shared pile) and switch them to `forEachPlayerInChosenOrder` (RRG 1.8 "Each Player", p. 17): `campaigns/gmw.ts` ~742, `wave11/fne/scenarios/the-raft-breakout.ts` ~132, `kingpin.ts` ~272/297, `wave2/trors/zola.ts` ~89/130, `campaigns/next_evol.ts` ~682. Found in review 2026-10-19.
32. E30 — A choice-graph loss policy for Fear No Evil: a lost underling scenario applies its DEFEAT block, keeps the campaign log (marks already drawn stay) and returns to Campaign Setup (`beforeChoice`: two new progress draws, the players re-choose the scenario), instead of restoring the log to the node's start and replaying it (MC60 p. 8 "may be able to be attempted again", every DEFEAT block "Go to 'Campaign Setup' on page 9"). The villain recorded for a scenario must survive the loss (step 5a). Found by the rules expert 2026-10-19.
33. E31 — Campaign Setup step 12: when two or more environments are in play, the first player orders their Setup abilities (RRG 1.8 "Simultaneous Resolution", p. 40); `fne.ts` resolves them in log order today. Found by the rules expert 2026-10-19.
34. C1a — Cap a node's stored progress marks at `progressToFail` (a node at 2 marks drawn alone stores 4), so the Dossier never shows 4.
35. K1 — Client: the campaign rewind sheet (`client/src/view/campaign-rewind-model.ts`, `campaign-log-deltas.ts`) describes a loss as a `nodeStart` restore; add a `keepLog` branch so a lost Fear No Evil scenario shows the kept marks and the return to Campaign Setup (E30). Client step. Done 2026-10-20 (c831aac61).
36. K2 — Client: when Campaign Setup step 8 removes a recorded title and leaves a deck below 40 cards (removal by title reaches every player's deck, e.g. Core Daredevil 01058 when 60039 is recorded; RRG 1.8 "Copy" p. 13), the next game cannot start until that player adds legal cards (MC60 p. 9 step 8: "must add cards to their deck until they satisfy normal deck customization rules"; RRG Appendix I p. 50; same as the Rise of Red Skull FAQ, Zola). Check the campaign deck editor's existing check blocks the start, and that an added card cannot carry a removed title. Rules expert, 2026-10-19. Done 2026-10-20: it already worked; regression test in d07d567e2.
    36a. K3 — Client: a `chooseCards` prompt with `facedown: true` (owner 211B, 2026-10-19) offers `facedownCard` refs; draw a player-card back for each such option and skip the hover popover (`scenes/choice.ts` `refInstanceId` ~2939 returns null for them today; view model `view/choice-source.ts` ~548). Client step. Done 2026-10-20 (d07d567e2).
    36b. N1 — Netcode: a hidden-hand pick (owner 211B) keeps its candidate instance ids in the open frame's `<slot>#offered` binding; any future per-seat state redaction must strip frame bindings as well as hands (`multiplayer-netcode-engineer`). Found in review 2026-10-19.
37. E32 — An encounter card's target among several eligible cards, where the card does not print "choose" ("exhaust a character you control", "discard an upgrade you control", a tie on "the highest-cost card you control"), is selected by the first player: "you control" defines the pool, not the chooser (RRG 1.8 "First Player" p. 19 bullets 1-2; "Ownership and Control" p. 31; "Choose" p. 12 applies only when "choose" is printed; AoS FAQ Thunderbolt Backup 131B, Ronan ruling). About 62 existing encounter-side `chooseTarget` sites over a `controller: "you"` pool default to `you` (e.g. `wave10/cw/modular/hells-kitchen.ts` ~29/66, `secret-avengers.ts` ~74, `wave4/hood/beasty-boys.ts` ~70, `wave1/twc/piledriver.ts` ~192 tie). Sweep them to `chooser: firstPlayer` (or make it the encounter-side default) with a guard test. Settled by the rules expert 2026-10-19; only matters with 2+ players.
38. E33 — A Special that changed nothing still binds `<prefix>.resolved` and announces `abilityResolved` (`effects-frame.ts` ~269, `announceAbilityResolved`), while `<bind>.count` now counts only abilities that changed the game state (RRG 1.8 "Resolve" p. 37; Citywide Crisis ruling). Make both follow the same fingerprint so "each technique resolved this way" (Nebula) and after-resolve triggers agree. Found in review 2026-10-19.
39. E34 — A play interrupt (Spellcasting 57063, Counterspell 09030, any `cardBeingPlayed` cancel) resolves before a non-event card enters play (RRG 1.8 "Initiating Abilities" p. 24 steps 1-7, "Interrupt" p. 24): today `play-card.ts` enters play first, so a cancelled ally's enters-play responses fire. In progress 2026-10-19.
40. E35 — A basic thwart (or any thwart) against a scheme under a plain "Threat cannot be removed from this scheme" rule (Synthezoid 57021) is accepted and removes nothing; `characterCannotRemoveThreat` (`engine/src/rules.ts` ~554) refuses only rules with an `exceptBy` scope. Settled by the rules expert (RRG 1.8 "Target" p. 43; Wasp FAQ p. 61): the scheme is no valid target while the rule is active; a confused hero may still attempt the thwart (p. 13). Done 2026-10-19.
41. E36 — Bare `superlative` ties with no chooser silently take the first card in instance order (`apply-effect.ts` ~1206): Crossfire 24026 `retargetAttack`, `twc/local.ts` `leastThreatVillain` / `mostThreatVillain` (Get Wrecked 07057, Buddy System 07054's boost; its When Revealed prints "Choose" and stays with the revealer). Tie → first player picks (RRG 1.8 "First Player" p. 19); check whether `enemyAttack` / `enemyScheme` on a tied ref acts with both villains. Found in review 2026-10-19.
42. D5 — An offline re-ingest of `next_evol` does not reproduce the committed data: it drops Luck Be a Lady 40041's four constant refs, adds `printedCardId` to 40139b-40143b and drops `randomVillainName: "The Marauders"` from two scenarios. Find which hand edits the curation lacks and move them into `curation/next_evol.ts` so the pack re-emits cleanly (`card-data-pipeline`). Found 2026-10-19.
43. E37 — Owner 2026-10-20 (Sep 22, 2026 ruling): `resolveWhenRevealedOf` / `resolveSpecials` include incite and surge by default when a card resolves another card's When Revealed abilities, players choosing the order among incite, surge and the printed abilities (also on a normal reveal, `reveal.ts` today runs incite, printed, surge in a fixed order); Change of Venue's boost keeps excluding surge (provisional, pending the announced erratum). Callers to review: Moon Knight 57065, Khonshu's Avatar 57068, Mighty Avengers 56076, The Initiative 56081, Teenage Superheroes 57058, Scarlet Witch 58014, Citywide Crisis, A.I.M. Interference boosts; E33's resolved count. Tests: surge cancellation (Spider-Sense) and player-chosen order.
44. E38 — Owner 2026-10-20 (Oct 9, 2026 ruling; wave 6 Q28 revised): Rogue's copied traits (hero identity and events, `gainTraitsOfUntil(..., { whileAttached })`) follow the chosen target and end when it leaves play, not when Touched moves. Tests: Touched moves while the target stays (grant continues); target leaves play (grant ends). Done 2026-10-20 (2de25aed4; the Rogue ally 48012 covered too).
45. QA — Tracksuit Mafia with two tucked minions: revealing the first releases only one (Sep 14, 2026 ruling). Done 2026-10-20 (the test already existed and passes).
46. Public Support (207, provisional A) sent to FFG by the owner on 2026-10-20 (options A full removal, B partial with 1+ counter (built), C even with 0, D other; and whether it is a general rule for optional replacements). Record FFG's answer by date and update `kingpin.ts` 60163b and its tests if it differs.
