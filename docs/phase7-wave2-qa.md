# Phase 7 wave 2 rules-QA pass

`rules-qa-engineer` independent QA pass over wave 2 (cycle 1: `trors`, `toafk`, `ant`, `wsp`, `qsv`, `scw`), building
on a prior interrupted pass whose uncommitted e2e/qa test files this pass reviewed, corrected, and completed. Per
the standing ownership boundary: this pass finds and proves bugs with tests; it does not fix engine or card-script
code. Every finding below cites the printed text and the authority (RRG 1.8 page or a dated post-1.7 ruling) it
was checked against.

## Coverage

### Smoke games (task item 1)

Every wave 2 hero precon and every `trors` scenario now has at least one seeded, headless, full game to a real win
or loss, replayed from its log to a deep-equal final state (`replay(...)` vs. the live session state), with no
stuck `PendingChoice` and no engine-invariant error — except the one proven blocker below.

| Pack    | Hero(es)                        | Scenario(s)                                           | Games                             | File                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `trors` | Hawkeye, Spider-Woman           | Rhino (Core)                                          | 2 solo                            | `trors/e2e.test.ts`                        |
| `trors` | Hawkeye, Spider-Woman           | Crossbones (standard)                                 | 1 setup-only + 1 2-player outcome | `trors/e2e.test.ts`                        |
| `trors` | Spider-Woman, Hawkeye           | Absorbing Man, Taskmaster, Zola, Red Skull (standard) | 4 solo                            | `trors/e2e.test.ts`                        |
| `trors` | Hawkeye                         | Absorbing Man (**expert**)                            | 1 solo                            | `trors/e2e.test.ts`                        |
| `toafk` | Hawkeye; Hawkeye + Spider-Woman | Kang (standard)                                       | 1 solo + **1 2-player**           | `toafk/e2e.test.ts` (new this pass)        |
| `ant`   | Ant-Man                         | Rhino (Core)                                          | 1 solo                            | `ant/e2e.test.ts` (pre-existing, verified) |
| `wsp`   | Wasp                            | Rhino (Core)                                          | 1 solo                            | `wsp/e2e.test.ts` (new this pass)          |
| `qsv`   | Quicksilver                     | Rhino (Core)                                          | 1 solo                            | `qsv/e2e.test.ts` (new this pass)          |
| `scw`   | Scarlet Witch                   | Rhino (Core)                                          | 1 solo                            | `scw/e2e.test.ts` (new this pass)          |

Crossbones (standard, solo, seeds 3001/4001) is the one scenario that does **not** reach an outcome — see Finding 1.
2-player coverage exists for Kang (task's explicit requirement) and for Crossbones; the other four `trors`
scenarios and `ant`/`wsp`/`qsv`/`scw` are solo-only this pass (time budget; flagged under "not checked" below).

### Card text vs. script audits (task item 2)

Full line-by-line `pnpm card` vs. script comparisons, all clean (target, "you" vs. "each player", may/must, timing
word, cost vs. effect, keyword):

- **Ant-Man kit**, all three identity faces + kit (12001a/b/c, 12002–12010, 12020, `ant/kit.ts`) — every form-change
  and Giant/Tiny-gated ability matches printed text exactly.
- **Wasp kit** (13001a/b/c, 13002–13006, `wsp/kit.ts`) — same, including the divided-power (`Wasp Sting`/`Giant
  Help`) and interrupt-timed form-change (`Rapid Growth`) cards.
- **Crossbones' Assault** (04070) and **Hydra Jet-Trooper** (04146) — see Findings below; both audited to the
  point of a minimal, causally-confirmed repro, not just a text read.
- **Marked for Death** (04028) — audited against its own errata (RRG 1.8 p. 66) and the ruling below; both halves
  ("When Revealed" search/tuck and "When Defeated" return-to-hand) now have a passing test.
- **Twisted Reality** (04135, `red-skull.ts`) — its own docblock admits scripting a printed "Forced Interrupt" as a
  `forcedResponse` (RRG's `schemeDefeated` isn't in the engine's interruptible-event list). Re-checked: the effect
  ("deal the first player an encounter card") has nothing to prevent or redirect about the defeat it reacts to, so
  a response produces the same observable outcome a moment later — verified correct, not a bug. Flagged only as a
  "watch" item: if a future card ever wants a genuine Interrupt on the _same_ `schemeDefeated` event to prevent or
  redirect something, the timing gap (interrupt-vs-response priority) would matter then, in a way it doesn't for
  this card today.
- **Kang's stage structure and villain uniqueness across game areas** (`toafk/kang.ts`, `packages/engine/src/
  unique.ts`, `packages/engine/src/resolve/game-areas.ts`) — deep dive (see Finding 3 / "not checked" below): Kang
  (I) (11001) and Kang (III) (11006) print the identical unique title "Kang (The Conqueror)". Re-checked against
  the Jan 26, 2026 ruling ("Kang Titles") and RRG 1.8's own "Unique Icon" text (transcribed verbatim in `unique.ts`):
  the RRG's "cannot enter play" clause enumerates only player cards and non-villain encounter cards, so villains are
  categorically exempt from uniqueness-blocking — confirmed in the engine (`addVillains` never calls
  `matchingCardInPlay`; `duplicateUniqueFrames`'s own area-merge sweep explicitly skips `card.type === "villain"`).
  **No bug** — the design is sound — but see the coverage gap noted below: nothing exercises this with the real
  cards end to end.

### Ruling-tied regression tests (task item 3)

Searched `docs/rulings/marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md` for entries naming or clearly bearing on wave 2 content
(grepped every wave 2 hero/villain/pack name; did not read all 1139 lines end to end — see "not checked").

| Ruling                                                                            | Bears on                                              | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Jan 26, 2026, Ruling 4, answer 6 ("Kang Titles")                                  | Kang (I)/(III) both "Kang (The Conqueror)", `toafk`   | Verified consistent with engine design (see above). No new test added — the existing design has no test exercising the real cards in this exact configuration; noted as a gap, not pinned as a passing regression, since building the real multi-area state was out of this pass's budget.                                                            |
| Feb 28, 2026, Ruling 7, answer 1 ("Marked for Death & Mister Knife Surge Timing") | Marked for Death (04028), `trors`/Hawkeye nemesis set | **New passing test**: `trors/qa.test.ts`, "Marked for Death (04028): When Defeated returns the tucked Mockingbird to hand". The reveal half (search/tuck, including "already in play" — the exact case an older, now-superseded ruling used to block) was already pinned in `hawkeye.test.ts`; nothing covered the defeat/return-to-hand half at all. |

## Findings

**Finding 1 was fixed on 2026-09-21**, the same day it was proven: `04146.boost` now passes `afterCurrentActivation` and `noBoost` through `dsl/effects.ts`'s `enemyAttack`, and its test in `trors/qa.test.ts` is a plain `test` again (cards: 715 passed, no expected fails). The row is kept as the record of what was wrong. No open blocker remains from this pass.

| 1   | **04146 "Hydra Jet-Trooper"** (`hydra_assault` modular set, `trors/red-skull.ts`) | "Quickstrike. [star] Boost: If you are in hero form, the villain attacks you after this activation. Do not deal any boost cards for that attack." | `04146.boost` starts a new villain attack with no `boost: false` and no `after: "currentActivation"`. That new attack's own `giveBoost` step deals it a boost card, which can be the same/another copy of 04146, whose Boost fires again — unbounded recursion, crashing the game (engine's `MAX_STEPS_PER_COMMAND` safety valve fires, `internal_error`). Reproduced deterministically (seeds 3001, 4001 of a plain, non-adversarial solo Crossbones game), and confirmed causal (not merely correlated) by patching only this one ability's effect in a throwaway `EngineDeps` — the patched version finishes the same seed cleanly. | Card's own printed text (the missing clauses); RRG 1.8 "Boost, Boost Icon" p. 11 (villains get a boost card at every activation, no printed exception unless the source says so).

## What could not be checked (time budget)

- **Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch kits**: smoke-tested only (one Rhino solo game each); no line-by-line printed-text
  audit this pass, unlike Ant-Man/Wasp/Hawkeye.
- **Taskmaster, Absorbing Man, Zola, Red Skull**: spot-checked a handful of stage/main-scheme abilities each
  (enough to rule out the same `boost: false`/`after` recursion pattern elsewhere in the pack — confirmed 04146 is
  the _only_ `enemyAttack`/`enemyScheme` usage in all of wave 2 that resolves from inside another activation's own
  `flipBoosts` window; every other usage is from a `whenRevealed`/hero-action/`whenDefeated` context and is not at
  risk of the same recursion) but not a full stage-by-stage text diff the way Crossbones/Kang got.
- **2-player games** for Absorbing Man, Taskmaster, Zola, Red Skull, and for `ant`/`wsp`/`qsv`/`scw`: solo-only
  this pass.
- **Kang expert mode** (11040–11051): unscripted by the pack's own docblock admission; out of scope.
- **Full rulings-doc read**: searched by name (every wave 2 hero/villain), not read start to finish; a ruling that
  bears on a shared keyword (Toughness, Retaliate, boost/star-icon mechanics in general) without naming a wave 2
  card by name could have been missed.
- **Finding 3's own repro**: identified as a gap, not built into a passing/failing test — would need either a long
  driven game or new HP-patching surgery, and the effort budget favored the two confirmed, causally-proven findings
  above over a third partially-built one.

## Test counts

- `pnpm --filter @mc/cards typecheck` — clean.
- `pnpm --filter @mc/cards test` — **714 passed, 1 expected fail** (91 files). The expected fail is Finding 1
  (`trors/qa.test.ts`, `test.fails`).
- `pnpm --filter @mc/engine test` — **754 passed** (62 files), untouched by this pass.

## Files touched this pass

- `packages/cards/src/wave2/trors/qa.test.ts` — corrected Finding 1's diagnosis/citation (was misattributed to
  04070/engine by the interrupted prior pass) and added the new Marked for Death ruling regression.
- `packages/cards/src/wave2/trors/e2e.test.ts` — updated the one comment that repeated the old misdiagnosis.
- `packages/cards/src/wave2/{qsv,scw,toafk,wsp}/e2e.test.ts` — reviewed as-is from the prior pass (unchanged); `ant`
  already had one.
- `docs/phase7-wave2-qa.md` — this report (new).

## Expert campaign HP-restore order (2026-09-26)

The GMW QA pass (`docs/phase7-wave3-qa.md`, commit `a2f89af2`) found that an expert campaign's hard hit-point set ran
after scenario setup's When Revealed damage and erased it (ruling June 2, 2026 (3) #2). `campaigns/trors.ts` uses the
same shape (`setRemainingHitPoints` and the obligation heal at `DEFAULT_CAMPAIGN_WINDOW`), so every Rise of Red Skull
scenario's setup was traced for a source of identity damage before that window:

| Scenario      | Setup (MC10 main scheme 1B)                                                                                                               | Damage at setup?                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Crossbones    | Experimental Weapons deck set beside the main scheme                                                                                      | No                                                                                                            |
| Absorbing Man | Discard to an environment, put it into play (put into play, not revealed; the four environments deal damage only on an undefended attack) | No                                                                                                            |
| Taskmaster    | Captive allies aside; Hydra Patrol put into play                                                                                          | No. Taskmaster (II)/(III) When Revealed only _deals_ encounter cards, which are revealed in the villain phase |
| Zola          | Hydra Prison revealed (allies beneath it, threat); Ultimate Bio-Servant into play                                                         | No                                                                                                            |
| Red Skull     | The Red House put into play; side-scheme deck built                                                                                       | No                                                                                                            |

No villain stage or main scheme in the box deals damage on reveal. The order is moot today, so `trors.ts` is unchanged;
if a later card adds setup damage to one of these scenarios, move the two instructions to `beforeScenarioSetup` as
`gmw.ts` does.
