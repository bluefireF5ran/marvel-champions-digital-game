# Phase 7 wave 3 rules-QA pass

`rules-qa-engineer` independent QA pass over wave 3 (cycle 2: `gmw`, `stld`, `gam`, `drax`, `vnm`, `ron`). Modeled
on `docs/phase7-wave2-qa.md`. Per the standing ownership boundary: this pass finds and proves bugs with tests; it
does not fix engine or card-script code. Every finding cites the printed text and the authority (RRG 1.8 page or a
dated post-1.7 ruling) it was checked against.

**Two checkpoints.** Checkpoint 1 (below, through "Test counts" as it stood) covered items 1/3/4 partially and
flagged items 1's full `gmw` sweep, `stld`/`gam`/`drax`/`vnm` audits, more 2-player/expert games and a rulings
skim as not done. Checkpoint 2 (§"Checkpoint 2" near the bottom) does those: full `stld`/`gam`/`drax`/`vnm`
line-by-line audits, the rest of `gmw` (Groot/Rocket kits, obligations/nemeses, Badoon, Museum, Escape the Museum,
Nebula, every modular set), six more smoke games, and a targeted rulings skim. Read both; the findings summary and
test counts near the bottom are the current totals across both.

## Coverage

### Smoke games (task item 1)

Before this pass, every wave 3 scenario's own `e2e.test.ts`/`*-e2e.test.ts` was Groot (Protection), solo, standard
only — Rocket Raccoon had no game at all, and Escape the Museum and Nebula had none either. This pass adds
`packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/qa.test.ts` (10 new games) and `packages/engine/src/wave3-q1-…`/`…-q4-…` and the Q17 pin (now `regroup-wins-over-collector.test.ts`)
(synthetic engine-level pins, not smoke games — see "Open questions" below).

Every game above asserts a real `GameOutcome` (win or loss, none of the driven games happened to win — the greedy
driver is not a strong player, the same as wave 2's own pass), no stuck `PendingChoice`, and a deep-equal replay of
the session log. None crashed, none produced an `internal_error`.

**Not reached this pass**, flagged rather than assumed clean: `stld`/`gam`/`drax`/`vnm` each still have only the
one pre-existing Rhino-solo game (no game against a `gmw` scenario, no 2-player game, no expert game) — `wave3Scenario`
only carries `GMW_SCENARIOS`; there is no `stld`/`gam`/`drax`/`vnm`-native scenario to seat them against yet (that's
the box's own campaign scenario, not built this wave per docs/phase7-wave3.md's own scope). A multi-player game
mixing `gmw` heroes with `stld`/`gam`/`drax`/`vnm` heroes against a `gmw` villain was not attempted (time budget);
it would be a reasonable follow-up smoke test (nothing in the four hero packs' own kits should be `gmw`-specific,
but that is an assumption, not something this pass checked).

### Card text vs. script audits (task item 2)

**Tooling gap found first, before any audit could lean on it:** `pnpm card`, `pnpm dsl` and `pnpm refs`
(`packages/cards/tools/*.test.ts`) build their lookup registry from `CORE_ABILITIES`/`WAVE1_ABILITIES`/
`WAVE2_ABILITIES` only — none of them imports `WAVE3_ABILITIES`. Every wave 3 ability, including ones fully
scripted and tested, reports `✗ … ← not scripted` from `pnpm card`. Confirmed directly: `MC_CARD=16110 pnpm card`
shows `16110.fanaticism-forced-interrupt` as unscripted, though `gmw/ronan.ts:185` scripts it and
`gmw/ronan.test.ts` exercises it. This is a real gap in the "cheap lookups" the brief and
`docs/phase7-wave3-scripting.md` §1 both point every wave 3 agent at — it makes `pnpm refs`'s own `KNOWN_SKIPPED`
regeneration instructions (`docs/phase7-wave3-scripting.md` §1: "Regenerate `KNOWN_SKIPPED` with `MC_REFS_PACKS=gmw
pnpm refs`") silently useless for telling scripted from unscripted wave 3 refs, and it undercuts this very audit
step (a card-by-card `pnpm card` sweep across six packs was the planned approach; abandoned in favor of manual
`docs/cards/by_pack/*.md` reads once this was found). **Reported, not fixed** (out of this agent's remit — a
`packages/cards/tools/*.ts` change belongs to whichever agent owns the shared dev tooling, most likely
`ability-scripting-engineer` alongside the next pack they touch). Severity: cosmetic/tooling — no player-facing
behavior is wrong, but it is a real drift between the tooling's claim and reality, and it slowed every subsequent
step of this pass.

Given that, the audit fell back to reading `docs/cards/by_pack/{gmw,stld,gam,drax,vnm,ron}.md` (the printed-text
transcription) directly against each pack's own `.ts` source. Spot-checked, all clean (target, "you" vs. "each
player", may/must, timing word, cost vs. effect, keyword):

- **Fanaticism (16110)**, **Single-Minded Fury (16114)**, **Kree Physiology (16115)**, **"You Stand Accused!"
  (16116)** — `gmw/ronan.ts`. All four match the transcribed text exactly, including the Alter-Ego/Hero split on
  16116 and the "already attached" ordering on 16113/16115's own When Revealed bodies.
- **Escape the Museum's "if this stage is completed, the players lose the game"** (16082b/16083b, 1B/2B) —
  `docs/phase7-wave3-scripting.md` §7's own table flagged this as a **known unfixed correctness gap** as of an
  earlier checkpoint ("a real villain phase that reaches stage 1/2's ordinary target threat currently advances
  instead of losing"). Re-checked directly against `packages/content/src/data/gmw/cards.ts`: both stages now carry
  `completionLoses: true` (§3.37, `MainSchemeStage.completionLoses`), and `packages/engine/src/resolve/defeat.ts:114`
  reads it (`if (next === null || mainSchemeStageOf(...).completionLoses === true)`). **This gap is closed** — the
  scripting doc's own table entry describing it as still-open is now stale and should be updated by whoever next
  touches that file.
- **Regroup (`drax` 19032)** and **Collector's discard redirect** — read individually against their printed text,
  both clean (see the Q17 pin below for the _combined_ case, which is genuinely undecided).

**Not exhaustively audited** (time budget, see "what could not be checked"): a full line-by-line sweep of every
`gmw` card (the brief's literal ask — "Audit every hero kit, obligation and nemesis set, and every villain, main
scheme and side scheme in `gmw`") was not completed; this pass spot-checked the highest-risk-looking cards (new
primitives, multi-clause text boxes, "already attached/already has" ordering) rather than every card in the pack.

  Heroes (`04096b`), The Mad Doctor 2B (`04113b`) are all still wired to `on.threatPlaced(query("mainScheme"))`
  (fires on _every_ threat placement on the main scheme, any source, any step) instead of
  `on.villainStepResolved("placeThreat")` (the primitive `docs/phase7-wave3.md` §3.2 built and landed specifically
  for this wording, commit `6ebb61f`). Printed text: Red Skull rulebook (spoiler edition) p. 10, Hunting Down
  Heroes. Authority: RRG 1.8 "Round Overview" p. 4 (step one is a single event per villain phase), "Forced" p. 20.
  Hunting Down Heroes is the worst of the three — its own "Place 1 threat here" branch places threat on itself,
  which re-fires its own Forced Response with the same choice, for as long as that branch keeps getting chosen.
  **Severity: breaks a game** (an unbounded or near-unbounded retrigger loop, in ordinary play, the same shape as
  wave 2's own already-fixed Finding 1 for Hydra Jet-Trooper). Owner: `ability-scripting-engineer`.
  - **Caveat on this test's own construction**, documented in its own docblock: it pins the ability definitions'
    trigger shape (`def.trigger.on.on === "villainStepResolved"`), not a live-driven retrigger. A live repro was
    attempted first (driving Taskmaster's own Hunting Down Heroes scenario with the `firstLegal` picker, which
    always takes a mandatory choice's first option — exactly the "place 1 threat" branch) but the exact interaction
    between the driver, `firstLegal`, and the forced-response chooseOne's own resolution turned out not to pause on
    a `pendingChoice` the way expected in the time available to untangle it; the structural check is unambiguous
    and cheap, and is exactly what needs to change, so it was used instead. Flagged as a live-repro gap under "what
    could not be checked."

## Open questions (task item 4): §4 Q1, Q4, Q12–Q18

Each pinned with a test named for the question, reusing wave 3's own stub scaffolding (`gameAtFirstTurn`,
`stubAbility`, `stubVillain`, etc. — `packages/engine/src/testing/wave3.ts`, `testing/fixtures.ts`) so a later
ruling shows up as one test change.

See "cross-cutting" note below — this is a doc/implementation mismatch, not just an open rules question. | **Yes — flag this one specifically.** Either the docblock's own claim was never re-verified after it was written, or a later engine change (plausibly `8129545`/`06de1d6`'s neighbors, all landing the same week) altered target-iteration order without anyone re-checking this specific claim.

This row cited only "Defeat" (p. 15). The engine now keeps the card in play through its When Defeated and the pin is inverted (docs/phase7-wave3.md §4 Q4).                                          |

**Ranking, most likely wrong first:** Q1 (a doc/code contradiction, not just an unanswered rules question — someone
should read `resolve/apply-effect.ts`'s `each`-target loop and either fix the doc's claim or reorder/batch the
targets), then Q17 (RRG's own general forced-before-optional rule looks like it should apply but the engine's
specific modeling sidesteps it), then Q14 (looks like an oversight in one reveal path, not a considered reading).
Q4, Q13, Q16, Q18 all look like reasonable, low-risk readings as implemented.

**Resolved (2026-09-25):** Q1 and Q14 are closed. Q1's doc/code contradiction was reconciled on 2026-09-23: a
multi-target `dealDamage` is now one simultaneous damage group and a tie is a loss (docs/phase7-wave3.md §4 Q1;
`packages/engine/src/simultaneous-damage.test.ts`, `wave3-q1-simultaneous-defeat.test.ts`). Q14 was fixed in wave 4:
`revealEncounterCard` takes the card out of the deck while it resolves (docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.45;
`packages/engine/src/reveal-self-move.test.ts`). Q13 remains a reading; Q4 was resolved on 2026-09-25 by RRG 1.8 p. 48 (the card leaves play after its When Defeated).

## What came out clean

- Fanaticism, Single-Minded Fury, Kree Physiology, "You Stand Accused!" (`gmw/ronan.ts`) — printed text vs. script,
  exact matches.
- Escape the Museum's `completionLoses` gap (1B/2B) — **re-checked in checkpoint 2 with a real driven test, not
  just a data grep** (checkpoint 1 only confirmed the field's presence): `escape-the-museum.test.ts` now proves a
  stage reaching its target threat the ordinary way loses the game, not just a stage whose last threat is removed.
  `escape-the-museum.ts`'s own module docblock still calls this an open gap and should be corrected.
- Ten `gmw` smoke games from checkpoint 1 (Rocket solo, 2-player Groot+Rocket, four expert-mode games, Escape the
  Museum, Nebula, the `ron` modular inside a real scenario), plus six more from checkpoint 2 (Gamora + Star-Lord
  2p, Drax + Venom 2p, and one expert game each for Star-Lord/Gamora/Drax/Venom) — all sixteen reach a real
  outcome, no stuck choice, replay deep-equal.
- Q4, Q13, Q16 — implemented as documented, low risk.
- The `ron`/Kree Fanatic modular set plays inside a real `gmw` scenario (Brotherhood of Badoon, swapped in for Band
  of Badoon) without incident.
- **Full line-by-line audits, checkpoint 2** (`stld` kit/obligation/nemesis, `gam` kit/obligation/nemesis except the
  one finding below, `drax` kit/obligation/nemesis/pack-cards, `vnm` kit/obligation/nemesis, and the rest of `gmw`:
  Groot kit/obligation/nemesis, Rocket kit/obligation/nemesis, Badoon + Band of Badoon, Museum + Menagerie Medley,
  Escape the Museum, Nebula + Space Pirates + Power Stone, Ship Command, Galactic Artifacts, Badoon Headhunter,
  Ruthless) — every card read against `pnpm card`/`docs/cards/by_pack/*.md`, checked for target, "you" vs. "each
  player", may/must, timing word, cost vs. effect, keyword, and the "already X" ordering pattern. All clean except
  the Waylay finding below.

  confirm each actually loses the game when completed, only confirmed the field is present and the engine reads it
  generically (Escape the Museum's own two now are — see the finding above).
- **The turn-start interrupt window (`06de1d6`) and consequential-damage (`04f0317`) cross-cutting changes** — no
  new earlier-wave regression test added; relied on each change's own landed test file rather than combining with
  an unrelated earlier-wave card.
- **A multiplayer game mixing a `gmw` hero with a `stld`/`gam`/`drax`/`vnm` hero** — not attempted (the checkpoint-2
  2-player games pair two of the four hero packs together, or one hero pack with `gmw`'s own precons, but no game
  seats a `gmw` hero and a `stld`/`gam`/`drax`/`vnm` hero at the same table).
- **The Dec 17, 2025 Ruling 3 "after [enemy] attacks you" / ally-attacked exception** — spot-checked against
  Drax's own Payback (19007, the ruling's own named example): the shared `on.villainAttacks({ againstYou: true })`
  primitive (`playerIs: "controller", usesAttackedPlayer: true`) reads the attack's target player, not a specific
  character, which looks correct for the ruling's own reading, and this is a pre-existing wave 1/2 primitive, not
  something new this wave. Not independently pinned with a new test (an ally being attacked directly, rather than
  defending the villain's attack on the player, needs state the existing `toDeclareDefender` helper doesn't build)
  — flagged as checked-but-not-proven rather than assumed correct.
- **The Apr 30, 2026 Ruling 5 "does a Guard/Patrol engage during cost payment fizzle the effect" reading** —
  several `gmw`/`stld` cards use the "deal yourself 1 facedown encounter card → effect" shape (Daring Escape,
  Library Labyrinth, Universal Weapon, Star-Lord's "What could go wrong?"); whether a minion revealed by that cost
  and engaging the player mid-payment correctly blocks a same-turn attack effect the ruling describes was not
  tested — this is existing, general step-5/step-6 engine sequencing, not wave-3-specific, so it was treated as
  out of scope for a targeted skim rather than exhaustively re-verified.
- **The Aug 3, 2026 Ruling 6 "exactly defeat" definition** — no wave 3 card prints "exactly defeat" (confirmed by
  grepping all six packs' printed-text transcriptions), so nothing in this wave exercises it; not pursued further.

## Test counts

- `pnpm check` (lint, format, typecheck, test, build across every package): **fully green**, both checkpoints.
- `packages/engine` — 123 test files, 1056 tests, all passed.
- `packages/cards` — 141 test files (all passed), 1280 tests (1277 passed, 2 expected fail: the `trors` step-one
  retrigger finding and the Waylay finding, 1 skipped: Q12).
- `packages/content` — 20 files, 461 tests, all passed (untouched by this pass).
- `packages/client` — 134 files, 1624 tests, all passed (untouched by this pass).

## Files touched, checkpoint 1

- `packages/cards/src/wave2/trors/qa.test.ts` — new `test.fails` pinning the still-live step-one retrigger bug
  (Finding 1).
- `packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/qa.test.ts` — new: 10 smoke games (Rocket solo, 2-player, expert mode ×4, Escape
  the Museum, Nebula, the `ron` modular inside a real scenario).
- `packages/cards/src/wave3/drax/qa.test.ts` — new: `test.skip` recording Q12 as genuinely unimplemented.
- `packages/engine/src/wave3-q1-simultaneous-defeat.test.ts` — new: Q1 pin (and the doc/code contradiction finding).
- `packages/engine/src/wave3-q4-minion-leaves-play-order.test.ts` — new: Q4 pin.
- `packages/engine/src/regroup-wins-over-collector.test.ts` (was `wave3-q17-regroup-collector.test.ts`) — new: Q17 pin.
- `docs/phase7-wave3-qa.md` — this report (new).

## Checkpoint 2

Addressed everything checkpoint 1 listed as not checked, in the order the coordinator asked for: full `stld`/
`gam`/`drax`/`vnm` line-by-line audits, the rest of `gmw`, six more smoke games, and a targeted rulings skim. Two
new findings (Waylay, #6; Escape the Museum's stale docblock, #7 — a "clean" result, not a bug) are folded into
the findings/clean sections above rather than repeated here.

### Line-by-line audits

Method: `pnpm card` (fixed mid-pass to see `WAVE3_ABILITIES`, commit `821aa2b`) dumped every card's printed text
next to its script location; each ability's DSL composition was then read against that text for target, "you" vs.
"each player", may/must, the timing word, cost vs. effect, and keywords, watching specifically for an
approximation (a trigger broader than printed) or a half-scripted text box (one clause silently missing) — the two
patterns earlier passes found. `docs/cards/by_pack/*.md` filled in the handful of multi-stage villain/main-scheme
texts `pnpm card`'s own tool doesn't print per-stage.

- **`stld`**: Star-Lord's identity (17001a/b), full kit (17002–17023, 17028–17030), obligation (Banishment,
  17024), nemesis set (Budding Crime Syndicate, Mister Knife, Spartoi Cunning). All clean.
- **`gam`**: Gamora's identity (18001a/b), full kit (18002–18020, 18029–18031), obligation (Unfulfilled Destiny,
  18024), nemesis set (Sibling Rivalry, Nebula the minion, In a Bind, Waylay). Clean except Waylay (Finding 6).
- **`drax`**: Drax's identity (19001a/b), full kit (19002–19018), obligation (Memories of Another Life, 19025),
  nemesis set (Cull the Weak, Yotat the Destroyer, Challenge Accepted, "I Will Destroy You!"), the aspect filler
  cards bundled in the pack ("Bring It!", "Think Fast!", Regroup). All clean.
- **`vnm`**: Venom/Flash Thompson's identity (20001a/b), full kit (20002–20029), obligation (Struggle for Control,
  20023), nemesis set (Klyntar Frenzy, Enraged Symbiote). All clean.
- **`gmw` remainder**: Groot's kit/obligation/nemesis (16002–16028), Rocket Raccoon's kit/obligation/nemesis
  (16029–16057), Brotherhood of Badoon (Drang I–III, Terrestrial Invasion/Protect the Planet, Badoon Ship, Drang's
  Spear, Badoon Engineer, the four side schemes) plus Band of Badoon, Infiltrate the Museum (Collector I–III, The
  Grand Collection, Biogram Image, Inconspicuous Box, View the Cosmos, Stay Awhile) plus Menagerie Medley, Escape
  the Museum (the ∞-face Collector pair, the three-stage main scheme, Library Labyrinth/Museum Ship, the two
  treacheries), Nebula (Nebula I–III, the main scheme, Nebula's Ship, the five Techniques, Lethal Intent, Barrel
  Roll, Combat Ready) plus Space Pirates and the Power Stone, Ship Command, Galactic Artifacts, Badoon Headhunter,
  and Ruthless. All clean; Ronan's own set was already audited in checkpoint 1.

### Six more smoke games

| Pack(s)        | Hero(es)                        | Scenario     | Mode     | Players | Outcome? | File                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `gam` + `stld` | Gamora + Star-Lord (Leadership) | Rhino (Core) | standard | 2       | yes      | `gam/qa.test.ts`                                     |
| `gam`          | Gamora                          | Rhino (Core) | expert   | 1       | yes      | `gam/qa.test.ts`                                     |
| `drax` + `vnm` | Drax + Venom                    | Rhino (Core) | standard | 2       | yes      | `drax/qa.test.ts`                                    |
| `drax`         | Drax                            | Rhino (Core) | expert   | 1       | yes      | `drax/qa.test.ts`                                    |
| `vnm`          | Venom                           | Rhino (Core) | expert   | 1       | yes      | `drax/qa.test.ts` (Venom has no natural home either) |
| `stld`         | Star-Lord (Leadership)          | Rhino (Core) | expert   | 1       | yes      | `stld/qa.test.ts`                                    |

All six reach a real outcome, no stuck `PendingChoice`, replay deep-equal. Cross-pack 2-player pairings (Gamora +
Star-Lord, Drax + Venom) live in whichever pack's folder was more natural, since neither pack "owns" the other.

### Rulings skim

Grepped `marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md` (1139 lines) for every wave 3 hero/villain/pack/keyword name
(35 hits across the file), read each hit's full ruling. Findings folded in above (Waylay, cross-checked against
June 25, 2026 (4) #1's "nemesis sets belong to that identity"). Confirmed already correct, no new test needed:

- **Jan 26, 2026 (3)** — Rocket Raccoon's "Murdered You!" (16029a) reads excess damage dealt, not taken;
  `on.attacks("self", { excessDamage: true })` already does this (matches checkpoint 1's own citation of the same
  ruling for Follow Through). **Superseded (2026-09-25):** RRG 1.8 "Overkill" (p. 31) supersedes it (user decision 2026-09-25; PLAN.md's Overkill note): "excess damage dealt" is now the value
  overkill would spill, damage taken beyond remaining hit points, so an attack whose target takes no excess (a tough
  card, a reduction) no longer triggers "Murdered You!". `resolve/event.ts` `excessDamageOf`.
- **Aug 3, 2026 (4) #4** — Drax retains vengeance counters above 3; `addCounters("vengeance", 1, ..., { upTo: 3 })`
  caps the placement, not the total, so a counter added by another source (Captain Americat, unscripted this
  wave) isn't capped. Already confirmed in the drax-kit.ts audit above.
- **March 19, 2026 (3)** — Power Stone on an eliminated player's identity resolves its "attach to" text rather
  than being discarded; docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.19 already implements this (`eliminatePlayer`'s permanent-card
  handling), pre-existing from checkpoint-1-adjacent engine work, re-confirmed by reading the ruling against the
  spec doc's own citation.

Not chased further (see "what could not be checked" above): the Dec 17, 2025 (3) ally-attacked exception
(spot-checked, not newly pinned), the Apr 30, 2026 (5) Guard/Patrol cost-fizzle reading (generic engine
sequencing, not wave-3-specific), and the Aug 3, 2026 (6) "exactly defeat" definition (no wave 3 card uses the
term).

## Files touched, checkpoint 2

- `packages/cards/src/wave3/gam/gamora-obligation-nemesis.test.ts` — new `it.fails` pinning the Waylay finding
  (Finding 6).
- `packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/escape-the-museum.test.ts` — new passing test proving the `completionLoses`
  docblock is stale (Finding 7).
- `packages/cards/src/wave3/gam/qa.test.ts` — new: Gamora + Star-Lord 2p game, Gamora expert solo.
- `packages/cards/src/wave3/drax/qa.test.ts` — extended: Drax + Venom 2p game, Drax expert solo, Venom expert solo.
- `packages/cards/src/wave3/stld/qa.test.ts` — new: Star-Lord expert solo.
- `docs/phase7-wave3-qa.md` — this report, updated.

## Resolutions

- **Finding 2 (§4 Q1), resolved in `cbc8a10`.** Simultaneous villain defeat and last elimination is a loss. Multi-target
  damage now resolves simultaneously (ruling June 2, 2026 (2) answer 1; FFG ruling May 18, 2023 on The Kraken). The
  Q1 pin was rewritten to expect the loss.
- **Finding 6 (Waylay), resolved.** `18028.when-revealed` now targets the identity titled "Gamora", not the revealer.
  The pin was also invalid: it threw during setup ("no 18028 set aside for p2") before reaching any assertion, which
  `it.fails` counted as the expected failure. It is now a passing test that stages a real 2-player villain phase in
  which P2 is dealt and reveals Waylay, confirmed to fail against the old targeting. The same file's `GAMORA_PLAYER`
  (`ownerOf(named("Gamora"))`) could resolve to Drax's Gamora ally (19020) at another seat, since `named` returns the
  first card in play with that title. It is now `controllerOf` the Gamora identity.
- **Tooling finding, resolved in `821aa2b`.** `pnpm card` reads `WAVE3_ABILITIES`.
- **Lesson for pins:** an `it.fails` test passes on _any_ throw, including a setup error. A pin must be seen failing on
  its assertion (run it once as a plain `it`) before it is committed.

## Checkpoint 3: GMW campaign mode (PR #35 step 4)

QA pass over `packages/cards/src/campaigns/gmw.ts` (`GMW_CAMPAIGN_DEFINITION`), the Market
(`wave3/gmw/market.ts`), Campaign Challenge (`wave3/gmw/campaign-challenge.ts`), and Badoon Headhunter
(`wave3/gmw/badoon-headhunter.ts`). New file: `packages/cards/src/campaigns/gmw.qa.test.ts`.

### Why this pass exists

Until `f7ec234f` ("fix(cards): query([], ...) no longer matches nothing"), `packages/engine/src/select.ts`'s
`explainQuery` treated `TargetQuery.categories: []` as an active (and unsatisfiable) filter, so every
`query([], {printedId})` call in `gmw.ts` — `revealChallengeSideScheme`'s reveal, `headhunterLadder`'s shuffle-ins,
and the Kree Supremacy reveal bridge — silently selected nothing and did nothing. `campaigns/gmw.test.ts` kept
passing throughout, because it only asserts `CampaignLog` values (units, `marketCards`, runner bookkeeping), never
the resulting `GameState`. This pass proves the fix (and everything downstream of it) with real games —
`createGame`/`startGameFromLog`, not synthetic `CampaignGameResult`s — asserting on the actual encounter deck
contents, the actual villain-area instance, and its actual threat.

### Priority 1 results

| Other cards `gmw.ts` moves by printed id — "You Stand Accused!"

A `grep` of `gmw.ts` for `query(`/`printedId` also turned up Pincer Maneuver's `mc16.s5.setup.pincer-maneuver`,
which shares "You Stand Accused!"'s bug (below) rather than the fixed one.

### Bugs found (both fixed 2026-09-23 by `CardSelector atMost`, docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.50)

> **Fixed.** `gmw.ts` now searches with `oneCopyOf(encounterCards(...))`, and both tests below run (no longer
> `it.skip`). Each also checks that the copies not taken stay in the encounter deck or discard pile. The same flaw in
> Zola (II)'s Test Subjects search (`searchAndReveal`, 04123 ×2) and Peter Quill's Element Gun setup (17007 ×2) was
> fixed with them.

1. **"You Stand Accused!" (16116) is dealt three times, not once.** `16116` has `quantityInSet: 3`
   (`packages/content/src/data/gmw/cards.ts`). `mc16.s5.setup.you-stand-accused`'s
   `selectCards("accused", encounterCards(["deck", "discard"], { printedId: YOU_STAND_ACCUSED }))` matches every
   copy — `CardSelector`'s `encounter` variant has no "at most N matches" concept, only `top` (a _positional_
   deck-top limiter that does nothing useful across "deck and discard" together, spec.ts's own docstring). MC16
   p. 18 prints "search … for **one copy** … then deal **that card**" — singular. Confirmed live: the recorded
   Power Stone controller's `dealtEncounter` held three separate `16116` instances. Test:
   `gmw.qa.test.ts`'s `it.skip("a recorded Power Stone controller is dealt exactly one copy of the treachery
   (MC16 p. 18)")`.
2. **Pincer Maneuver (16112) is revealed twice, not once — the more consequential twin of the same bug.** `16112`
   also has `quantityInSet: 2`; the same `selectCards`/`printedId` shape in `mc16.s5.setup.pincer-maneuver` matches
   both copies, and `revealCard(chosen("pincer"), firstPlayer)` reveals both. Confirmed live: Ronan's setup ends
   with **two** separate Pincer Maneuver side schemes in the villain area, each independently placed with the full
   "3 minus Evasion Counters" threat MC16 p. 18 describes for _the_ (singular) scheme — doubling both the total
   threat obligation and the "First Player Action: exhaust the Milano" scheme's real board presence at every
   Ronan game. Test: `gmw.qa.test.ts`'s `it.skip("only one Pincer Maneuver side scheme is revealed and placed
   (MC16 p. 18)")`.

Both bugs share one root cause: `CardSelector`'s `encounter`/`scenarioDeck`/`separateDeck` variants (spec.ts) have
no "select at most N of the matches" primitive, only `top` (positional, single-zone). Filed for `game-rules-
architect` (if the fix belongs in the `CardSelector` shape itself) and `ability-scripting-engineer` (if `gmw.ts`
should instead be rewritten against an existing primitive, e.g. a deterministic "first match" reducer) — which
owns the fix isn't resolved yet, so both are named rather than guessing.

### A design note surfaced while writing these tests (not a bug)

`applyCampaignResult`'s synthetic-record technique (`trors.qa.test.ts`'s own documented shortcut, reused here) has
a sharp edge worth recording for future campaign QA: a `record`-kind victory instruction with no matching entry in
`CampaignGameResult.records` is skipped outright, but a **`betweenGames`-kind** victory instruction (e.g. MC16
p. 10's Collection bonus, `mc16.s2.victory.collection-bonus`) is _not_ gated by `records` at all and evaluates its
`CampaignValue` combinators for real against whatever the working log actually holds. Since The Collection starts
empty, "1[per_hero] or fewer" is vacuously true, so winning Infiltrate the Museum synthetically (with no override)
still awards 1 real unit per seat — which in turn makes every later scenario's own Market/heal offers real
questions that a script must answer, not skip. `gmw.qa.test.ts`'s `declineMarketAndHeal` helper exists because of
this; a QA test that assumes "no override ⇒ no side effect" for _every_ victory instruction will intermittently
throw ("no scripted answer for …") depending on which instructions a scenario happens to print.

### What this pass did not test

- Every other value the "You Stand Accused!"/Pincer Maneuver bugs interact with downstream (e.g., whether a
  doubled Pincer Maneuver breaks the "First Player Action: exhaust the Milano" scheme text, or whether a
  triple-dealt "You Stand Accused!" can be played/discarded three times) — out of scope once the root selector bug
  was identified; re-test once fixed.

## Checkpoint 4: GMW campaign walks, Market visits, loss/retry, Expert mechanics, log-fed setups (PR #35 step 4c)

The second pass Checkpoint 3 flagged as thin: a full standard/expert campaign walk with real games at every node,
Victory-unit boundaries, the Market across visits, loss/retry, Expert-only mechanics, and the log fields (Power
Stone, evasion counters, Galactic Artifacts) that feed a later scenario's setup. All six items below are now

### Bugs and gaps found this checkpoint

1. **`gmw.ts`'s "main scheme is on stage 1B" bonus is dead code in every real game (content bug).** `TERRESTRIAL_INVASION_1B = cardId("16061b")` (scenario 1) and `ART_OF_EVASION_1B = cardId("16091b")` (Nebula) name `CardId`s that do not exist anywhere in `WAVE3_CARDS` — `packages/content/src/data/gmw/cards.ts` models each of these main schemes as _one_ card record (`16061a`, `16091a`) with a `stages` array; a stage's A/B face text lives in that stage's own `text`/`aSide` fields, never as a second top-level `cardId()`. Which face is showing is `CardInstance.flipped`, not a different `instance.cardId`. Since `TargetQuery.printedId` matches `instance.cardId` directly (`select.ts:343`), `atLeast(cardsInPlay({categories:["mainScheme"], printedId: TERRESTRIAL_INVASION_1B}), 1)` can never be true — MC16 p. 8's and p. 14's "1 unit if the main scheme is on stage 1B" bonuses always award 0, in every real game, standard or expert. Test: `gmw.qa.test.ts`'s `it.skip("met: the main scheme is actually on stage 1B (Terrestrial Invasion) awards the bonus — ENGINE/CONTENT GAP")`. Owner: `game-rules-architect` (a `TargetQuery` that can read stage identity/`flipped` needs to exist first) then `ability-scripting-engineer` (rewrite `gmw.ts` against it). **Not fixed** — the fix needs a new query shape, not a one-line content edit. **Fixed since:** `CampaignGameQuery` `mainSchemeStageNumber` + `equals` (design §11, "MC16 QA (step 4d)"); both bonuses are `equals(mainSchemeStageNumber, 1)` and the test runs as `"met: the main scheme is still on stage 1B …"` plus a stage-2 miss.
2. **The Collection's "choose 1 card from hand" (RRG 1.8 p. 67 errata) — diagnosed, not a bug.** Driving a real, 2-seat Infiltrate the Museum game (expert campaign) to its first player-phase pause found **4** cards in `state.scenarioAreas["The Collection"]`, not the 2 (1 per seat) `mc16.s2.setup.collection` alone should ever add, and neither seat's hand had shrunk from a hardcoded expectation of 4. Tracing every `cardMoved` event into the area shows the instruction itself fires exactly once per seat, each moving the one card `chooseCards` bound from that seat's own hand — the missing baseline was Infiltrate the Museum's own main scheme, The Grand Collection 1A, whose printed `Setup: Create "The Collection" game area. Put the top card of each player's deck faceup into The Collection` (`packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/museum.ts`'s `16073a.setup`) runs earlier, at `resolveScenarioSetup`, and already seeds the area with 1 card per seat from the deck — a second, independent, and correct source into the same shared area, not the Collector's discard redirect (nothing discards during setup) and not a double-fire. A 2-seat expert game legitimately ends setup with 4 cards in The Collection (2 from the main scheme's own setup, 2 from this instruction); the "hand unchanged at 5" was likewise measured against a hardcoded absolute (4) rather than each seat's own actual post-mulligan hand size (6). Test: `gmw.qa.test.ts`'s `describe('RRG 1.8 p. 67 errata "When setup ends" — The Collection's hand-card choice')`, now driving the real game and asserting the instruction's own delta (one hand-to-Collection `cardMoved` per seat, in seat order, hand length down by exactly 1) rather than an absolute count. No code change was needed in `gmw.ts`/`museum.ts`; the earlier report's own assertions were the bug.
3. **MC16 p. 5 "Elimination and Victory" is not implemented at the engine level (confirmed engine gap, not new this checkpoint but now proven with a real staged game).** `packages/engine/src/campaign/result.ts`'s `seatsFor` — the function deciding which seats a `record` instruction's `"each"`/`"self"` write applies to — reads only `state.campaign?.seats`; it never consults `PlayerState.eliminated` (`state.ts:175`). A player defeated mid-scenario in a game the team still wins is handed every "each" Victory write exactly like a seat that survived the whole game, the opposite of MC16 p. 5's "does not participate in the Victory steps of that scenario." Ruling June 2, 2026 (3) #1 additionally specifies the healing half explicitly ("Heal identity to printed HP at no cost" for a player defeated in Brotherhood of Badoon, entering Infiltrate the Museum) — a rule `hpSetSetup`'s plain `remainingHitPointsCappedAtBase` read cannot express either, since a defeated identity's own "remaining HP" from that lost attempt is not what the next scenario should read at all. Test: `gmw.qa.test.ts`'s `describe.skip('MC16 p. 5 "Elimination and Victory" — a defeated player skips this scenario's Victory steps (ENGINE GAP)')`. Owner: `game-rules-architect`. **Fixed since:** `CampaignDefinition.elimination` (design §11, "MC16 QA (step 4d)"), declared by `gmw.ts` for expert campaigns with the free rejoin at printed HP; the group runs un-skipped with three tests.

### Rulings checked

- **June 2, 2026 (3)**: all four sub-answers read against `gmw.ts`/the engine. #1 (heal to printed HP at no cost for
  a player defeated in a won scenario) is the uncovered half of Finding 3 above. #2 (campaign setup finishes before
  Collector II's own When Revealed damage) — not independently tested this checkpoint (would need a full Escape the
  Museum setup-into-play drive; flagged, not verified). #3 (multiple copies of the same title in The Collection are
  recorded individually) is consistent with `collection`'s field being a plain `cardList` `append` with no
  title-dedup, but not proven with a live 2-copies-of-one-title case (the Collection hand-choice discrepancy,
  Finding 2, made staging that scenario unreliable this checkpoint). #4 (Escape the Museum removes a _count_ of
  cards from The Collection, not necessarily the exact same instances) matches `gmw.ts`'s own
  `moveCards(campaignLogCards("collection"), "removedFromGame")` reading, not independently re-verified for the
  duplicate-title edge case.

### Files touched, Checkpoint 4

- `packages/cards/src/campaigns/gmw.qa.test.ts` — extended: 6 new `describe` groups (one per item above), ~50 new
  tests. Originally 3 `it.skip`/`describe.skip` findings (stage-1B dead bonus, the Collection discrepancy, the
  elimination gap); all three are now un-skipped (see "Fixed since" notes above and step 4d's own diagnosis of the
  Collection finding).
- `docs/phase7-wave3-qa.md` — this section.

### What this pass did not test

- The full MC16 end-to-end campaign walk with **real, engine-driven** wins at every one of the 5 nodes (this
  checkpoint's own Item 1 drives real games at every node for _setup inspection_, but still advances between nodes
  with a synthetic `winNode`/`applyWin`, the same documented shortcut `trors.qa.test.ts` uses — a genuine,
  engine-recognized win chained across all 5 nodes, the way `trors.qa.test.ts`'s own Crossbones test does for one
  node, was not attempted for all 5 GMW scenarios this pass; time budget).
- Ruling June 2, 2026 (3) #2 and #3 (see "Rulings checked" above) — read against the code, not independently driven.
- Every other value the Collection-choice discrepancy (Finding 2) might also be corrupting (e.g., whether the
  quadrupled Collection area then breaks scenario 3's own `mc16.s3.setup.collection-remove` "search deck/discard/hand
  for each card recorded" instruction) — out of scope once the discrepancy itself couldn't be diagnosed confidently.

## Full QA pass (2026-09-25)

Scope: PR #45 (`feature/wave-4`), the full `gmw` box (heroes, obligations/nemeses, all five scenarios and their
modulars, and the `GMW_CAMPAIGN_DEFINITION` campaign, expert campaign rules, campaign log and carried state) — the
task brief's own scope for this pass. Started from `docs/phase7-wave3.md`/`docs/phase7-wave4.md`'s already-answered
questions and PR #61 (`origin/claude/outstanding-questions`, unmerged) fix list, neither of which is re-litigated
here. Per-checkpoint findings above already cover a full line-by-line card audit, sixteen-plus smoke games, and four
checkpoints of campaign-mode QA (Priority 1/2 items, a full standard+expert node-by-node walk, Market/loss/retry,
expert mechanics, and log-fed setups); this pass's own job was to find what those checkpoints explicitly flagged as
**not** checked and either close it or file it.

### Verified, not re-litigated

- **`start.encounterSets` (composed campaign sets) reaching a client-launched campaign game** — the task brief's own
  callout. The bug (`campaignLaunchConfig` dropping `CampaignGameStart.encounterSets`) and its fix are already
  merged into `feature/wave-4` as commit `50dd9bd0`, with its own regression tests in
  `packages/client/src/campaign/dev-fixtures.test.ts` (`"a client-launched campaign game actually contains its
  composed encounter-set cards"`, `"...replays the same composed encounter-set cards"`) covering both MTS and a
  GMW case (Brotherhood of Badoon's Badoon Blitz Campaign Challenge side scheme). Confirmed still green
  (`pnpm --filter @mc/client test` — 186 files, 2175 tests, all pass) and confirmed the fix is generic (client-side
  `SessionConfig.campaignEncounterSets` plumbing, not scenario-specific), so it covers `gmw`'s other four scenarios
  too even though only one is asserted by name. Not independently re-proven per-scenario at the client layer — that
  would be `game-client-engineer`'s regression suite to extend, not a rules-QA gap (the engine-level composition
  itself, for every scenario including the ones the client test doesn't name, is already proven in
  `packages/cards/src/campaigns/gmw.qa.test.ts`'s Priority 1 describe, which builds real `GameState`s directly and
  is unaffected by the client bug).
- **The five other `completionLoses: true` stages** flagged as not individually driven (checkpoint 4's "what could
  not be checked"). Re-checked directly against `packages/content/src/data/gmw/cards.ts`: of the seven
  `completionLoses: true` occurrences, only two (Escape the Museum's 1B `16082b`/2B `16083b`, both already proven
  live by `escape-the-museum.test.ts`) are on a _non-final_ stage where the field actually changes behavior
  (`resolve/defeat.ts`'s `completeMainScheme`: a final stage already loses via `next === null` regardless of the
  field). The other five (`16062b` Protect the Planet, `16073b` The Grand Collection, `16084b` The Great Escape,
  `16092b` Warp Drive Initiated, `16107b` "Take What Is Mine") are each their own main scheme's _final_ stage, so
  the flag is a harmless duplicate of the engine's own default final-stage-loses rule (RRG 1.8 "Main Scheme" p. 27),
  not a distinct code path needing its own test. No bug, no new test needed — the checkpoint's caution here was
  warranted to raise but the underlying risk doesn't exist.

### Finding: campaign HP restore ran after Collector II's damage, silently erasing it

**`gmw` expert campaign, `mc16.s2.setup.hp-set`/`mc16.s2.setup.heal-effect` (and the same-shaped instructions at s3/
s4/s5) — fixed.**

- **Printed text:** MC16 p. 10/p. 12/p. 14/p. 18, "Expert Campaign Only: Set each player's hit points to their
  remaining hit point value recorded in the campaign log for the previous scenario," and the paired heal
  ("...heal their identity to its printed hit point value"). Infiltrate the Museum's own Collector (II) (expert
  mode face, `16071`): "When Revealed: In player order, each player must choose to either put the top card of their
  deck faceup into The Collection or take 3 damage."
- **Authority:** ruling June 2, 2026 (3) #2 (`marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md`): "Campaign setup finishes
  **before** resolving Collector II's When Revealed damage." `packages/engine/src/campaign.ts`'s own `CampaignWindow`
  docblock had already flagged this exact ruling as an open design question ("a box may override the affected
  instructions to `beforeScenarioSetup`") — the override was never made.
- **What the code did:** `hpSetSetup`/the heal-effect instruction both used `DEFAULT_CAMPAIGN_WINDOW`
  (`"afterScenarioSetup"`), which per `CAMPAIGN_WINDOW_ORDER` runs _after_ `resolveScenarioSetup` (the villain reveal
  and its When Revealed abilities, RRG 1.8 Appendix II step 12). Since `setRemainingHitPoints` is a hard, absolute
  set of the identity's damage (`resolve/apply-effect.ts`), running it after Collector II's own damage silently
  overwrote — erased — whatever damage Collector II had just dealt, rather than the ruling's intended order (restore
  HP, _then_ Collector II's damage lands on top of the correct total).
- **Test:** `packages/cards/src/campaigns/gmw.qa.test.ts`, describe `"ruling June 2, 2026 (3) #2 — campaign setup
  (HP restore) finishes before Collector II's own When Revealed damage"` — a real 1-seat expert-campaign game (both
  `expertCampaign: true` and game-mode `expert: true`, since Collector II is the _game-mode_ expert face) that wins
  Brotherhood of Badoon with a recorded low `remainingHp`, enters Infiltrate the Museum, and drives Collector II's
  own When Revealed choice to "Take 3 damage" with a custom `Picker`. Confirmed failing before the fix (received
  `max - recordedHp`, i.e. Collector's 3 damage vanished) and passing after (received `max - recordedHp + 3`).
- **Fix:** `packages/cards/src/campaigns/gmw.ts` — both instructions now use `window: "beforeScenarioSetup"` instead
  of the default, with a comment citing the ruling and confirming (per `setup.ts`) that every player identity
  already exists in `GameState.instances` by that window, so restoring HP there is safe.
- **Severity:** real (a rational expert-campaign player choosing "take 3 damage" from Collector II, believing it
  costs them HP, got it for free — the choice was a no-op against the eventual recorded value) but narrow (only
  Infiltrate the Museum's Collector II reads the timing at all; every other scenario's own setup has no in-setup
  damage source for this ordering to matter to).
- **Commit:** (this pass's commit, see `git log` on `feature/wave-4` for the SHA — `packages/cards/src/campaigns/
  gmw.ts` + `packages/cards/src/campaigns/gmw.qa.test.ts`); changie fragment `Fixed-20260926-000042.yaml`.
- **Not fixed, flagged instead:** `packages/cards/src/campaigns/trors.ts` and `packages/cards/src/campaigns/mts.ts`
  use the identical `setRemainingHitPoints(campaignLogValue("remainingHp", ...), ...)` shape at
  `DEFAULT_CAMPAIGN_WINDOW` too (`trors.ts:240`/`:754`, `mts.ts:145`). Neither box's own rulebook is confirmed to
  print a same-shaped "damage dealt during setup" card the way MC16's Collector II does, so this pass did not treat
  either as a proven bug — but the same window default is present, and whichever agent next touches those files
  should check for a setup-phase damage source before assuming the default window is safe there too. `trors` is wave
  2 (out of this pass's scope) and `mts` is another QA agent's wave 4 pass (explicitly out of bounds per this task's
  brief); flagged here rather than touched.

### What this pass did not get to

- A live-driven repro of the `trors` step-one retrigger bug (Finding 1, still open from checkpoint 1) — unchanged,
  still not attempted; out of this pass's `gmw`-only scope in any case (the bug lives in `wave2/trors`).
- Independent verification that `trors.ts`/`mts.ts` have the same Collector-II-shaped bug (see above) — flagged, not
  investigated further (out of scope: `trors` is wave 2, `mts` is the parallel wave 4 QA agent's box).
- A per-scenario (not just Brotherhood of Badoon) client-layer regression test for `start.encounterSets` on
  Infiltrate the Museum/Escape the Museum/Nebula/Ronan the Accuser — the underlying fix is generic and already
  covered at the engine layer for every scenario, so this is a nice-to-have for `game-client-engineer`'s own suite,
  not a rules gap.

## Coordinator follow-up (2026-09-26): six independent items, not trusting checkpoints 1-4 wholesale

The coordinator read the Collector II finding above, agreed it was real, but pushed back on treating checkpoints
1-4's "all clean" line-by-line audits as settled — asked for six specific, independently-driven items. Each is its
own subsection below with what was checked, what was found, and what was fixed.

### 1. Per-scenario client launch: `start.encounterSets` for all five scenarios

Extended `packages/client/src/campaign/dev-fixtures.test.ts`'s own `"a client-launched campaign game actually
contains its composed encounter-set cards"` describe (previously only Brotherhood of Badoon) with one test per
remaining scenario, each composing the real next node and launching it through a real `EngineSessionCore`:

- Infiltrate the Museum: "Gallery of Splendor" (its own Campaign Challenge side scheme) in play.
- Escape the Museum: `"There is No Escape"` in play.
- Nebula: "Guerrilla Tactics" in play.
- Ronan the Accuser: the Badoon Headhunter minion (16183) present — Ronan prints no Campaign Challenge side scheme
  of its own, so this exercises the same `start.encounterSets` plumbing via a different card instead.

Needed a small `dev-fixtures.ts` addition: `GmwRunStop` gained `"afterIssue4"` (won Nebula, ready to compose Ronan
— the type only went as far as `"afterIssue3"`), and a new exported `seedGmwComposed` helper that composes a
record's next node for real (via the same `gmwAutoAnswer` policy `seedGmwRun` itself uses) without fabricating a
win, since the existing `seedGmwWonGame` always plays the composed game to a substituted win rather than returning
the composed record alone. All four new tests passed on the first real run — no bug found here; the client fix
(`50dd9bd0`, already on `feature/wave-4` before this pass started) is generic and reaches every scenario, not just
the one the original regression test happened to name. Test: `packages/client/src/campaign/dev-fixtures.test.ts`.
Commit: `fab2c201`.

### 2. Scenario setups vs. printed text, at 1 and 3 players

New file `packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/setup-scaling.test.ts`: every scenario's own printed `Setup:` sentence
(cross-checked against `docs/cards/by_pack/gmw.md`'s own transcription, not just the script), driven for real via
`createGame` + `settle`, at both 1 and 3 players (no earlier checkpoint ever seated 3):

- Brotherhood of Badoon: Badoon Ship + Milano in play, starting threat = 2×players.
- Infiltrate the Museum: The Collection has exactly one card per player, starting threat = 4×players.
- Escape the Museum: Library Labyrinth in play; Milano correctly still set-aside, not put into play until stage
  2A's own When Revealed (16083a) — proves the setup sentence's own scope is exactly what it prints, not "every
  card this scenario will eventually use." Starting threat = 7×players.
- Nebula: Nebula's Ship + Milano in play, Power Stone attached to Nebula, starting threat = 2×players, and "discard
  the top 2[per_hero] cards, attach each Technique discarded this way" verified by summing the encounter discard
  pile (starts empty on a fresh game — no earlier setup step touches it) and Technique attachments on Nebula to
  exactly 2×players, since which specific cards a seed discards is random.
- Ronan the Accuser: Kree Command Ship + Milano in play, Universal Weapon attached to Ronan, Power Stone attached
  to the first player's identity, starting threat = 2×players.
- One test per scenario confirming expert mode starts on a genuinely different villain stage/card than standard
  (comparing real `GameState`s directly, not re-deriving the expected stage/card from the same content data being
  tested), rather than assuming the existing outcome-only expert smoke games already proved the setup step itself.

All 15 tests passed after two staging fixes found while writing them (not rules bugs, test-construction traps):
`createGame` runs a standalone game's own scenario setup inline, so a "before" snapshot has to come from
`config.encounterDeck`, not `created.state`; and Nebula's Technique/discard split needed proving via a sum
invariant (discard pile + Technique attachments = 2×players) rather than a raw deck-length diff, since the deck
also contains cards the _fixed_ pre-setup baseline can't cleanly isolate. No printed-text-vs-script mismatch found.
Commit: `16e4bf8c`.

### 3. Encounter boost abilities and villain keywords, exercised not structural

**Boost abilities:** grepped every `.boost` ability id in `packages/content/src/data/gmw/cards.ts` (29 total, every
Technique/minion/treachery/side-scheme boost in the box) against every `wave3/gmw/*.test.ts` file. All 29 have at
least one test reference; spot-checked 13 of them directly (Techniques 16094-16098, Badoon Headhunter's ladder
16183-16185, Universal Weapon 16109, Cut the Power 16111, "You Stand Accused!" 16116, Collector's own boost 16086,
Biogram Image 16074, Inconspicuous Box 16076, Starshark 16137, Nebula's own boost-reveal 16140) — every one drives
a real `driveEvents`/`endTurn` and asserts a real state change (damage taken, threat placed, boost card count,
attachment made), not a structural "does the ability id exist" check. No gap found; not exhaustively re-verified
for the remaining 16 (time budget), but the sampling method (every case checked was genuinely driven) gives no
reason to expect the rest are different.

**Villain keywords:** read every villain stage's `keywords` array directly from `cards.ts` (not the printed-text
transcription, since keyword grants are data, not text). Drang, both Collector cards (Infiltrate the Museum's and
Escape the Museum's separate 16070/16080a/16081a), and Nebula print **no** villain keywords at all. Ronan prints
Toughness (stages I/II, already exercised by every test in `ronan.test.ts` via its own `clearTough` staging) and,
**only at stage III**, Retaliate 1 — which had never actually been driven: reached by existing tests, but never
attacked again afterward to see the reflected damage. Fixed: a new test drives a real (clearly non-defeating)
attack against Ronan III and confirms the attacker takes exactly 1 damage back (RRG 1.8 "Retaliate", p. 41). Test:
`packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/ronan.test.ts`. Commit: `d6581f02`.

### 4. Smoke games at 3 and 4 players

New file `packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/three-four-player-e2e.test.ts` (mirrors `wave4/hood` and `wave4/mts`'s own
`three-four-player-e2e.test.ts` shape from the same coordinator ask): one 3p-standard and one 4p-expert game per
scenario (10 games), plus one extra 4p-standard Nebula game folding in Venom's kit so all six wave 3 hero packs
(Groot, Rocket Raccoon, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Venom) are exercised against a `gmw` villain at higher player
counts, not just the two precons `gmw` ships with. All 11 games reach a real `GameOutcome`, no stuck
`PendingChoice`, deep-equal replay. Commit: `64464738`.

### 5. Spot re-audit: 10 cards each from Groot, Rocket, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Venom, and the gmw box

**Method note, itself a finding:** the first coverage pass used `grep '"$id\.'` (a literal quote immediately before
the printed id) to find test references, which produces false negatives against the pack's own citation style
(ability ids are usually cited parenthetically at the end of a test name, `it("... (16031.reload-action)", ...)`,
with no leading quote) — an early scan of Rocket's kit wrongly flagged four cards as untested that were, on a
corrected re-check (`id + "."` anywhere in the file), thoroughly covered. Re-ran the scan for `stld`/`gam`/`drax`/
`vnm` kit cards and gmw's own encounter-side cards (treachery/side-scheme/minion/environment/attachment, 84 cards)
with the corrected pattern.

- **Groot (10 read by hand against `docs/cards/by_pack/gmw.md`):** Root Stomp, Entangling Vines, Lashing Vines,
  Vine Shield, Vine Spikes, Starhawk, Desperate Defense, Dauntless, Hard to Ignore, Rocket Raccoon (ally). Nine
  clean and genuinely driven. **Desperate Defense (16013) was not** — a verbatim reprint of Core/wave 1's own
  09015, aliased programmatically by `../reprints.ts` rather than hand-scripted, and the only place it appeared in
  any gmw test (`ronan.test.ts`) used it purely incidentally, as an [energy]-cost filler card for an unrelated
  payment test, never exercising its own printed effect ("+2 DEF... if you take no damage, ready your hero").
  **Fixed**: a real defend sequence (Groot vs. Rhino, Crowd Control staged so the bonus genuinely changes the
  outcome) proving both halves. Test: `packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/groot-kit.test.ts`. Commit: `5d197e64`.
- **Rocket, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Venom (corrected-pattern scan across every kit card, not a hand-read 10 each
  — see method note):** every non-reprint, hand-scripted card has at least one real test reference. The only
  "missing" hits after correction are verbatim reprints (Chase Them Down 16041, Get Ready 17016, The Power of
  Leadership 17018, Uppercut 18014, Combat Training 18017, Counter-Punch 19014, Resourceful 20020, and every
  generic Energy/Genius/Strength resource card) — the same shape as Groot's own Desperate Defense, all aliased by
  `../reprints.ts`, all with the underlying ability logic already proven by an earlier wave's own test. **Not
  independently re-driven one-by-one in their new packs** (time budget, and diminishing marginal value: each would
  prove the same shared `../reprints.ts` aliasing mechanism the Desperate Defense fix above already proved works
  for wave 3 in general, not a card-specific risk) — flagged rather than assumed identical; a future pass should
  spot-check at least one more per pack if reprint-aliasing regresses again.
- **gmw's own encounter-side cards (84 scanned):** the scan's own "missing" list was entirely false negatives —
  Vendetta (16054), Blackjack O'Hare (16055), Monarch Starstalker (16075) and Servant Bot (16136) print no
  card-specific ability text at all (pure keyword-only cards: Quickstrike/Villainous/Guard+Patrol, all generic,
  data-driven engine mechanics with no card-specific script to test); Library Labyrinth (16085) and the Campaign
  Challenge/Headhunter-ladder side schemes (16178-16182, 16186-16187) are genuinely tested, just under a suffixed
  id (`16085a`) or in a sibling test file the scan's glob missed (`campaign-challenge.test.ts`,
  `campaigns/gmw.qa.test.ts`). No new finding here beyond confirming the scan's own false positives.

### 6. Campaign log fields: written and read, including a 2-player elimination

Every `CampaignLog` field `gmw.ts` writes (`collection`, `collectionCount`, `evasionCounters`, `galacticArtifacts`,
`headhunterDefeated`, `healedFull`, `kreeSupremacyRevealed`, `marketCards`, `powerStoneControl`, `remainingHp`,
`units` — 11 total) already has at least one real assertion in `packages/cards/src/campaigns/gmw.qa.test.ts`
(checkpoints 3-4) that it's written when it should be and read by a later setup instruction; re-confirmed by
grepping the test file for each field name (a couple needed a broader grep than the exact field string, since some
tests assert the field's own _downstream effect_ — e.g. `kreeSupremacyRevealed` is proven by whether the right side
scheme is actually in play, not by asserting the log value directly — rather than the literal name). The specific
new ask — a 2-player run with one player eliminated — is already covered: checkpoint 4's `'MC16 p. 5 "Elimination
and Victory"'` describe stages a real, settled 2-seat Brotherhood of Badoon game with seat 2 marked `eliminated:
true` on a won `GameState`, then proves (a) the eliminated seat gets no Victory-step writes at all
(`campaignResultOf`'s own `sittingOut` field), and (b) the eliminated seat's `remainingHp` is instead recorded as
its own printed HP (the free rejoin, ruling June 2, 2026 (3) #1) when folded into the log, ready for Infiltrate the
Museum's own `hpSetSetup` to read at that scenario's setup. No new test needed; no gap found.

### Files touched, coordinator follow-up

- `packages/client/src/campaign/dev-fixtures.ts` / `dev-fixtures.test.ts` — item 1.
- `packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/setup-scaling.test.ts` (new) — item 2.
- `packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/ronan.test.ts` — item 3.
- `packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/three-four-player-e2e.test.ts` (new) — item 4.
- `packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/groot-kit.test.ts` — item 5.
- `docs/phase7-wave3-qa.md` — this section.

### What this follow-up did not get to

- Items 3 and 5's own "not exhaustively re-verified" carve-outs above (16 more boost abilities spot-checked by
  sampling method only; reprinted cards in Rocket/Star-Lord/Gamora/Drax/Venom not individually re-driven in their
  new packs).
- A genuine engine-driven (not staged) 2-player elimination for item 6 — the existing test stages `eliminated: true`
  directly on a real settled `GameState` rather than driving an actual lethal villain-phase attack that eliminates
  the player through normal engine rules; this proves the campaign-log read/write side but not the elimination
  trigger itself (which is generic engine behavior, not gmw-specific, and was treated as out of scope for this
  campaign-log-focused item).
