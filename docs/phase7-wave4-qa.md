# Phase 7 wave 4 rules-QA pass

`rules-qa-engineer` independent QA pass over wave 4 (cycle 3: `nebu`, `warm`, `valk`, `vision`, `mts`, `hood`).
Modeled on `docs/phase7-wave3-qa.md`. Per the standing ownership boundary: this pass finds and proves bugs with
tests; it does not fix engine or card-script code beyond small, obviously-safe test tightening. Every finding cites
the printed text and the authority (RRG 1.8 page or a dated post-1.7 ruling) it was checked against.

**Scope note, stated up front rather than implied by omission:** wave 4 landed with an unusually large amount of
its own rules-QA already built in as part of scripting (`docs/phase7-wave4.md` names `rules-qa-engineer` in its own
§5 task list for exactly three items: a Tower Defense double-KO test, a Loki swap-with-attachments test, and a full
campaign run/retry/permanent-removal test). This pass found that the wave's own scripting work had already closed
most of the highest-priority items the brief calls out by name — the four decided rulings (Q9, Q16, Q17, Q5) and
Loki's two defeat interrupts (§3.48) all already carry real regression tests, and the wave's own e2e suite already
covers standard/2-player/expert games for The Hood and standard/expert for every `mts` scenario including Tower
Defense. Given that, and the size of the six-pack, ~59-primitive scope against the time budget, this pass
prioritized item 1 (test-quality sweep) as instructed, verified the item-4 pins are real and not just claimed, and
did a targeted (not exhaustive) card-by-card audit rather than a full line-by-line sweep of all six packs. What
was **not** reached is listed explicitly under "What this pass did not do," per the standing rule that a thin pass
should say so rather than imply full coverage.

## 1. Test-quality audit (priority)

Swept wave 4's 53 test files (`packages/cards/src/wave4/**/*.test.ts`) for the four patterns named in the task: a
ref named in a test title but not exercised, a boost never resolved as a boost, `toBeGreaterThan`/`<=`/`||` in place
of an exact assertion, and a test naming two refs but exercising one.

### Findings tightened directly (small, in scope for this agent)

1. **`packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/mister-hyde.test.ts`, "24034.when-revealed" — fired-but-not-verified.** The
   test named "Mister Hyde attacks with +2 ATK and overkill when he is in play" only asserted
   `fired(events, "24034.when-revealed")` — that the ability triggered — and checked neither the +2 ATK bonus nor
   the overkill keyword the printed text (`hood/mister-hyde.ts`, 24034) requires. This is exactly the "fired but
   never took effect" shape `docs/phase7-wave4.md` §3.51 documents as a real engine bug this wave found and fixed
   for this same card (Calvin Zabo's own `enemyAttack.keywords`) — the generic mechanism is proven in
   `packages/engine/src/hood-primitives.test.ts`, but the card's own test never independently re-confirmed it
   post-fix. **Tightened:** isolates the `damageDealt` event sourced from Mister Hyde's own instance and asserts
   both his ordinary activation (3, undefended, no bonus) and Calvin Zabo's triggered attack (5, +2 ATK) land in the
   same villain phase. Would have failed against the pre-§3.51 script (no `keywords`, and had `atkBonus` also been
   missing, against 3 not 5). Printed text: `hood/mister-hyde.ts` inline transcription of 24034. Authority:
   `docs/phase7-wave4.md` §3.51.
2. **`packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-kit.test.ts`, "26005.solar-gem-constant / 26005.solar-gem-resource" —
   two refs named, zero exercised.** The test named both Solar Gem abilities ("grants Aerial; attaches to Vision")
   but only checked that the upgrade attached — never that it grants the AERIAL trait (the constant), and never
   drove the resource ability (exhaust → 1 wild resource) at all. **Tightened, split into two tests:** one confirms
   `traitsOf` does not include AERIAL before the gem is in play and does after (via `@mc/engine`'s `traitsOf`); the
   other exhausts Solar Gem through its own `resourceAbility` to pay the entire cost of an unrelated card (Indomitable, 26017) and confirms both the exhaustion and the attachment landing. Printed text: `vision/vision-kit.ts`
   `26005.solar-gem-constant`/`26005.solar-gem-resource`. Authority: card text is unambiguous; no ruling needed.

Both changes are pure test tightening (no script or engine change); `pnpm check`-equivalent (lint, format, typecheck,
targeted test run) passed for both files (see "Test counts").

### Findings not tightened, filed instead (scope/time)

The sweep above (grep for `toBeGreaterThan`/`toBeLessThan` across all 53 files returned 37 hits; grep for a test
title naming two `<code>.<ref>` pairs returned ~19 hits) is wider than the two items above — those two were
followed to a concrete verdict because they matched the task's own named examples (Calvin Zabo, and the
"named two refs, exercised one" shape) most closely. **The remaining ~35 `toBeGreaterThan`/`toBeLessThan` hits and
~17 other two-ref titles were not individually re-verified this pass** — most looked legitimate on inspection
(e.g. Vivian's own two-ref test at `vision-kit.test.ts:138` genuinely exercises both halves: THW while Intangible
_and_ ATK while Dense, each with an exact stat comparison, not a threshold), but "looked legitimate on a skim" is
not the same as verifying each one individually, so this is recorded as **thin coverage confidence, not a clean
bill of health** for the rest of the sweep. A full second pass through every hit is the natural next step for
whoever picks this back up.

### Avatar of Death / Calvin Zabo (the two keywords named in the task brief)

Both were investigated specifically because the task brief names them. **Both are already fixed and regression-tested
generically:** `docs/phase7-wave4.md` §3.51 documents the exact bug (an `enemyAttack` effect followed by a sibling
`modifyAttack` effect runs after the attack it initiated has already resolved, since the stack is LIFO, so the
keyword never attaches) for three cards — Total Annihilation (`hood` 24054), Avatar of Death (`mts` 21120), and
Calvin Zabo (`hood` 24034) — and its "Status: landed" note confirms all three were re-scripted against a new
`EffectSpec enemyAttack.keywords?` field, proven generically in `packages/engine/src/hood-primitives.test.ts` (an
overkill attack of 4 against a 3-HP defending ally spills exactly 1 onto the hero; the same attack without the
keyword spills nothing) and in real games (`standard-expert-ii.test.ts` for Total Annihilation). **What this pass
added:** Calvin Zabo's own card-specific test (finding 1 above) previously only checked the ability fired, not that
the keyword/bonus actually landed for _that card_ post-fix — now it does. **Avatar of Death's own card-specific
test** (`mts/thanos.test.ts` "Avatar of Death (21120)") still only checks `damage` `toBeGreaterThan` before an
undefended attack against the identity — it does not independently re-verify the overkill/piercing keywords for
_this_ card post-fix, the same gap Calvin Zabo had. **Filed, not fixed this pass** (time budget): tighten
`21120.when-revealed-hero`'s test the same way — a defending ally at a HP total below Thanos's ATK, asserting an
`overkillSpilled` event, plus a `giveTough` on the identity beforehand to prove piercing bypasses it (piercing
against a toughened defender should still deal full damage, where without piercing a `tough` status would absorb
it). Owner: `rules-qa-engineer` (next pass) or `ability-scripting-engineer` if a script change turns out to be
needed once tested.

## 2. Regression pins for the wave's decided rulings (task item 4)

Verified each ruling the brief calls out by name already has a real, driven regression test (not just claimed
"landed" in the design doc) — re-read each test file to confirm it exercises the decision, not merely a symptom
adjacent to it:

Confirmed live in the tower-defense test: at threshold, `flipped` becomes `true` and the state reflects the Stronghold-side script's own effects. |

**Lesson carried forward from wave 3's own "Resolutions" section** ("an `it.fails` test passes on _any_ throw,
including a setup error — a pin must be seen failing on its assertion before it is committed"): none of the five
pins above are `it.fails`/`test.fails` pins (all decisions are already implemented and passing), so that specific
trap does not apply to them. Re-confirmed anyway by reading each assertion, not just the test name, since a
passing test whose assertion is trivially true would have the same blind spot.

## 3. Card-by-card audit (task item 2) — targeted, not exhaustive

Given the time budget, prioritized the interactions the task explicitly calls highest-risk: Spectrum's forms,
Adam Warlock's aspects, Vision's density, and the five scenarios' villain AI/boost/set-aside flows.

- **Vision's density (Intangible/Dense mass forms):** `vision-kit.test.ts`'s existing coverage (Vivian's dual
  bonus, Vision's Cape's dual keyword grant, Density Manipulation's own flip-and-draw) already exercises both
  states with exact stat/keyword assertions, not thresholds — confirmed clean on inspection, and Solar Gem's own
  gap is fixed above (finding 2).
- **Spectrum's forms and Adam Warlock's aspects:** not independently re-audited this pass beyond the test-quality
  sweep above (which touched `spectrum-kit.test.ts`, `spectrum-pack-cards.test.ts`, `adam-warlock-kit.test.ts`,
  `adam-warlock-pack-cards.test.ts` only for the weak-test patterns, not a full text-vs-script read). **Flagged as
  not done**, not assumed clean.
- **Scenario villain AI / boosts / set-aside flows:** Loki's swap (§3.48, verified above), Tower Defense's two
  simultaneous villains and Avengers Tower flip (Q9, verified above), and The Hood's Standard II/Expert II wiring
  (Q5, verified above) were checked as part of the regression-pin verification. Ebony Maw's and Hela's own
  scenario-specific scripts were not independently re-read against printed text this pass beyond what their own
  e2e games already exercise generically (see item 3 below).

## 4. Game-level scenarios (task item 3)

**Not newly built this pass — verified existing coverage instead**, since the wave's own scripting work already
landed real e2e games for every scenario in scope:

| Pack   | Scenario      | Mode(s)                                  | Players                        | File                                                                              |
| ------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mts`  | Ebony Maw     | standard, expert                         | 1                              | `mts/ebony-maw-e2e.test.ts`                                                       |
| `mts`  | Thanos        | standard, expert                         | 1                              | `mts/thanos-e2e.test.ts`                                                          |
| `mts`  | Hela          | standard, expert                         | 1                              | `mts/hela-e2e.test.ts`                                                            |
| `mts`  | Tower Defense | standard, expert                         | 1                              | `mts/tower-defense.test.ts` ("e2e: a hero plays Tower Defense to a real outcome") |
| `mts`  | Rhino (Core)  | standard                                 | 1 (Spectrum), 1 (Adam Warlock) | `mts/e2e.test.ts`                                                                 |
| `hood` | The Hood      | standard, expert (Standard II/Expert II) | 1, **2**                       | `hood/e2e.test.ts`                                                                |

All six read `GameOutcome`/replay-deep-equal assertions (spot-checked `tower-defense.test.ts`'s and `hood/e2e.test.ts`'s
own assertions directly, matching the described shape). Re-ran the full set as part of this pass's own test run (see
"Test counts") — all pass, no crashes, no `internal_error`.

**Gaps found, not filled this pass (time budget):**

- No **2-player** game for any `mts` scenario (only The Hood has one).
- No 2-player or expert game for `nebu`/`warm`/`valk`/`vision` against any `mts` scenario or each other — each
  pack's own `e2e.test.ts` (confirmed to exist for all four) was not individually re-read this pass to confirm
  mode/player-count coverage the way `mts`/`hood` were.
- Ebony Maw/Hela/Thanos each have exactly one seed per mode; no cross-seed stability spot-check beyond what already
  exists.

## What this pass did not do

Stated explicitly per the standing instruction that thin coverage should be said, not implied:

- **A full line-by-line audit of all six packs' printed text against their scripts** — the brief's literal ask for
  item 2. This pass did a targeted read (test-quality sweep + the two named keywords + the five decided rulings),
  not a systematic pass over every card in `nebu`, `warm`, `valk`, `vision`'s own kits, obligations and nemesis
  sets, nor Spectrum's/Adam Warlock's own aspects in full.
- **The three items `docs/phase7-wave4.md` §5 itself assigns to `rules-qa-engineer` by name**: a Tower Defense test
  where both villains reach 0 in one attack, a Loki swap carrying attachments/status cards/the dial, and the
  campaign's full run/retry/permanent-removal. Not attempted this pass (time budget) — flagged as the most
  concrete, pre-named follow-up for whoever picks this back up next, since they are not generic QA asks but the
  wave's own design doc naming specific untested shapes.
- **The remaining ~35 `toBeGreaterThan`/`toBeLessThan` hits and ~17 two-ref test titles** from the sweep, beyond
  the two resolved above — spot-checked a few (clean), not exhaustively re-verified.
- **`nebu`/`warm`/`valk` packs' own audits** beyond the test-quality sweep — no dedicated finding either way; not
  reached.
- **2-player/expert smoke games beyond what already existed** — verified, not extended.

## Test counts

Ran targeted, not full-repo (time budget did not allow a full `pnpm check` re-run across every package after this
narrow a change set; the two touched files were individually lint/format/typecheck/test-clean):

- `npx oxlint` and `npx oxfmt --check` on both touched files: clean.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` for `@mc/cards`: clean.
- `npx vitest run src/wave4` (`@mc/cards`): **53 test files, 614 tests, all passed** (includes both tightened
  tests, all e2e games listed in §4 above, and the five regression pins verified in §2).

## Files touched

- `packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/mister-hyde.test.ts` — tightened the 24034 test (Finding 1).
- `packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-kit.test.ts` — split the Solar Gem test into two, each exercising its own
  ref (Finding 2).
- `docs/phase7-wave4-qa.md` — this report (new).

## Checkpoint 2: §5's three items verified/built (A), Avatar of Death tightened (B)

Addressed the coordinator's follow-up items A and B, in order. C (the ~35/~17 sweep), D (2-player `mts` games) and
E (the `nebu`/`warm`/`valk`/rest-of-`mts`/`hood` printed-text audit) are the next items, not started this checkpoint.

### A. §5's three pre-assigned items

Verified two are real (not rebuilt); wrote the third, which did not previously have a card-level test.

1. **Tower Defense double defeat** (§3.3) — **verified, real.**
   `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/tower-defense.test.ts`, `"§3.3: both villains reaching 0 in one attack are both
   defeated (Jun 2, 2026 (2) simultaneous damage)"`: both Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive are patched to lethal
   damage, one is killed with a real `basicAttack`, and the test asserts **both** villains' own `defeated` flags are
   `true` and `after.outcome?.result === "win"` — a real, driven simultaneous-defeat, not a synthetic state check.
   Re-ran clean.
2. **The campaign's full run, retry and permanent removal** — **verified, real, and correctly scoped.**
   `packages/cards/src/campaigns/mts.qa.test.ts`'s own header explains why there is no "permanent removal" test:
   MC21's five scenarios (pp. 4–28, checked) print no `removeFromCampaign`-shaped instruction to exercise one
   against. What the file proves instead, driven through the real campaign runner
   (`createCampaignLog`/`resolveBetweenGames`/`applyCampaignResult`, not a synthetic shortcut):
   - `"plays all five scenarios in standard mode, with a loss and a retry on Tower Defense, to a pinned final log"` —
     a full 5-node walk, Tower Defense lost then retried and won, ending `log.status === "won"` with the exact
     per-node history pinned.
   - The loss-and-retry step specifically proves `cosmoInPool`/`securityBreachInPool` (earned at Ebony Maw, the
     scenario _before_ the loss) survive the Tower Defense retry unchanged — the closest analogue MC21 actually
     prints to "a permanent effect survives a retry," since it has no printed removal instruction of its own.
   - `"expert campaign: hit points carry over scenario to scenario, capped at base, and losing the last scenario
     loses the campaign"` — the box's own persistent-HP rule, separately proven.
     Re-ran clean (`packages/cards/src/campaigns/mts.qa.test.ts` + `tower-defense.test.ts`, 32 tests, all pass).
3. **The Loki swap carrying attachments, status cards and the dial (§3.7)** — **no card-level test existed; written
   this checkpoint.** `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/loki.test.ts`, new test `"§3.7: an advance-swap carries
   attachments and status cards on the same instance, and each Loki's own dial (single-stage: stageIndex 0) stays"`:
   attaches Loki's Staff (21170) and gives the villain a confused status card (not "tough" — that would intercept
   the test's own lethal attack and prevent the advance-swap this test needs to happen at all), triggers the
   advance-to-set-aside-villain path (All Hail King Loki 1B's forced interrupt, the same shape `loki.test.ts`
   already drives for its own When Defeated test), and confirms on the **same InstanceId**, post-swap: the
   attachment is still `attachedTo` it (both directions), the status card is still present, and the dial
   (`stageIndex`) is unchanged at 0. Cites `docs/phase7-wave4.md` §3.7/§4 (damage does not carry on a
   defeat-advance, already proven by the pre-existing "at full health" assertion in the neighboring test) and
   `packages/engine/src/resolve/villain-swap.ts`'s own `exchangeCards`/`advanceToSetAsideVillain` (only `cardId` and
   `stageIndex` are touched; `attachments`/`statuses` are keyed to the instance and untouched by either function).
   Every Loki is single-stage (`packages/content/src/data/mts/cards.ts`), so "the dial stays" is trivially
   `stageIndex 0` before and after here — asserted explicitly rather than left implicit. **Found and worked around
   live while writing this test:** `forceLoki`'s own docblock caveat ("the next one may carry any Loki code") is
   real — the random set-aside pick can legitimately land back on the same code (21160) it started at, just a
   different instance underneath; the test does not assert which code comes back, only that the instance, its
   attachment and its status card persist. Re-ran clean (34 tests in the file, all pass).

### B. Avatar of Death (`mts` 21120) tightened

`packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/thanos.test.ts`, `"21120.when-revealed-hero: the attack it initiates gains overkill
(an exact spill) and piercing (an exact tough bypass)"` replaces the old `toBeGreaterThan` test. **Not a simple
port of the Calvin Zabo fix** — three real complications, found live, are recorded in the test's own comments:

1. **Thanos also has his own separate, undefended, non-piercing regular villain-phase activation the same round**
   (unrelated to 21120), with its own `declareDefender` prompt that resolves _before_ 21120 is even revealed. A
   defender picker that greedily declares Captain America for the first prompt it sees spends her tough on the
   _wrong_ attack (confirmed live: the engine's own event log showed `damagePrevented`/`statusRemoved
   {reason: "preventedDamage"}` for that attack, not `{reason: "piercing"}`), leaving nothing for the piercing test
   to prove by the time 21120's own attack happens.
2. **`21120.when-revealed-hero`'s own "ability" stack frame pops as soon as its effects begin**, before the
   `enemyAttack` those effects push resolves — so a picker that checks `state.stack` for that ability id at
   `declareDefender` time never finds it. Fixed by watching for the ability's own `abilityResolved` event (already
   in the accumulated event log by then) instead of the live stack, via a small local `driveEventsWith` helper
   (`../../testing/staging.js`'s own `driveEvents`, generalized to take a caller `Picker` instead of a hardcoded
   `firstLegal`, so a `declareDefender` choice can be steered while the full event log is still collected).
3. **Aggregate identity damage across the whole villain phase is not a reliable signal** for either keyword, since
   it can't distinguish "21120's own attack pierced" from "the other activation's ordinary attack landed after tough
   had already been spent by 21120's" — both produce the same total. The test instead asserts on two
   engine-typed events **`overkillSpilled`** and **`statusRemoved` (`reason: "piercing"`)**, each emitted only by the
   specific attack that causes it, so the assertion is exact and unambiguous regardless of what else the round does.
   The overkill amount is cross-checked against the same attack's own `attackResolved.damageDealt` minus Captain
   America's 1 remaining hit point (a real content boost card contributes to the total, so the exact number is
   read from the attack's own event rather than hardcoded, but the _relationship_ — spilled equals damage dealt
   minus what the target could absorb — is the actual rule being proven, not a tautology: `overkillSpilled` would
   be absent entirely, not merely a smaller number, if overkill weren't active).

**Verified as a real pin, not just a passing assertion**, per the standing "run it once as a plain test to see it
fail" lesson: temporarily stripped `keywords: ["overkill", "piercing"]` from `21120.when-revealed-hero`'s script,
confirmed the new test fails (no `overkillSpilled` event at all), then restored the script (`git diff` empty
afterward — the source file is unchanged from before this checkpoint).

### Files touched, checkpoint 2

- `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/loki.test.ts` — new test for §3.7's attachment/status/dial carry-over (item A.3).
- `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/thanos.test.ts` — Avatar of Death's test rewritten (item B); adds a local
  `driveEventsWith`/`EventAwarePicker` helper.
- `docs/phase7-wave4-qa.md` — this section.

### Test counts, checkpoint 2

- `npx oxlint` and `npx oxfmt --check` on both touched test files: clean.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` for `@mc/cards`: clean.
- `npx vitest run src/wave4/mts` (`@mc/cards`): **21 test files, 279 tests, all passed.**
- `npx vitest run src/campaigns/mts.qa.test.ts src/wave4/mts/tower-defense.test.ts`: 32 tests, all passed
  (re-confirming item A.1/A.2 rather than assuming their prior "landed" status).

## Checkpoint 3: C (toBeGreaterThan/two-ref sweep), D (2-player `mts` games), E (printed-text audit)

Time-boxed given the scale found (121 `toBeGreaterThan`/`toBeLessThan` lines across 36 files, not the ~35/~17
originally estimated) — went as deep as the budget allowed, flagged everything not individually re-verified rather
than assumed clean. Full `pnpm cards` suite re-run clean after every change (see counts below).

### C. The `toBeGreaterThan`/`toBeLessThan`/two-ref sweep

**Scale, corrected:** `grep -c "toBeGreaterThan\|toBeLessThan"` across `packages/cards/src/wave4/*/*.test.ts`
returns **121** hits in 36 files (107 outside the `*-e2e.test.ts` files, which are real multi-round smoke games
where a loose bound is the right call, not a weak-test smell — `tower-defense.test.ts`'s own docblock states this
distinction explicitly: "every `.when-revealed`/`.boost` ref is asserted by its exact effect… not a loose
`toBeGreaterThan`/`<=`/`\|\|`", reserving the loose form for its own §3.3 AI-driven smoke section). Two real fixes
were made from this sweep, each verified against the actual game mechanics rather than guessed:

1. **`packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/adam-warlock-kit.test.ts`, "21035.warlocks-cape-response,
   21037.mystic-senses-response"** — named both refs, but the original `toBeGreaterThan(before - 2)` assertion is
   satisfied even if _neither_ Response fired. **Found live while fixing it:** the two abilities do different
   things (Warlock's Cape _readies_ Adam Warlock; only Mystic Senses _draws_), and the hand-length snapshot
   ("before") is taken _before_ Battle Mage's own cost (discarding a Justice card) is paid, so the net hand-size
   change across the whole `use()` is 0 (−1 cost, +1 draw) even though the draw genuinely fires — an initial "fix"
   to `toBe(before + 2)`, then `toBe(before + 1)`, both failed against the real trace before this was diagnosed.
   Tightened to check the _deck_ shrinking by exactly 1 (isolating the draw from the cost) and the identity's
   `exhausted` flag (isolating the ready) — each keyword's own effect proven independently. Re-ran clean.
2. Spot-checked roughly 15 more two-ref titles by reading the ability definitions and their tests side by side
   (not re-run individually beyond the file's own existing suite): `hood-gaps.test.ts` (24039/24040, looped over
   both codes), `ebony-maw.test.ts` (21083's two constants, checked via `toMatchObject` on the plain ability
   data — both refs genuinely asserted), `war-machine-pack-cards.test.ts` (23012, both the attach and the
   play-as-if-from-hand halves exercised), `vision-kit.test.ts` (26003 Vivian, both stat deltas checked exactly).
   All came out clean — each test does exercise both named refs, just not always the same way (some drive a real
   game, some assert the compiled `AbilityDefinition` shape directly, which is legitimate for two abilities documented
   as intentionally identical, e.g. 21072/21073 mirroring 21071 verbatim).

**Not individually re-verified this pass** (flagged, not assumed clean): the remaining ~105 `toBeGreaterThan`/
`toBeLessThan` lines and ~13 more two-ref titles. A representative sample (`infinity-gauntlet.test.ts`,
`ebony-maw.test.ts`, `hela.test.ts`, `loki.test.ts`, `thanos.test.ts`) was read for shape rather than executed against
alternate scripts: most guard against real, AI-driven villain-phase games where more than one activation can land in
the same round (the exact trap the Avatar of Death fix below hit), so a loose bound there is plausibly the right
call by the same logic `tower-defense.test.ts` states outright — but "plausibly right by the same pattern" is not
"independently confirmed," and this file should not be read as having cleared all 105.

### B (continued): Avatar of Death, done properly this checkpoint

(Already reported above under "Findings not tightened, filed instead" and Checkpoint 2 §B — recorded here again only
to cross-reference: this is the same fix, item B of the coordinator's follow-up.)

### D. A 2-player game for each `mts` scenario

**New file:** `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/two-player-e2e.test.ts` — table-driven across all five `mts` scenarios
(Ebony Maw, Thanos, Hela, Loki, Tower Defense), Spectrum + Adam Warlock (both real precons), standard mode, one
seed, played headlessly to a real outcome with a deterministic replay check (the same shape every existing solo
`*-e2e.test.ts` file already uses). All five passed on the first run with no debugging needed — `spectrumScenario`'s
own `extraPlayers` option (already used by `hela.test.ts`'s own 2-player tests) made this straightforward once item
B's own lesson (activation-order surprises) was already learned the hard way.

### E. Printed-text-vs-script audit: `nebu` (full), `warm`/`valk`/rest-of-`mts`/`hood` (not reached)

**`nebu` (Nebula), full pack, line-by-line against `docs/cards/by_pack/nebu.md`:** identity (22001a/b), full kit
(22002–22010), obligation (Inferiority Complex, 22027), nemesis set (Gamora minion 22028, Self-Preservation 22029,
Lethal Weapon 22030, Old Rivals 22031), and every remaining pack card (22011–22026, 22032–22035) — `nebula-kit.ts`,
`nebula-obligation-nemesis.ts`, `nebula-pack-cards.ts` read in full. All clean: target, "you" vs. "each player",
may/must, timing word, cost vs. effect, and the "already X" ordering pattern (`22027.obligation`'s "if no upgrade
was discarded this way" reads a bound var set by the actual `chooseCards`/`moveCards` result, not a guess; Old
Rivals' errata'd two-part attack is scripted as two independent `enemyAttack`/`friendlyCharacterAttacks` calls with a
surge fallback exactly matching the printed "if no attack was made this way," cited to ruling Jun 25, 2026 (4) #1
in the script's own comment). No findings.

**Also spot-checked (not a full audit): the "already X" pattern specifically, across `mts`.** Grepped every wave 4
pack script for "already" and read the two clearest hits: Mind Stone (21130) and Power Stone (21131) in
`mts/infinity-gauntlet.ts` — both correctly check `hasStatus(...)` _before_ applying the new status
(`ifThen(hasStatus(...), <already-true branch>, <apply-status branch>)`), the same ordering Deviant Syndrome (`mts` 21121) already got right per the earlier `docs/phase7-wave3-qa.md`-style audit convention. No findings.

**Not reached this checkpoint** (flagged explicitly, not assumed clean): `warm` (War Machine), `valk` (Valkyrie), the
rest of `mts` (Thanos/Hela/Ebony Maw/Loki/Tower Defense/Adam Warlock/Spectrum kits, obligations, nemesis sets, and
every villain/main-scheme/side-scheme text — only spot-checked for the "already X" pattern above, not read in
full), and `hood` (The Hood's own full kit set) — none of these got the `nebu`-style full line-by-line pass. Given
each pack is comparably sized to `nebu` (§ "Scale" above: ~1,600 more lines of transcribed printed text across
`warm`/`valk` alone, `mts`/`hood` considerably larger still), completing this properly is a multi-session effort,
not a checkpoint extension.

### Test counts, checkpoint 3

- `npx oxlint`/`npx oxfmt --check` on the three touched/new files: clean.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` for `@mc/cards`: clean.
- `npx vitest run` (`@mc/cards`, full suite): **205 test files, 2210 tests, all passed** (up from 204/2205 at the
  start of this checkpoint — 5 new 2-player games, 0 net test-count change from the adam-warlock-kit fix since it
  tightened an existing test rather than adding one).

### Files touched, checkpoint 3

- `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/adam-warlock-kit.test.ts` — tightened the Warlock's Cape/Mystic Senses test
  (item C, finding 1).
- `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/two-player-e2e.test.ts` — new: 2-player standard games for all five `mts` scenarios
  (item D).
- `docs/phase7-wave4-qa.md` — this section.

### What checkpoint 3 did not do

- The ~105 remaining `toBeGreaterThan`/`toBeLessThan` lines and ~13 two-ref titles — sampled, not individually
  re-verified.
- `warm`, `valk`, the rest of `mts`, and `hood` — no full printed-text-vs-script audit (only `nebu` got one; a
  narrow "already X" spot-check ran across all of `mts`).
- A 2-player game for The Hood already existed before this pass (`hood/e2e.test.ts`); expert-mode 2-player games for
  the `mts` scenarios were not added (item D asked for standard specifically).

## Checkpoint 4: pass 3, item 1 — every remaining loose-bound line reviewed

The coordinator's pass 3 asked for the ~105 remaining lines and ~13 titles "every one individually." The actual
count was 107 lines in 36 files (outside `*-e2e.test.ts`, already excluded per checkpoint 3's own reasoning). Every
one was read in context; a smaller number were also re-run against a hand-edited exact assertion to empirically
settle ambiguous cases rather than guess. **Six real fixes, one real gap filled, and two loose bounds newly
documented in-line** came out of this; the remainder were judged consistent with an already-established, and in a
few files already self-documented, pattern (a real driven villain phase can compound more than one activation's
worth of damage/threat/status/draws into the same round, so a delta belonging to one specific card's own text isn't
always isolatable without much more staging effort than the assertion is worth) — see "Judged consistent, not

Findings 8 and 9 aren't behavior fixes — the loose bound was already correct — but they close exactly the gap the
coordinator asked about: before this pass, nothing recorded _why_ the bound was loose, so a future reader (or this
same audit, next wave) couldn't tell "checked and legitimately unbounded" apart from "nobody looked." Now they can.

### Judged consistent, not re-executed

The remaining ~95 lines were read in their test's own context (not just grep'd in isolation) and judged against the
same pattern findings 3/8/9 above empirically confirmed: they sit inside a real, driven villain-phase (`endTurn`)
where a second activation, a per-player deal, or the villain's own ordinary attack/scheme can independently
contribute the same kind of change the line is checking. Several files already carry their own explicit docblock or
inline comment saying exactly this (`infinity-gauntlet.test.ts`'s own module docblock is the most thorough — it
found and documented the identical "`endTurn` resolves an entire round, a treachery can trigger a second activation"
fact independently, before this pass existed) or reference the specific real content that compounds (`ebony-maw.test.ts`
`21076`/Fireball; `thanos.test.ts` throughout, per checkpoint 2's own §B). Nothing in this remaining set was found to
be the "fired but never checked" shape (a keyword or effect that silently does nothing) — every one asserts a real
direction of change that the printed card's own text does cause, just not always an isolatable exact amount.

**This is a judgment call, not a re-verification of each of the ~95 lines**, stated plainly rather than implied:
a card whose script has a real bug that happens to move a loose-bound value in the same direction it should — e.g.
an off-by-one that still leaves a counter `> 0` — would not have been caught by this pass. The three or four lines
per file that were spot-tested (findings 3, 4–6, 8, 9 above) came back consistent with the "real compounding, not a
weak test" reading each time, which is the basis for extending that judgment to the rest, not a guarantee.

### Test counts, checkpoint 4

- `npx oxlint`/`npx oxfmt --check` on all six touched files: clean.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` for `@mc/cards`: clean.
- `npx vitest run` (`@mc/cards`, full suite): **205 test files, 2211 tests, all passed** (+1 from checkpoint 3's
  2210 — the new 21030 alter-ego test).

### Files touched, checkpoint 4

- `packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/hood.test.ts`, `hood/sinister-syndicate.test.ts`, `hood/wrecking-crew.test.ts`,
  `mts/spectrum-kit.test.ts`, `mts/spectrum-obligation-nemesis.test.ts`, `mts/thanos.test.ts` — the fixes above.
- `docs/phase7-wave4-qa.md` — this section.

## Checkpoint 5: pass 3, item 2 — full printed-text-vs-script audits, `warm` then `valk`

**Both packs read in full, script against `docs/cards/by_pack/{warm,valk}.md`. No findings in either pack.**

### `warm` (War Machine) — clean

`war-machine-kit.ts` (identity 23001a/b, full kit 23002–23011), `war-machine-obligation-nemesis.ts` (Equipment
Malfunction 23028, Living Laser 23029, Deadly Light Show 23030, Laser Strike 23031), `war-machine-pack-cards.ts`
(23012–23027, 23032–23035) — every ability read against its printed text for target, "you" vs. "each player",
may/must, timing word, cost vs. effect, keyword, and the "already X"/"if you cannot" ordering pattern. Nothing
found: the ammo-counter mechanic's every printed line matches its script exactly (including the two-step "move all
ammo here to War Machine" reading, documented as intentional in the module's own docblock), Equipment Malfunction's
"if 2 or fewer were removed" checks the counter count _before_ the removal effect runs, and Laser Strike's boost
correctly has no surge fallback (only its own When Revealed prints one).

### `valk` (Valkyrie) — clean

`valkyrie-kit.ts` (identity 25001a/b, full kit 25002–25012), `valkyrie-obligation-nemesis.ts` (Trouble in
Otherworld 25028, Enchantress 25029, Powerful Enchantments 25030, Beguiled 25031, Seduced 25032),
`valkyrie-pack-cards.ts` (25013–25024, 25033–25036) — same method. Nothing found: the Death-Glow "attached enemy"
query is shared and correctly scoped everywhere it's read (Valhalla, Valkyrie's Spear, Dragonfang, Flight of the
Valkyrior, Shieldmaiden, Have at Thee!), Death-Glow's own "ready her" correctly reads `extensionOf` rather than a
literal identity match (matching §4 Q14's own decided reading), Seduced's "cannot make basic attacks or play attack
events" is scripted as the two separate restrictions it prints (not just one), and Beguiled's "if you cannot
[attach]" correctly reads the same `isAttached` predicate the module cites as precedent from `wave1/gob`.

### What this checkpoint did not do

`hood` was not started this checkpoint (see the next checkpoint for whether it was reached, or the coordinator's
plan to run a separate parallel agent on the rest of `mts` — this pass did not touch `mts` further this checkpoint,
per the coordinator's own instruction not to duplicate that agent's work).

### Test counts, checkpoint 5

No test files were changed this checkpoint (a read-only audit); the full suite was not re-run since nothing was
touched. `pnpm check`-equivalent state is unchanged from checkpoint 4's own clean run.

### Files touched, checkpoint 5

- `docs/phase7-wave4-qa.md` — this section only (no code changes; `warm` and `valk` came out clean).

## Checkpoint 6: pass 3 — `hood` (the remaining budget)

Budget remained after `warm`/`valk`, so this checkpoint reads `hood`'s own scripts in full: the central villain/main-
scheme/encounter-set file (`hood.ts`) and all nine modular sets (`beasty-boys.ts`, `brothers-grimm.ts`,
`crossfire-crew.ts`, `mister-hyde.ts`, `ransacked-armory.ts`, `sinister-syndicate.ts`, `standard-expert-ii.ts`,
`state-of-emergency.ts`, `streets-of-mayhem.ts`, `wrecking-crew.ts`) against `docs/cards/by_pack/hood.md`. **Not**
`mts` — the coordinator is running a separate parallel QA agent on the rest of `mts`; this pass didn't touch it.

### One real bug found and fixed

**Disaster at the Docks (`hood` 24056): "Take 3 indirect damage" was scripted as plain identity damage, not RRG
1.8's "Indirect Damage."** `state-of-emergency.ts` used `takeDamage(3)` (`dealDamage` straight to the identity),
not `dealIndirectDamage(you, 3)` — the primitive its own sibling cards in the same pack use for the identical
printed phrase (Corrosive Egg Bomb, `hood` 24020; Caught in the Crossfire, `hood` 24028). RRG 1.8 "Indirect Damage"
(p. 24): "Indirect damage dealt to a player can be divided as that player chooses among characters under their
control" — `takeDamage` forces it onto the identity unconditionally, denying the player the choice to put some or
all of it on an ally instead. **Fixed** (a one-line swap, in scope for this agent): `state-of-emergency.ts`'s
`24056.when-revealed` now uses `dealIndirectDamage(you, 3)`. **New regression test**,
`state-of-emergency.test.ts`: puts Black Cat (Core 01002, the scenario's own default starter's ally) into play,
reveals 24056, and picks to split the 3 damage 1-to-the-ally/2-to-the-identity via the real `assignIndirectDamage`
choice — verified to fail against the pre-fix script first (temporarily reverted the fix, re-ran, confirmed the
test fails because the choice never appears at all; restored the fix, `git diff` clean on the source file
afterward). The pack's own pre-existing solo test ("takes exactly 3 indirect damage," no ally in play) still passes
unchanged, since with only the identity to assign to, indirect damage and direct damage look identical.

### One "already X" pattern investigated, not confirmed

**Magic Muscle (`hood` 24070): "If no tough status card was given this way" is scripted as `exists(BRUTE_ENEMY)`
(whether a Brute enemy exists), not whether `giveTough` actually gave one.** `giveStatus`
(`packages/engine/src/effects.ts`) is a no-op once a character is already at its tough capacity — no event, no
state change — so a Brute enemy that's already tough would make `exists(BRUTE_ENEMY)` true (taking the give-tough
branch) while giving nothing, which by the printed text should still trigger the fallback (discard until a Brute is
found and reveal it). **Attempted to prove this live and could not get a clean result**: staging a Brute minion
already toughened and revealing Magic Muscle in a real villain phase, the fallback's own `encounterCardRevealed`
event _did_ appear — but the same round's own other activations (multiple modular sets folded in for setup reasons,
per `wrecking-crew.test.ts`'s own `SETS_WITH_WRECKING_CREW` comment) also produce encounter-card-revealed events,
and isolating which one specifically came from 24070's own fallback rather than an unrelated reveal elsewhere in
the round needed more staging precision than the time budget allowed. **Not filed as a confirmed finding** — the
speculative test was written, found ambiguous, and reverted rather than committed with a misleading pass/fail.
Flagged here as worth a second look with better isolation (a minimal single-modular-set deck, or tracing the
specific `abilityResolved`/`cardMoved` events adjacent to 24070's own frame) rather than asserted as a bug.

### Everything else — clean

`hood.ts`'s central "Foul Play" building block (invoked by name in nineteen-plus other refs across the pack) reads
correctly everywhere it's used, including the two counting patterns that need a snapshot rather than a live check
(Promised Prosperity 24005b's "not dealt at least 1 card," Corruptor 24025's "for each ally exhausted this way,"
both `setVar`-based, both checked against the actual effect's own result rather than a pre-condition). Every other
modular set's targets, "you" vs. "each player," may/must, timing words, costs vs. effects, and keyword grants
matched their printed text. Standard II/Expert II's own two-mode Formidable Foe face-split and Total Annihilation's
overkill (already regression-pinned per Checkpoint 1's §3.51 fix) were both re-confirmed correct on this read too.

### Test counts, checkpoint 6

- `npx oxlint`/`npx oxfmt --check` on both touched files: clean.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` for `@mc/cards`: clean.
- `npx vitest run` (`@mc/cards`, full suite): **205 test files, 2212 tests, all passed** (+1 from checkpoint 5's
  2211 test count — the new Disaster at the Docks regression test).

### Files touched, checkpoint 6

- `packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/state-of-emergency.ts` — the `takeDamage` → `dealIndirectDamage` fix.
- `packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/state-of-emergency.test.ts` — new regression test for the fix.
- `docs/phase7-wave4-qa.md` — this section.

### What this checkpoint did not do / overall pass-3 status

- **Done, all clean or with findings as noted above**: `warm` (checkpoint 5), `valk` (checkpoint 5), `hood`
  (checkpoint 6, one bug fixed).
- **Not done, explicitly left for the parallel agent**: the rest of `mts` (Thanos/Hela/Ebony Maw/Loki/Tower
  Defense/Adam Warlock/Spectrum kits, obligations, nemesis sets, villains/main-schemes/side-schemes) — per the
  coordinator's own instruction not to duplicate that work.
- **Not done, time budget**: the Magic Muscle finding above needs a cleaner live repro or a structural (plain-data)
  check before it can be filed as a real bug; `hood`'s own test files (`hood-gaps.test.ts`,
  `standard-expert-ii.test.ts`, etc.) were read only where directly relevant to the scripts above, not independently
  re-audited for weak-test patterns the way the earlier checkpoints did for `mts`/wave-3 packs (pass 3 item 1's own
  sweep was scoped to the ~107-line list already gathered before `hood` was read this checkpoint, so any
  `hood`-specific loose bounds not already on that list were not separately re-swept).

## Checkpoint 7: Magic Muscle isolated and proven (confirmed bug, not fixed), full audit of the rest of `mts`

### Magic Muscle (`hood` 24070) — confirmed real bug, isolated cleanly this checkpoint

Checkpoint 6 could not isolate this from cross-set noise. Isolated it with a minimal repro: `wrecking-crew.test.ts`'s
own `withSet()` deck (only `wrecking_crew_modular` folded in, no other sets), Wrecker (24065, the only Brute in play)
pre-toughened to capacity via `patchInstance` before the deck is stacked, then the deck stacked (`01186`/`01187`
filler boost cards, then `24070`, then `24067` — a second Brute, Piledriver) so exactly one card is revealed for the
round. Traced the full event log live: `24070.when-revealed` fires; no `statusGiven` event is ever emitted (`giveStatus`,
`packages/engine/src/effects.ts`, is a documented no-op at status capacity); and no `encounterCardRevealed` for
Piledriver (24067) ever happens either — the fallback search never runs. The ability does nothing at all that round,
which the printed text ("If no tough status card was given this way, discard cards from the top of the encounter
deck until a Brute minion is discarded and reveal that minion") does not allow.

**Root cause**: `ifThen(exists(BRUTE_ENEMY), giveTough(each(BRUTE_ENEMY)), [fallback])` branches on whether a Brute
_exists_, not on whether the give actually happened. **Not a one-line script fix**: `giveStatus`'s `EffectSpec`
(`packages/engine/src/spec.ts`) has no way to report which targets actually received the status — unlike
`addCounters`, which already has a `bind` field reporting how many counters were actually placed
(`packages/engine/src/resolve/apply-effect.ts` line ~773), no comparable primitive exists for `giveStatus`. Per this
agent's own scope (find and prove bugs; fix only obvious one-liners), this needed an engine change first, so it was
filed rather than fixed.

**Pin**: `packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/wrecking-crew.test.ts`, `it.fails("24070.when-revealed (bug): a Brute
already at tough capacity must still trigger the fallback search")`. Confirmed failing on its own assertion (not a
setup error) before being marked `.fails`, per the standing rule. **Owner**: `game-rules-architect` (add a
`bind`/count-given field to `giveStatus`, mirroring `addCounters.bind`), then `ability-scripting-engineer` (rewrite
24070's script to branch on that count instead of `exists(BRUTE_ENEMY)`).

> **Fixed (2026-09-25), docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.60:** `giveStatus` gained a `bind` (`<bind>.amount`, how many were
> actually given), 24070 branches on it equalling 0, and the pin is a plain passing `it` (re-confirmed failing on the
> Piledriver-revealed assertion before the fix).

### Printed-text-vs-script audit: the rest of `mts` — complete, no findings

Read every remaining `mts` script in full against `docs/cards/by_pack/mts.md` (the pieces `docs/phase7-wave4-qa.md`
had not yet covered): `children-of-thanos.ts`, `frost-giants.ts`, `legions-of-hel.ts`, `enchantress.ts`,
`spectrum-kit.ts`, `spectrum-pack-cards.ts`, `spectrum-obligation-nemesis.ts`, `adam-warlock-kit.ts`,
`adam-warlock-pack-cards.ts`, `adam-warlock-obligation-nemesis.ts`, `ebony-maw.ts` (including its Black Order/Armies
of Titan modulars), `thanos.ts`, `infinity-gauntlet.ts`, `loki.ts`, `hela.ts`, `tower-defense.ts`, and
`mts-campaign-cards.ts`. Every ability's target ("each"/"a"/"that"), "you" vs. "each player"/"each other player",
may/must, timing word, cost vs. effect, keyword grant, and "already X"/"if none" ordering was checked against the
printed text; watched specifically for the patterns the task named (indirect damage scripted as plain damage,
"if...this way" scripted as existence checks, missing "(Limit once per round)", boost/When Revealed mismatches).

**No new findings.** Two patterns worth recording as confirmed-clean rather than assumed:

- **Agent of Thanos (`mts` 21080)** uses the same `exists(...)`-guard shape as Magic Muscle ("if you place no threat
  this way"/"if you take no damage this way" scripted as `ifThen(exists(SPELLS_IN_YOUR_PLAY_AREA), ...)`) but is
  **not** the same bug: `placeThreat`/`dealDamage` are not capped, idempotent effects the way `giveStatus` is, so
  "a Spell exists" and "threat/damage was actually placed" are equivalent here. Checked directly, not assumed.
- **Infinity Gauntlet's Mind Stone/Power Stone (21130/21131)** correctly use `ifThen(hasStatus(identityOf(you),
  ...), <already-true branch>, <apply-status branch>)` — reading the identity's own current status directly, not an
  existence check on some other query — which is the correct pattern Magic Muscle should have used instead of
  `exists(BRUTE_ENEMY)`.

Every scenario's win/loss shape (Hela's flip-instead-of-defeat, Loki's random-swap/victory-display count, Tower
Defense's twin-villain mutual protection and Avengers Tower flip), every "already X" gate, and every campaign card's
flip-and-reward pair matched the printed text exactly. **Wave 4's rules-QA step (docs/wave-definition-of-done.md §4)
is now complete for `mts`**: `nebu` (checkpoint 3), `warm`/`valk` (checkpoint 5), `hood` (checkpoint 6, one bug
found and fixed), and `mts` (checkpoint 7, one bug found and filed) have all had a full printed-text-vs-script audit.
The one open item is Magic Muscle above (filed, not fixed) — everything else across all six wave 4 packs came back
clean.

### Test counts, checkpoint 7

- `npx oxlint`/`npx oxfmt --check` on the touched file: clean.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` for `@mc/cards`: clean.
- `pnpm check` (full monorepo: lint, fmt:check, typecheck, test, build): **green**. `@mc/cards` test run: **2212
  tests passed, 1 expected fail** (the new Magic Muscle pin).

### Files touched, checkpoint 7

- `packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/wrecking-crew.test.ts` — new `it.fails` pin for the Magic Muscle bug (isolated
  live, root cause identified, not fixed — filed for `game-rules-architect`/`ability-scripting-engineer`).
- `docs/phase7-wave4-qa.md` — this section; wave 4's rules-QA step is now marked complete.

## Full QA pass (2026-09-25)

New independent pass, starting from `feature/wave-4` (already merged with `origin/feature/wave-4`, 207 commits
ahead of this worktree's stale local ref — fast-forwarded cleanly). Read PR #61's own answered-questions list
(`git show origin/claude/outstanding-questions:docs/phase7-wave4.md`) first, per the coordinator's instruction not
to re-fix items it already covers; confirmed via `git diff origin/feature/wave-4...origin/claude/outstanding-questions
--stat` that none of PR #61's changes touch the `vision` pack, so no overlap risk there.

Given the prior seven checkpoints above already delivered a full printed-text-vs-script audit for five of the six
packs in scope (`nebu`, `warm`, `valk`, `hood`, `mts` — checkpoints 3, 5, 6, 7) and this wave's own decided rulings
are all regression-pinned (§2 above), the one pack that was explicitly **not** given a full audit was `vision`
(Checkpoint 1's own scope note calls this out: `vision` only got the test-quality sweep's Solar Gem fix, never the
`nebu`-style line-by-line pass). This pass closes that gap.

### `vision` (Vision) — full printed-text-vs-script audit, no rules bugs found

Read `vision-kit.ts` (identity 26001a/b, full kit 26002–26012), `vision-obligation-nemesis.ts` (Corrupted
Programming 26028, and the Ultron nemesis set: Ultron 26029, Ultron Unleashed 26030, Ultron Drones 26031 — an
aliased Core reprint, Relentless Android 26032), and `vision-pack-cards.ts` (26013–26024, 26033–26036) in full
against `docs/cards/by_pack/vision.md`. Checked every ability's target, "you" vs. "each player", may/must, timing
word, cost vs. effect, keyword grant, and the "already X"/existence-check ordering pattern that Magic Muscle
(checkpoint 7) got wrong elsewhere in the wave.

**No scripting bugs found.** Specific things checked and confirmed correct:

- **Mass form (Intangible/Dense, 26002)**: one double-sided upgrade, `changeAdditionalForm`/`inAdditionalForm`
  correctly scope every conditional ability (Vivian 26003, Vision's Cape 26006, Solar Beam/Superdense
  Strike/Just Passing Through/Phase Disruption/Mass Increase 26008–26012) to the live form, not a snapshot.
  Intangible's "cannot attack or defend" is both `cannotAttack` and `RuleSpec cannotDefend`; Dense's own "draw 1
  card" response is keyed to `on.youChangeToThisForm()` (the specific flip into Dense, not any form change).
- **Corrupted Programming (26028)**: `blanksTextBox(..., { exceptKeywords: true })` correctly targets the mass
  form upgrade via `ofIdentitySetTitled("Vision")` rather than `{ controller: "you" }` (an obligation instance has
  no controller of its own, `packages/engine/src/select.ts`'s `blankedSets`) — re-confirmed live: with the
  obligation staged and revealed, `activeAbilityRefs` on the mass-form instance goes to `[]`, but Density
  Manipulation (which reads the "mass" keyword, not the blanked ability) still finds and flips it.
- **Defiance (26018)**: `{ on: "boostCardTurnedFaceup", playerIs: "controller", activation: "attack" }` — checked
  `trigger-events.ts`'s own docs for `boostCardTurnedFaceup.playerId` ("the player the activation is against,
  'you'"), so `playerIs: "controller"` correctly reads as "an enemy attacking you", matching the printed "on an
  enemy attacking you" without needing an explicit `sourceIs` (the event's `enemyInstanceId` is already always an
  enemy, unlike Preemptive Strike's narrower "the villain," which does add `sourceIs`).
- **Joining Forces (26035)**: `min: 1, max: 1` on both the Avenger and Guardian searches (not `min: 0`) correctly
  makes the whole Alliance action illegal to initiate if either pool is empty, matching "the players put a total of
  1 [Avenger] ally **and** 1 [Guardian] ally" as a joint requirement, not an optional one; `excluding:
  chosen("avenger")` on the second search stops one card from filling both slots.
- **Machine Man (26022)**: `on.basicPowerUsing("self", { power: ["attack", "thwart"] })` correctly excludes defense
  (the errata'd "for this use" wording, RRG 1.5, is read via `modifyBasicPower` scoped to the triggering use, not a
  standing buff).
- **Ultron nemesis set (26029–26032)**: the "Drone" mechanic (`droneFromDeck`) is reused verbatim from Core's own
  Ultron scenario rather than reinvented, matching docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.23's "reusable as is" survey; Ultron's
  own Forced Interrupt correctly gates on `inPlay("Ultron Drones")` before creating a Drone (not an
  existence-check-on-the-wrong-thing shape — the gate is on the _environment_ card, not on whether a Drone was
  already made, so there's no Magic-Muscle-style bug here).

### Test-quality fixes (2, both verified as pure tightening — no bug, exact assertion holds)

Swept `vision-kit.test.ts`, `vision-obligation-nemesis.test.ts`, and `vision-pack-cards.test.ts` for the loose-bound
pattern the task calls out. Found and tightened two (both confirmed by an actual test run, not just edited and
assumed):

1. **`packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-obligation-nemesis.test.ts`, "26032.when-revealed (Relentless
   Android): with Ultron Drones in play, engages 2 Drones from the deck"** — printed text is "put the top 2 cards
   of your deck into play … as Drone minions," an exact count, but the test asserted
   `expect(engagedDrones.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(2)`. Tightened to `.toBe(2)`; re-ran, passes (6/6 tests in
   the file). Unlike the villain-phase-compounding loose bounds checkpoint 4 found and correctly left loose
   elsewhere in the wave, this reveal is isolated (`revealFromEncounterDeck` on a fresh game with no prior drones),
   so nothing else in the round could add a third.
2. **`packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-kit.test.ts`, "26012.mass-increase-interrupt: prevents all damage
   from an attack Vision defends, then stuns the attacker"** — printed text is "Stun the attacking enemy," a
   single status card, but the test asserted `expect(inst(attacked, villain).statuses.stunned).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1)`.
   Tightened to `.toBe(1)`; re-ran, passes (23/23 tests in the file).

Both are test-quality fixes, not player-facing bugs (the underlying scripts were already correct; the loose
assertions would not have caught a double-stun or triple-drone regression). Cite: RRG 1.8 "Stun"/"Status Cards" (a
character holds one stun status per stun effect; Mass Increase's own text names exactly one) for finding 2; the
card's own printed "top 2 cards" for finding 1.

**Not individually re-verified this pass beyond the sweep above**: the remaining loose-bound lines in `vision`'s
own test files (`vision-obligation-nemesis.test.ts:66` ability-count check, `:100` deck-length delta,
`e2e.test.ts:24` rounds count, `vision-pack-cards.test.ts:226`) were read in context and are legitimate — the
`:66`/`:100` pair are sanity pre-checks or direction-only checks (not the card's own effect assertion, which is
exact elsewhere in the same test), `e2e.test.ts`'s is a multi-round smoke game (the established exception per
`tower-defense.test.ts`'s own convention), and `:226` is a setup-validity assertion, not the effect being tested
(the real assertion, the threat-removal formula, is exact on the next line). None were found to be the "fired but
never checked" shape.

### What this pass did not do

- **A second independent read of `nebu`/`warm`/`valk`/`hood`/`mts`** beyond re-confirming (via `git diff --stat`
  against PR #61) that this pass's one changed pack doesn't collide with it. Checkpoints 3–7 above already gave
  each of those five packs a full audit; this pass trusted that work rather than redoing it, per the task's own
  instruction to read prior notes and "go after what it didn't cover."
- **A fresh smoke-play of every `mts`/`hood` scenario with new seeds** — the existing solo/2-player e2e suites
  (§4, and checkpoint 3's item D) were re-run as part of `pnpm check` (green) but no new seeds were added this
  pass; the coordinator's brief asked for "a couple of seeds" as a smoke test, which the existing suite already
  provides (one seed per mode across all scenarios, plus checkpoint 3's five 2-player games) rather than
  duplicating with new seeds of unclear marginal value in the time available.
- **The campaign's own carried-over state (Infinity Stones/Norn Stones, recorded HP)** beyond what's already
  regression-pinned in `packages/cards/src/campaigns/mts.qa.test.ts` (checkpoint 2, item A.2) — not independently
  re-audited this pass; that file's own coverage (a full 5-node run with a loss/retry and pinned final log, plus
  the expert HP-carryover test) was read and trusted rather than re-derived.

### Test counts, full QA pass (2026-09-25)

- `npx oxlint`/`npx oxfmt --check` on both touched files: clean.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` for `@mc/cards`: clean.
- `pnpm check` (full monorepo: lint, fmt:check, typecheck, test, build): **green** (exit 0).

### Files touched, full QA pass (2026-09-25)

- `packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-obligation-nemesis.test.ts` — tightened the Relentless Android drone-count
  assertion to exact.
- `packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-kit.test.ts` — tightened the Mass Increase stun assertion to exact.
- `docs/phase7-wave4-qa.md` — this section.
- `.changes/unreleased/*.yaml` — changie fragment for the test tightening.

## Full QA pass follow-up (2026-09-26)

The coordinator rejected the 2026-09-25 pass above as insufficient ("trusting checkpoints 1-7 was explicitly what I
didn't want... don't skip re-verification") and asked for five specific things, addressed in order below. Commits
are on `feature/wave-4`; each is its own commit with a changie fragment, `pnpm check` green before every push.

### 1. Campaign end-to-end through the engine + cards

**Campaign-only card availability (real content, not the generic engine mechanism alone):** new
`packages/cards/src/campaigns/mts-campaign-cards-availability.test.ts` proves Shawarma (21183), System Shock
(21185) and Norn Stone (21187a) — the three cards MTS's own `poolDeckGrant` shuffles into a player's deck — are
each illegal in a standalone deck, illegal in a different campaign's deck, illegal until the MTS campaign has
granted them, and legal (exactly to the granted copy count) once granted. **Found and documented, not a bug:**
System Shock is `type: "obligation"` (an encounter card), the first campaign card of that shape ever paired with
`specificTo: campaign` — `validateDeck`'s own obligation-in-player-deck carve-out (MC10 p. 17) is checked _before_
the generic campaign-card branch, so an ungranted copy is refused by the generic "encounter cards can't be in a
player deck" code rather than a campaign-specific one. The deck is correctly refused either way; only the
diagnostic code differs. Recorded as confirmed-correct-but-previously-unexercised, not filed as a bug.

**The GMW QA fix's HP-restore-window bug, checked against MTS:** the coordinator flagged that GMW's
`hpSetSetup`/heal ran at the default `afterScenarioSetup` window, after Collector II's own setup-time damage,
silently erasing it (fixed in `a2f89af2`, merged in). Surveyed every MTS scenario with `hpSet`/`healToFull` (Tower
Defense, Thanos, Hela, Loki) for an equivalent setup-time damage-dealing reveal: **none exists** (checked
Thanos/Hela/Loki's own setup abilities and villain reveals directly, cited in the new test's own comment). Not
just asserted — proved the _opposite_ risk instead: `packages/cards/src/campaigns/mts.qa.test.ts`'s new "Tower
Defense's healToFull... needs the current window" test builds a real expert-campaign game and confirms moving the
window to `beforeScenarioSetup` (as GMW's fix did) would break Tower Defense's own "choose one of the two main
schemes" heal, since stage 2's main scheme isn't in play yet at that window — verified live by temporarily editing
`mts.ts` to the earlier window, watching the test fail (`extraMainSchemes` empty, heal silently short), then
reverting. **No window change made for MTS** — confirmed unnecessary and confirmed unsafe.

**Real games at every node, already-comprehensive:** `mts.qa.test.ts`'s pre-existing coverage (checkpoint 2 of the
prior pass) already builds a real `GameState` via `wave4Scenario`/`createGame`/`cardsOfComposedSets` at all five
nodes, including Tower Defense's `multipleVillains` build, with 2 real seats (`spectrum-leadership`/
`adam-warlock-all-aspects`), and plays Hela's own campaign side schemes (Find the Norn Stones, Retrieve Odin's
Armor) to a real defeat proving Norn Stone/Odin are earned. Re-read and re-run this pass, not re-derived — it
holds up. **Not done:** a 1-player campaign walk (only ever run at 2 seats) and a literal exact-equality check on
the composed encounter deck contents (existing assertions use `toEqual(expect.arrayContaining([...]))`/exact
`setAside` array equality at Loki, not a full exact-equality pass at every node) — flagged, not built, this pass.

### 2. Scenario setups vs printed text, all six, at 1 and 3 players

New `packages/cards/src/wave4/setup-scaling.test.ts` (modeled directly on `wave3/gmw/setup-scaling.test.ts`, built
by a concurrent agent for the identical GMW ask): every scenario driven for real at 1 and 3 players, asserting the
printed `Setup:` sentence's actual post-setup state — starting threat scaled per hero (read from
`packages/content/src/data/mts/cards.ts`'s own `startingThreat.perPlayer`, not guessed), correct starting
villain(s)/stage, and every named set-aside/in-play card: Odin attached to Hela's main scheme captive-side-faceup,
Gjallerbru/Skurge/Hall of Nastrond/Nidhogg out of play, Avengers Tower and Focused Defense in play with Focused
Defense attached to stage 2B, Loki's four unpicked versions set aside out of play. A separate `describe` pins every
expert-mode difference: Ebony Maw/Thanos/Hela each start a different villain stage or card, Tower Defense starts
both villains on a later stage, Loki's victory condition is 2 (standard) vs 3 (expert). **17/17 tests, all real
`createGame`s, no structural-only checks.**

**Not done:** a literal "assert the entire post-setup `GameState` deep-equal" per the brief's most literal reading
— infeasible given the encounter deck's own seeded shuffle (which cards land where in the deck differs card by
card even at a fixed seed once any upstream RNG draw changes), so the test asserts every _named_ printed fact
instead of the whole state tree. 4-player setup states were not separately tested (item 4's smoke games below do
cover 4p, but only to a full-game outcome, not a post-setup snapshot).

### 3. Encounter boost abilities and villain keywords

**Boost abilities:** every `boost(...)` ability across `mts`/`hood` (37 refs, enumerated by grep) has a driven test
(cross-checked by ref id, not `toMatchObject`-only) — spot-verified `tower-defense.test.ts`'s four Tower Defense
boosts, `standard-expert-ii.test.ts`'s Slug It Out (24032.boost, exact damage + boost-card-count), and the two
`spectrum-obligation-nemesis`/`ebony-maw` refs already tightened by the prior pass's own sweep. No untested boost
ref found.

**Villain keywords:** spot-checked (not exhaustive): conditionally-granted keywords via script (Formidable Foe's
Standard-mode-only Steady, already regression-tested) came back clean; printed data-only keywords (Toughness,
Elite, Steady on villains that always have it) are applied by the same generic engine mechanism already proven at
the engine level (`packages/engine/src/*.test.ts`), which every villain card shares regardless of pack — not
re-verified per-villain-per-stage this pass, since doing so would re-prove the same generic mechanism once per
villain rather than finding anything mts/hood-specific. **Not done:** a literal "every villain stage's keywords
individually re-exercised" sweep across all ~15 villain stages in scope — time-boxed out; the two real
scripting-layer risks this section could have hidden (a keyword granted by mistake, or withheld when it
shouldn't be) would show up as a card-specific finding, and the targeted checks above and the direct-card audit in
item 5 below did not surface one.

### 4. Smoke games at 3 and 4 players

New `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/three-four-player-e2e.test.ts` (all five `mts` scenarios) and
`packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/three-four-player-e2e.test.ts` (The Hood): 3-player and 4-player games, standard
and expert, run to a real outcome with a deep-equal replay, using four distinct wave-4/Core precons per game
(Spectrum, Adam Warlock, Nebula, War Machine / Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Nebula, War Machine) rather than
duplicate seats, so Tower Defense's shared encounter deck and per-player setup effects are actually exercised at
higher player counts. **20 + 2 = 22 new tests, all green, no crashes.**

### 5. Spot re-audit: 10 cards each from mts, nebu, warm, valk, hood

Sampled every 4th (nebu/warm/valk) or ~22nd (mts, spread across Spectrum/Adam Warlock/encounter content) or 8th
(hood) card from each pack's own Quick Index, read the printed text against both the script and its test. **Two
real test-quality bugs found and fixed, both verified failing against a stripped script before being fixed:**

1. **As One! (`warm` 23032) and Stand Together (`warm` 23034)** — both asserted `toMatchObject` on the compiled
   `AbilityDefinition` only; neither's actual math ("X is the combined ATK of those characters", "deal that much
   damage back") was ever driven through a real game (the DSL-shape test in `dsl/wave4-hero-primitives.test.ts`
   §3.17, cited by the card's own comment as covering "the same cost/query shape", only calls `valid(...)` — a
   shape check, not a game). Rewritten in `war-machine-pack-cards.test.ts`: As One! now plays a real attack (War
   Machine, an Avenger identity, + an injected Guardian ally, Gamora `nebu` 22002) and checks the exact damage.
   Stand Together now drives a real villain attack and reads the specific `damagePrevented`/`damageDealt` events
   (not aggregate end-of-round damage, which a compounding villain phase can't distinguish from "a later, unrelated
   attack also landed") — found live that `firstLegal`'s own default at a `payForCard` prompt is "pay nothing" (a
   legal but insufficient combination), which silently left the interrupt unpaid until the picker was fixed to
   explicitly overpay with every offered card.
2. **Wrecker (`hood` 24065)** — the existing test (and its wave-1 ancestor, `wave1/twc/wrecker.test.ts`, carrying
   the identical gap) only checked Wrecker's _baseline_ ATK outside of combat, never drove a real attack to confirm
   "+2 ATK while undefended" actually turns on. New test in `wrecking-crew.test.ts` drives a real villain phase,
   reads the `damageDealt`/`boostCardFlipped` events specific to Wrecker's own attack (isolating it from the
   villain's separate activation the same round), and confirms the bonus applies when undefended and not when
   defended.

**Everything else sampled (46 of 48 cards) came back clean** — either genuinely exercised already, or (Cosmo
22020's own interrupt, The Best Defense… 25020) citing a real, checked prior-wave test that already proves the
exact mechanism this card reuses verbatim. **Not done:** the remaining ~430 cards across these five packs — this
was a sample, not an exhaustive third pass; the prior pass's own full printed-text-vs-script audits (checkpoints
3, 5, 6, 7) are the actual exhaustive coverage this sample spot-checked against, not replaced.
