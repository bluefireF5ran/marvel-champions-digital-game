# Phase 7 working spec: wave 4 (cycle 3)

This is the shared brief for every agent working Phase 7's fourth content wave:

- `card-data-pipeline`, `game-rules-architect`, `ability-scripting-engineer`, `encounter-ai-designer`, `rules-qa-engineer`
  and `game-client-engineer`.
- It turns wave 4's scope into schema decisions (§1), per-pack setup needs (§2), and a prioritized list of engine
  primitives (§3), each with a status.
- The models are `docs/phase7-wave1.md`, `docs/phase7-wave2.md` and `docs/phase7-wave3.md`, whose §3 primitives are
  assumed. The definition of done is `docs/wave-definition-of-done.md`: **the box's campaign ships in this wave.** If
  you change a decision here, update this file in the same change.

**Wave 4** is cycle 3, The Mad Titan's Shadow. RRG 1.8 Appendix VI (p. 71) lists its wave 4 as "The Mad Titan's Shadow
campaign expansion, the Nebula Hero Pack, the War Machine Hero Pack, the Valkyrie Hero Pack, and the Vision Hero Pack".
The Hood, a scenario pack with no player cards, is released in the same window. In release order (Hall of Heroes dates;
`docs/phase7-wave4-sources.md` §1):

| Pack     | Product                       | Released     | State today                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `nebu`   | Nebula hero pack              | Sep 17, 2021 | emitted, data only                                |
| `mts`    | The Mad Titan's Shadow (MC21) | Oct 29, 2021 | **not emitted** (§1, 26 survey lines)             |
| `warm`   | War Machine hero pack         | Nov 12, 2021 | emitted, data only                                |
| `hood`   | The Hood scenario pack        | Nov 26, 2021 | **scripted** (2026-09-25; §2.3, e2e)              |
| `vision` | Vision hero pack              | Jan 14, 2022 | emitted, data only; **Dense face missing** (§1.2) |
| `valk`   | Valkyrie hero pack            | Jan 21, 2022 | emitted, data only                                |

- **The brief's order was `mts, nebu, warm, hood, valk, vision`.** By the dates, Nebula precedes the box (its Aug 27 US
  release slipped to Oct 29) and Vision precedes Valkyrie. Nothing here depends on the order; the box is still first
  in priority (§3).
- **The box's content** (MC21 p. 2): Spectrum, Adam Warlock, five scenarios (Ebony Maw, Tower Defense, Thanos, Hela,
  Loki), modular sets (Black Order, Armies of Titan, Children of Thanos, Infinity Gauntlet, Legions of Hel, Frost
  Giants, Enchantress) and The Mad Titan's Shadow Campaign set (cards 180–193).
- **The Hood** has no "Ghost Rider" set. Its sets are The Hood, nine modulars (Beasty Boys, Brothers Grimm, Crossfire's
  Crew, Mister Hyde, Ransacked Armory, Sinister Syndicate, State of Emergency, Streets of Mayhem, Wrecking Crew) and the
  Standard II / Expert II difficulty sets.

Authorities, in the order they win (RRG 1.8 "The Golden Rules", p. 4: card text and scenario rules beat the Rules
Reference; FFG rulings clarify both):

1. **Card text and product rules.** The Mad Titan's Shadow rulebook (MC21) is

## 1. Schema decisions (owner: `game-rules-architect`)

> Status: **landed (2026-09-24)** in `packages/content/src/schema/**`, with fixtures in
> `packages/content/src/schema/wave4.test.ts` (16 tests) and `packages/engine/src/max-copies-per-title.test.ts` (3
> tests, `validateDeck` enforcing §1.4). New: `KeywordInstance form`, `IdentityDeckbuilding.maxCopiesPerTitle`,
> `MainSchemeStage.villainOf`, `MultipleVillains.encounterDecks: "shared"`, `BaseCard.otherFaceId`, `ModeOnly` /
> `modeOnly`, `EncounterSet.classification` / `separateDecks` / `singleVillainOnly` (and `validateEncounterSet`),
> `ScenarioSeparateDeck.contents.trait` and `cardType: "environment"` (the engine's `buildScenarioDeck` reads both),
> `Scenario.startingVillain` / `victoryCondition` / `setAsideModularSetCount`. No emitted card changed; every pack still
> validates. **Data only until §3:** `encounterDecks: "shared"`, `otherFaceId`, `modeOnly`, `separateDecks` on a set,
> `startingVillain`, `victoryCondition` and `setAsideModularSetCount` are not read by the engine yet, so no scenario
> using them may be marked playable before its §3 section lands. `maxCopiesPerTitle` and the form keyword's validation
> are enforced now.

**The survey** (`scripts/marvelcdb/survey.ts --pack mts nebu warm hood valk vision`, 2026-09-24): `nebu`, `warm`, `hood`,
`valk` and `vision` normalize cleanly; `mts` has 26 lines (dash costs 3, attach rules 6, unlinked records 8, side
schemes with foreign backs 3, missing art 4, a boost star 1, "not this set's villain" 1). "Clean" is not "right":
§1.1, §1.2 and §1.8 are data errors in packs that survey clean.

> **Pipeline status: landed (card-data-pipeline, 2026-09-24).** `mts` is emitted (`packages/content/src/data/mts/**`,
> curation in `curation/mts.ts`, registered in `ingest-marvelcdb.ts`), wired into `DATA_ONLY_CARDS`/
> `DATA_ONLY_ENCOUNTER_SETS` (`data/index.ts`), 191 cards from 202 raw records (9 dropped aggregates, the normal
> shape — see each subsection below for the per-issue fix and §1's own new field, `artUnavailable`, which the
> 26-line survey didn't anticipate). Every other pack still normalizes cleanly (`pnpm --filter @mc/content ingest --
> --all --dry-run --offline` unaffected). Both box precons (Spectrum, Adam Warlock) validate under `validateDeck`/
> `requiredIdentitySet` (`packages/cards/src/wave4-precon-legality.test.ts`, 29 tests). The five scenarios and
> `MTS_CAMPAIGN` (`data/mts/campaign.ts`, the `gmw`/`trors` shape) are data; none is playable yet (§3's own gate).
>
> **One further schema-adjacent gap found and closed in this pass, not in the original 26-line list:**
> `PackCuration.artUnavailable` (`curation/types.ts`) — six MarvelCDB records (`21136b`, `21137b`, Hela's own hidden
> linked back faces, and four campaign-card backs: `21182b`, `21184b`, `21186b`, `21189b`) have no artwork reference
> anywhere on MarvelCDB (checked on the live API, not just the cached raw file) and no independently-viewable second
> source could be found either. Rather than block the whole box on six of 202 records, `checkCoverage` (`normalize/
> checks.ts`) now honors a per-code, per-reason exemption instead of hard-failing, resolved via a new
> `NormalizeContext.faceCodesByCardId` map (populated explicitly in `normalize/villains.ts` for every villain
> shape, and automatically for any single-record card, whose one face is always its own code) — mirrors the stale-
> `imageOverrides` check both ways (errors on an unmatched entry, and on an entry that matches a face that already
> has art). The client's existing missing-art fallback (`packages/client/src/art/art-source.ts`'s `artFor` returning
> `null`, `card-art.ts`'s `request` treating that as "no texture") already draws a generated frame for exactly this
> shape — proven for a villain stage specifically by a new case in `art-source.test.ts`. See `curation/mts.ts`'s own
> header comment and its `artUnavailable` entries for the search each of the six documents.

### 1.1 The form keyword: "Energy form." / "Mass form." (`KeywordInstance form`)

RRG 1.8 "Form, Change Form" (p. 21): "Cards with the '[type] form' keyword grant an identity unique forms." MC21 p. 2
calls them "Additional Forms". So "Energy form." is a keyword with a parameter, not an ability.

- **New `KeywordInstance { name: "form"; formType: string }`**, `formType` lower case: "Energy form." → `"energy"`
  (Gamma, Photon, Pulsar, `mts` 21002–21004), "Mass form." → `"mass"` (Intangible/Dense, `vision` 26002; Solid/Phased,
  `mut_gen` 32031a/b), "Suit form." → `"suit"` (Assault/Stealth, `aos` 50035a/b).
- **Parser (pipeline):** a leading `"<Word> form."` sentence becomes the keyword. Today it becomes the first
  "-constant" ref (`26002.intangible-constant`), which no script can fill.

### 1.2 Vision's Dense face is dropped (data bug)

`vision` 26002 is one double-sided upgrade: raw `double_sided: true`, `back_name: "Dense"`, `back_text: "Mass form.
Permanent. While in hero form, Vision gets +2 ATK and +2 DEF. Response: After you change to this mass form, draw 1
card."`, `backimagesrc`. The normalizer reads `back_*` only for encounter cards, so the emitted card has no `flipSide`
and Vision can never be Dense. It is the only emitted player card with a `back_text` (checked across every raw pack).
**Pipeline:** emit `flipSide` from the `back_*` fields for player cards (`PlayerCardCommon.flipSide` exists, wave 2
§1.5), with `form` keywords on both faces (§1.1).

### 1.3 Spectrum's energy forms print a dash cost

Gamma, Photon and Pulsar (21002–21004) have no raw `cost`. The printed card (Gamma, `marvelcdb.com/bundles/cards/21002.png`,
viewed in a scratch folder and not stored) shows "—". So `cost: 0, specialCost: "dash"` (wave 2 §1.3; RRG 1.8 "Dash
(Value)", p. 15: it "cannot be played and can only enter play through other means"). The same card prints "After you
change to this **energy** form", where raw reads "this form": a curation correction for all three.

### 1.4 Adam Warlock's deckbuilding (`IdentityDeckbuilding.maxCopiesPerTitle`)

Adam Warlock (21031b), Avatar of Life: "During deck-building, your deck must include an equal number of cards from all 4
aspects. You cannot include more than 1 copy of any non-Adam Warlock card." MC21 p. 3: "he cannot include more than one
copy of any aspect card in his deck" and "his pre-built deck includes many powerful cards that are unique or 'Max 1
per deck'" (the precon includes a basic card, Martinex, once).

- The first sentence is the existing `aspectCount: 4` and `equalCardsPerAspect: true` (the Spider-Woman fields).
- **New `IdentityDeckbuilding.maxCopiesPerTitle?: number`**: every card outside the identity's own set is limited to
  that many copies by title, aspect and basic alike. `validateDeck` reports `deck_limit` past it.
- **Data:** 21031a gets `{ aspectCount: 4, equalCardsPerAspect: true, maxCopiesPerTitle: 1 }`.

### 1.5 A main scheme that belongs to a villain: `MainSchemeStage.villainOf`

Tower Defense's two main schemes print "Proxima Midnight's Scheme." (21098b) and "Corvus Glaive's Scheme." (21099b).
MC21 p. 10: "Stage 1B is identified as Proxima Midnight's scheme, and stage 2B is identified as Corvus Glaive's
scheme. When either of the two villains schemes, place the threat on their matching main scheme card only." The
main-scheme sibling of `SideSchemeCard.signatureOf` ("Wrecker's Side Scheme.").

- **New `MainSchemeStage.villainOf?: string`**, the villain's title. The sentence needs no ability ref.

### 1.6 Two villains sharing one encounter deck: `MultipleVillains.encounterDecks: "shared"`

The Wrecking Crew (`MultipleVillains`, wave 1 §1.1) gives each villain its own encounter deck. Tower Defense has one
("Encounter Deck: Tower Defense, Armies of Titan, and Standard sets", MC21 p. 10), two villains, one active villain.

- **`MultipleVillains.encounterDecks` gains `"shared"`**; with it `ScenarioVillain.encounterSetIds` may be empty and the
  scenario's own `encounterSetIds` build the one deck. `activation: "activeVillainOnly"` and `winCondition:
  "allVillainsDefeated"` are unchanged. Which villain is active is Focused Defense's rule (§3.2), not data.
- **Parser:** "Attach to Corvus Glaive." (21104) failed because the set has two villains; it is `AttachmentHost
  { kind: "namedVillain", name }`, which exists.
- **Status (card-data-pipeline, 2026-09-25):** fixed upstream. `normalizeVillains` (`villains.ts`) treated Proxima
  Midnight I/II/III and Corvus Glaive I/II/III as one "colliding stage numbers" set the Once and Future Kang's
  branching-stage-II shape and The Sinister Six's six-independent-villains shape already use (wave 2 §1.8) — every
  record split into its own one-stage `VillainCard` (21092–21094, 21095–21097 apiece), because the normalizer had no
  way to tell "several distinct single-stage villains" apart from "two villains that each advance stage-to-stage
  sharing one set". Fixed by grouping colliding records by title (the roman numeral stripped) first: if more than one
  group results and every group's own stage numbers are a complete, gapless run starting at 1, each group becomes its
  own multi-stage `VillainCard` (Tower Defense: two 3-stage cards, ids 21092/21095); Kang's groups have a gap (`{I,
  III}` skipping the branching II) and Sinister Six's are trivially single-stage, so both fall through to the
  unchanged per-record behavior. Re-emitted `mts` only (`pnpm --filter @mc/content ingest -- --pack mts --offline`):
  `packages/content/src/data/mts/cards.ts` now emits 21092 and 21095 as three-stage villains (21093/21094/21096/21097
  folded in as `sides[0].stages[1]`/`[2]`, ability refs unchanged since they're keyed by each stage's own printed
  code); `provenance.ts`'s two `CardProvenance` records gained the folded-in `marvelcdbCodes`. No other card, pack, or
  scenario record changed. `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/villain-merge.ts` (the scripting workaround) is deleted;
  `tower-defense-setup.ts` reads `WAVE4_CARDS` directly and looks up 21092/21095 by id, `tower-defense.ts`'s docblock
  no longer mentions the merge, and `tower-defense.test.ts` names the two ids directly instead of importing the
  merged cards. All 29 Tower Defense tests pass unchanged in what they assert.

### 1.7 A card whose faces are two separately emitted cards: `BaseCard.otherFaceId`

Five campaign side schemes print "When Defeated: … Flip this card over." with a back of another card: Secure the
Landing Pad → Cosmo (ally, 21180a/b), Save the Shawarma Place → Black Swan (minion, 21182a/b), Open the Dungeons →
Jormungand (attachment, 21189a/b); Hack Sanctuary's Computer → Defensive Protocols and Find the Norn Stones → Retrieve
Odin's Armor (side schemes, 21184a/b, 21186a/b). `SideSchemeCard` has no `flipSide`, and a `CardFlipSide` cannot carry
another card type's stats. Wave 3 §1.4 already emits a side scheme's two faces as two cards (16178a/b), with no link.

- **New `BaseCard.otherFaceId?: CardId`**, set on both faces, naming the other. Emitting each face with its own type
  keeps every face's schema exact (Cosmo is a real `AllyCard` with `specificTo: campaign`).
- The engine flips such a card by replacing the instance's card with the other face (§3.10): RRG 1.8 "Flip" (p. 20),
  "A different card type from the previous face, all attached cards, tucked cards, status cards, and tokens are
  discarded from the card." A double-sided card never goes to a discard pile (RRG 1.8 "Double-Sided Card", p. 17).
- **Pipeline:** emit `otherFaceId` on 21180a/b, 21182a/b, 21184a/b, 21186a/b, 21189a/b, and back-fill wave 3's 16178a/b–
  16182a/b (their faces are chosen by mode, not flipped, but they are one card).

### 1.8 "Standard Mode Only" / "Expert Mode Only" faces: `modeOnly`

RRG 1.8 "Double-Sided Card" (p. 17): "If a double-sided card has 'Standard Mode Only' and 'Expert Mode Only' sides, it
is put into play with the 'Expert Mode Only' side faceup if the players are playing expert mode." Formidable Foe (`hood`
24049a/b) is emitted with the sentence as ability refs (`24049a.formidable-foe-constant`), so the engine cannot read it.

- **New `modeOnly?: "standard" | "expert"`** on `EncounterCardCommon` and `CardFlipSide`. The sentence needs no ref.
- Seventeen raw cards print it: `hood` 24049a/b, `gmw` 16178a/b–16182a/b (wave 3 §1.4's split side schemes, which may
  carry it too), `sm` 27174a/b, `next_evol` 40081a/b.
- **Status (card-data-pipeline, 2026-09-25):** back-filled onto `gmw`'s five `SideSchemeCard`s (16178a/b–16182a/b;
  `SideSchemeCard.modeOnly`, mirroring `EncounterCardCommon.modeOnly`) and onto `otherFaceId` for the same five pairs
  (§1.7's own back-fill, since a mode-only face is also "the other face of one physical card"). Re-emitting `gmw`
  (only; `mts` was re-emitted separately for §1.6) turned each card's "Standard/Expert Mode Only." sentence from an
  ability ref into data, which deleted the ten now-empty `*-constant` refs `gmw/campaign-challenge.ts` registered
  purely to hold that sentence (`16178a.badoon-blitz-constant` etc., the `wave1/twc/breakout.ts` "printed text, no
  behavior" shape) — every one of them was already a no-op `constant()` with nothing else in its stage's text, so
  the fix is deleting the refs from the script (not moving them to new ids: there is no new sentence needing one).
  Kree Supremacy's two faces (16182a/16182b, which print no `When Defeated:`) now register no ability ref at all.
  `campaign-challenge.ts` and its test are updated in the same commit; `campaign-challenge.test.ts` now asserts
  `modeOnly` directly off `GMW_CARDS` instead of naming the deleted refs, and its `When Defeated:`/campaign-reveal
  tests are unchanged in what they assert. No other pack was re-emitted.

### 1.9 Standard II and Expert II: `EncounterSet.classification`

RRG 1.8 "Standard Set" (p. 40): "The standard set is not a modular encounter set and cannot be selected (by the players
or randomly) when a scenario requires players to choose a modular encounter set", and "Cards in the 'Standard'
classification are any cards that have the word 'Standard' printed by the bottom of the card". "Expert Set" (p. 19)
likewise. Standard II and Expert II print "Standard II" / "Expert II", so they are that classification.

- **New `EncounterSet.classification?: "standard" | "expert"`**: such a set is never a modular choice
  (`validateScenario`, and The Hood's "Choose 7 modular encounter sets"). Emit it on `standard_ii`, `expert_ii`, and on
  Core's `standard` and `expert` for uniformity.
- Whether a game uses Standard II instead of or beside Standard is a setup choice the insert states (§4 Q5): instead,
  optionally, each independently. The scenario's `standardEncounterSetIds` is unchanged; `difficultyEncounterSetIds`
  substitutes the chosen set at build time.

### 1.10 A modular set that brings its own deck: `EncounterSet.separateDecks`

MC21 p. 16: "When using the Infinity Gauntlet set in a scenario, attach the Infinity Gauntlet attachment card to the
villain during setup. If there is more than one villain (or no villain) in play at the start of the game, The Infinity
Gauntlet set cannot be used. After attaching the Infinity Gauntlet to the villain, shuffle the six Infinity Stone
environment cards together and set them aside, facedown. This is the 'Infinity Stone deck.' The Infinity Stone deck
has its own discard pile. […] If the Infinity Stone deck is ever empty, shuffle the Infinity Stone deck discard pile
back into the Infinity Stone deck. There is no built-in penalty for doing this." The set "may be used in other
scenarios", so the deck belongs to the set, not to Thanos's or Loki's `Scenario`.

- **New `EncounterSet.separateDecks?: readonly ScenarioSeparateDeck[]`**, built at setup whenever the set is in the
  game. `ScenarioSeparateDeck.contents` gains `trait?: Trait` (Infinity Stone) beside `cardType`, whose union widens to
  `"side_scheme" | "environment"`.
- **New `EncounterSet.singleVillainOnly?: true`**: `validateScenario` and setup refuse the set with `multipleVillains`.
- Infinity Gauntlet set: `separateDecks: [{ name: "Infinity Stone", contents: { encounterSetIds: [infinity_gauntlet],
  trait: INFINITY_STONE }, discardPile: "own", whenEmpty: "reshuffleDiscardWithoutPenalty" }]`.

### 1.11 Loki: a random starting villain and a victory count

MC21 p. 24: "choose one Loki villain card at random, reveal it and put it into play. Set the remaining four versions of
Loki aside", and "The number of different versions of Loki that must be defeated is determined by the players before
the game begins. […] Rookie Mode – One version of Loki; Standard Mode – Two versions; Expert Mode – Three versions;
Heroic Mode – Four versions." 21165b: "If the number of Lokis in the victory display is equal to the victory condition,
the players win the game."

- **New `Scenario.startingVillain?: "random"`**: the villain put into play at setup is chosen with the game's seeded
  RNG from `villainCardId` and `setAsideVillainCardIds`; the rest are set aside. Each Loki is its own one-stage
  `VillainCard` (five titles "Loki", the Kang shape).
- **New `Scenario.victoryCondition?: { standard: number; expert: number; skirmish?: number; heroic?: number }`**,
  read by the new `ValueSpec victoryCondition` (§3.7). Loki: `{ skirmish: 1, standard: 2, expert: 3, heroic: 4 }`.
- `victory: "cardAbility"`: defeating a final villain stage does not win; the stage's `stateCheck` does.

### 1.12 The Hood's set-aside modular sets: `Scenario.setAsideModularSetCount`

Making Connections 1A (24004a): "Choose 7 modular encounter sets and set them aside (you may choose randomly). Choose 1
of those sets at random, then shuffle it into the encounter deck." Mojo's Wheel of Genres reads "set-aside modular
encounter sets" too (`mojo` 39026a/b).

- **New `Scenario.setAsideModularSetCount?: number`**: that many modular sets are chosen at setup and put in
  `encounterSetAside`, grouped by set. `modularSetCount` is 0 for The Hood; the 1A `Setup:` shuffles one in (§3.18).

### 1.13 Other data notes for the pipeline

- **Errata to apply** (RRG 1.8 p. 67): Sanctuary (21116), Infinity Gauntlet (21129; raw lacks "Attach to the villain",
  and its "Setup [star]" is a formatting break), Eros (22011), Cosmo (22020; raw already current), Old Rivals (22031),
  James Rhodes (23001b), Aragorn (25007), Shieldmaiden (25011; Defense trait), Beguiled (25031; Condition trait),
  Machine Man (26022). The rulebook errata (MC21 p. 10) is scenario rules, applied in §3.2.
- **Attach rules the parser missed:** Restrained 21083 "Attach to a friendly character with the highest ATK and exhaust
  it." → `superlative { among: "friendlyCharacter", order: "highest", measure: "atk" }` plus the "exhaust it" ref;
  Focused Defense 21101 → `mainScheme` (put into play by 2A); Fallen Warrior 21153 → `ally` (put into play by its own
  When Revealed); Frozen 21158 prints "Attack to your identity" in raw, a typo for "Attach" (check the image).
- **Rain Fire 21109:** raw `boost_star: false` but its text has a Boost ability; confirm the star from the image.
- **Encounter allies.** Odin (21139a/b; Captive / King faces of one ally, `flipSide`) is a scenario-specific ally like
  Taskmaster's captives (`specificTo: { kind: "scenario" }`). Cosmo 21180b and the four Captive allies 21190–21193 are
  `specificTo: { kind: "campaign" }`.
- **Campaign cards (180–193)** are emitted with the box: `specificTo: campaign` on player cards, `campaignSpecific` on
  "The Mad Titan's Shadow Campaign" set. MC21 p. 4: "Cards 180–193 … cannot be included in any deck unless playing The
  Mad Titan's Shadow campaign and the players were directed to add them".
- **Cycle id.** `nebu`, `warm`, `hood`, `valk` and `vision` use `cycle: { id: "cycle4", name: "Cycle 4", order: 4 }`,
  following MarvelCDB's `pack_wave: 4`. `mts` joins them; the name may become "The Mad Titan's Shadow" for all six, as
  `stld` did for cycle 2 (a label, not a disagreement with FFG's numbering).

### 1.14 Keywords

Cycle 3 prints **Alliance** and **Steady** for the first time and introduces the **form** keyword (§1.1); everything
else is older. MC21 p. 13's "Important Keywords" list is a reminder list, not new keywords
(`docs/phase7-wave4-sources.md` §2.2).

| Keyword  | Printed forms                                          | Cards                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Form     | "Energy form." / "Mass form."                          | 21002–21004; 26002 (both faces)                              |
| Alliance | "Alliance." (with reminder text on some)               | 23032, 23034, 25033, 25036, 26035 (and 9 later-pack cards)   |
| Steady   | "The Hood gains … steady"; "Each enemy gains steady"   | 24008, 24049a/b, 24063 (granted; the engine implements it)   |
| Victory  | "Victory N." on side schemes, minions and **villains** | 21116, 21140–21145, Loki 21160–21164, campaign cards         |
| Hinder   | "Hinder 1[per_hero]." / "Hinder 2[per_hero]."          | 21110, 21116, 21140–21142, 21166–21169, 22… (all per player) |

## 2. Per-pack setup needs, standalone and campaign

RRG 1.8 Appendix II (p. 51) with the wave 1–3 engine. Step 13, "Campaign Setup", is used only in campaign mode.

### 2.1 Hero packs

- **Same title, different cards:** Gamora the ally (22002) and the nemesis minion (22028, "discard the Gamora ally from
  play"); the Enchantress minion in `valk` and in `mts`'s Enchantress modular (25029 / 21177); Cosmo (22020, the `stld`
  reprint) and the campaign Cosmo (21180b); Avengers Tower support (21020) and environment (21100a/b, "The unique rule
  does not apply to Avengers Tower", MC21 p. 11); Corvus Glaive / Proxima Midnight / Ebony Maw as villains and as
  Children of Thanos minions.
- **Precons.** Only the box's two are printed in the repo (MC21 p. 3). The four hero packs' come from their inserts.
- **Status (card-data-pipeline, 2026-09-24):** both `mts` precons emitted (`spectrum-leadership`, `adam-warlock-all-
  aspects`, `curation/mts.ts`'s `starterDecks`), verified legal (`wave4-precon-legality.test.ts`). Spectrum's own
  printed lists (MC21 p. 3) sum to 43 cards, not 40 — transcribed verbatim rather than force-fit, flagged in §4.
  Adam Warlock's `21031a` carries `{ aspectCount: 4, equalCardsPerAspect: true, maxCopiesPerTitle: 1 }` (§1.4).

### 2.2 The Mad Titan's Shadow scenarios

Villain decks are I–II standard and II–III expert, except Hela (one card per mode, wave 3 §1.1) and Loki (five
stage-I cards, §1.11).

| Scenario      | Main scheme deck                                          | Encounter sets (required) + modulars                                 | 1A Setup / scenario rules                                                                                                                                                             | Needs (§3)                                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Ebony Maw     | Attack on Knowhere → The Power Stone (2B loses)           | Ebony Maw, Standard; Black Order, Armies of Titan                    | 1B: each player discards from the encounter deck until a Spell and puts it into play in their play area.                                                                              | §3.15, §3.16, §3.20                         |
| Tower Defense | Under Siege 1 and The Armies of Thanos 2 **both in play** | Tower Defense, Standard; Armies of Titan                             | "Reveal stage 2A and put it into play next to this stage so there are two main schemes and two villains in play." Avengers Tower, Focused Defense.                                    | §3.2, §3.3, §3.4, §3.5                      |
| Thanos        | The Infinity Stones → Balance the Scales (2A loses)       | Thanos, Infinity Gauntlet, Standard; Black Order, Children of Thanos | 1B: top card of the Infinity Stone deck into play; reveal Sanctuary.                                                                                                                  | §3.6, §3.11, "from player cards" damage     |
| Hela          | Odin's Torment (single stage)                             | Hela, Standard; Legions of Hel, Frost Giants                         | "Attach Odin to the main scheme, captive side faceup. Reveal Gnipahellir and Garm. Set Gjallerbru, Skurge, Hall of Nastrond, and Nidhogg aside."                                      | §3.8, §3.9; ∞ villain (landed, wave 3 §3.1) |
| Loki          | All Hail King Loki (single stage)                         | Loki, Infinity Gauntlet, Standard; Enchantress, Frost Giants         | "Set each copy of the Loki villain aside … Put the War in Asgard side scheme into play. … Reveal 1 set-aside Loki villain at random. Reveal the top card of the infinity stone deck." | §3.6, §3.7, §3.9                            |

- **Modular sets** (MC21 pp. 6, 10, 16, 20, 24): Black Order, Armies of Titan, Children of Thanos, Infinity Gauntlet
  (single-villain scenarios only), Legions of Hel, Frost Giants, Enchantress.
- **Tower Defense's optional setup damage** on Avengers Tower (1/2/3 per player by difficulty, MC21 p. 11) is a
  suggested difficulty option, not a rule. Built 2026-09-25 as `ScenarioSetupOptions.towerDefenseSetupDamage`, off by
  default (§4 Q4).

**Status (card-data-pipeline, 2026-09-24):** all five emitted as `Scenario` records (`curation/mts.ts`'s own
`evidence` field cites the exact printed sentence per scenario) and importable (`MTS_SCENARIOS`), data-only per
§1's own status note (none is playable until its §3 primitives land).

- `ebony-maw`: `villainSetCode: "ebony_maw"`, `modularSetCount: 2`, ordinary single-villain shape.
- `tower-defense`: `multipleVillains.villainCardCodes: ["21092", "21095"]` (Proxima Midnight I, Corvus Glaive I) —
  needed because both villains share one `card_set_code` (`tower_defense`) with colliding stage numbers, the same
  shape `normalizeVillains` already gives Kang/Sinister Six, so `villainSetCodes` alone can't disambiguate them
  (§1.6's own new `MultipleVillainsCuration.villainCardCodes` field). `encounterDecks: "shared"`.
- `thanos`: `additionalEncounterSetCodes: ["infinity_gauntlet"]`; the Infinity Stone deck itself is on the
  `infinity_gauntlet` `EncounterSet`, not this scenario (§1.10).
- `hela`: `villainCardCode: "21136a"` (the A1/standard face, wave 3 §1.1's mode+face shape), `villainStages: {
  standard: [1, 1], expert: [1, 1] }`.
- `loki`: `villainCardCode: "21160"`, `setAsideVillainCardCodes: ["21161", "21162", "21163", "21164"]`,
  `startingVillain: "random"`, `victoryCondition: { skirmish: 1, standard: 2, expert: 3, heroic: 4 }`,
  `victory: "cardAbility"` (§1.11).

#### Campaign (MC21 pp. 4, 7, 13, 17, 21, 25)

`packages/cards/src/campaigns/mts.gate.test.ts` wrote MC21 against the frozen campaign foundation with synthetic ids
and found it fits. Checked against the real cards:

| Scenario      | Campaign setup                                                                                                           | Campaign victory                                                                                         | What the real cards add                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ebony Maw     | Secure the Landing Pad into play; Security Breach shuffled in                                                            | Cosmo if Secure the Landing Pad was defeated; Security Breach if 1B completed; HP (expert)               | Secure the Landing Pad flips into the Cosmo ally (§1.7, §3.10). Security Breach puts a random hand card facedown on itself.                                                       |
| Tower Defense | Save the Shawarma Place into play; Security Breach if pooled; HP; token heal on **one of** the main schemes              | Shawarma; Black Swan if not in the victory display; Avengers Tower Damaged; HP                           | Save the Shawarma Place flips into the Black Swan minion (§3.10), which "engages the first player".                                                                               |
| Thanos        | Hack Sanctuary's Computer; Cosmo, Security Breach, Shawarma, Black Swan if pooled; HP; 3 damage if the Tower was Damaged | System Shock if Defensive Protocols not in the victory display; Infinity Stones 1B completed             | Hack Sanctuary's Computer flips into Defensive Protocols (a side scheme, §3.10).                                                                                                  |
| Hela          | Find the Norn Stones; Summoned Back; Shawarma, System Shock if pooled; discard half deck if 1B completed                 | Norn Stone if Find the Norn Stones was defeated; Odin if Retrieve Odin's Armor is in the victory display | Find the Norn Stones flips into Retrieve Odin's Armor. System Shock needs an ability active in hand (§3.13) and "You cannot choose to discard this card from your hand" (§3.13).  |
| Loki          | Open the Dungeons; Summoned Back; pooled cards; Norn Stone on its Setup side; Odin on his King side                      | Campaign won; expert: losing loses the campaign                                                          | Open the Dungeons flips into Jormungand ("Attach to Loki", +4[per_hero] hit points). Odin's King side is his back face (21139b): the gate's modeling choice 6 needs a `flipCard`. |

- **Expert campaign** (MC21 p. 25): record remaining hit points capped at base; heal to full by an acceleration token;
  "If a player is defeated during a scenario that their teammates go on to win, the defeated player does not
  participate in any of the victory steps for that scenario. However, they can rejoin their teammates for the next
  scenario by placing an acceleration token on the main scheme." A defeated player's hit points are recorded as 0, and
  since 2026-09-25 (§4 Q6) an identity recorded at 0 must take the heal: only a player above 0 may decline it.
- **Beyond the frozen foundation**, the campaign needs only card-level primitives: §3.10 (faces of different types),
  §3.13 (hand abilities, "cannot choose to discard") and Security Breach's "places a random card from their hand
  facedown here … Return each facedown card here to its owner's hand", which `tuckCards` may cover (to verify with the
  script). No `CampaignOp` change.
- **Status (card-data-pipeline, 2026-09-24):** cards 180-193 are emitted with `specificTo: campaign` (player cards)
  or as part of the `campaignSpecific: true` `mts_campaign` `EncounterSet` (encounter-side cards), per §1.13. The
  five flip pairs (§1.7) are emitted as `otherFaceId`-linked cards. `MTS_CAMPAIGN` (`data/mts/campaign.ts`, the
  `GMW_CAMPAIGN`/`TRORS_CAMPAIGN` hand-authored shape) names the five scenarios in box order and the
  `mts_campaign` set, but is deliberately not added to `data/index.ts`'s `CAMPAIGNS` aggregate — that list gates
  on a box being "ingested **and scripted**" (`data/index.ts`'s own comment on `CAMPAIGNS`), and `mts`'s campaign
  _instructions_ (the `CampaignDefinition` DSL — what each scenario's setup/victory does, System Shock's hand
  ability, each flip) are `ability-scripting-engineer`'s work, not emitted here. `MTS_CAMPAIGN` is importable
  directly in the meantime, and `packages/cards/src/campaigns/mts.gate.test.ts`'s synthetic-id run above still
  stands as the pre-check for that follow-up.

### 2.3 The Hood scenario

| Scenario | Main scheme deck                                                  | Encounter sets                           | 1A Setup                                                                                                                                                   | Needs (§3)                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| The Hood | Making Connections → Promised Prosperity → Crime State (3B loses) | The Hood, Standard; 7 set-aside modulars | "Choose 7 modular encounter sets and set them aside (you may choose randomly). Choose 1 of those sets at random, then shuffle it into the encounter deck." | §1.12, §3.18, Foul Play (§3.23) |

- `hood` has no `Scenario` record yet (`curation/hood.ts`: "scenario curation is a follow-up").
- "Each player must resolve The Hood's 'Foul Play' ability in player order": `resolveSpecials` with a scoped player
  (§3.23).

> **Status: scripted (2026-09-25).** Every `hood` ability ref resolves (`KNOWN_SKIPPED.hood` is empty and `PACK_STATUS`
> is `"scripted"` in `packages/cards/src/wave4/coverage.test.ts`): the villain, main scheme and The Hood's set, the nine
> modular sets, and Standard II / Expert II (§4 Q5), with §3.50–§3.60 built for the last gaps. **E2E:**
> `packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/e2e.test.ts` plays Spider-Man (standard, solo), Spider-Man and Captain Marvel
> (standard, two players) and Spider-Man in expert with Standard II and Expert II to a real outcome with the greedy
> driver, replays each log to a deep-equal state, runs the villain-phase audit clean, and checks every modular set the

## 3. Engine primitives for cycle 3 (owner: `game-rules-architect`)

**Build the mechanism, not the card.** Engine code never names a card; card names below say where each primitive is
needed, and each section names cards from other packs that compose with it.

**Priority order.** The box first (its scenarios, then its heroes, then its campaign), then the hero packs and The Hood
in release order. Within that, rules the whole box leans on come first. **A pack whose cards need an unbuilt primitive
stays data only.**

| §    | Primitive                                                                    | Needed by                                                                    | Status  |

| 3.1  | Additional forms (the form keyword)                                          | Spectrum, Vision; Shadowcat, Nick Fury                                       | landed  |
| 3.2  | Two main schemes in play, each paired with a villain; Focused Defense        | Tower Defense                                                                | landed  |
| 3.3  | Villains protected by each other's hit points: one defeat sweep              | Tower Defense; Four Horsemen (`aoa`)                                         | landed  |
| 3.4  | A main scheme stage's completion is replaceable                              | Tower Defense; Upgrading Adaptoids (`aos`)                                   | landed  |
| 3.5  | Damage on a card that is not a character (Avengers Tower)                    | Tower Defense                                                                | landed  |

### 3.1 Additional forms: the form keyword

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/additional-forms.test.ts` (8 tests: facedown forms
> grant none and have no title, but the owner finds them by printed form; a change turns the form faceup, is heard by
> "After you change form" and by the form card's own "this form" but not by an identity-only listener, and never uses the
> once-per-round change; one energy form at a time; no change, no trigger; `cannotChangeForm { formType }` stops only its
> type; a double-sided form card flips; the hero/alter-ego flip is an identity change; replay deep-equal). DSL:
> `packages/cards/src/dsl/wave4-primitives.test.ts` (5 tests). Corrupted Programming's "blank, except for keywords"
> landed later as §3.28. **Client:** log lines for `additionalFormChanged`, `cardTurnedFacedown` and `cardTurnedFaceup`,
> and a view of which form is up.

**Cards.** Spectrum: Monica Rambeau's Setup puts Gamma, Photon and Pulsar into play facedown; Energy Transformation
("After you change to this form, choose a facedown energy form upgrade → flip that card faceup to change to that
energy form"); Power Down ("After you change to this form, turn all your energy form upgrades facedown"); each form's
"After you change to this energy form"; Gamma Blast, Photon Speed, Pulsar Shield ("Change to Gamma energy form … If you
were already in Gamma energy form"); Speed of Light and Blue Marvel ("change energy forms"); Energy Duplication ("the
printed resource on your faceup energy form upgrade"); Loss of Control ("You cannot change energy forms"); Moxie and
Ready to Rumble ("After you change form"). Vision: "Change mass form by flipping your mass form upgrade over";
"While you are in Dense mass form"; "Play only if Vision is in Dense mass form"; Density Control ("After you change mass
form"); Corrupted Programming ("Treat your mass form upgrade's text box as if it were blank, except for keywords").

**Rules.** RRG 1.8 "Form, Change Form" (p. 21), quoted in §1.1: additional forms are separate from hero/alter-ego, do
not use the once-per-round flip, and changing one "does count as changing form for the purpose of triggering card
effects". A facedown card has no title, text or keywords (RRG 1.8 "Facedown"), so a facedown energy form grants no
form.

**What landed:**

- A player **is in "<name> <type> form"** while they control a faceup card whose showing face has `form { formType }`
  and is titled `<name>` (Gamma, Dense). **`Predicate inAdditionalForm { player, formType, name? }`** reads it; with no
  `name`, "in any <type> form". A facedown or blanked card grants none.
- **`EffectSpec changeAdditionalForm { player, formType, to?, toName? }`**: among the player's cards printing that form
  type, the one `to` names, else the one printed `toName`, else the only one if double-sided. A single-faced form card
  turns faceup and every other faceup one of that type turns facedown (§4 Q1); a double-sided one flips (also
  announcing `cardFlipped`). Already there: nothing changes and nothing triggers. Blocked by **`RuleSpec
  cannotChangeForm { formType }`** (new field; without it the rule still means only the hero/alter-ego flip, §4 Q8).
- **`formChanged` gains `change: "identity" | "additional"`** (always set) and, for an additional change, `formType`,
  `formName` and `formCardInstanceId`, which is the event's target. Log: `additionalFormChanged`.
- **`EffectSpec turnFacedown { target }`**: "Turn all your energy form upgrades facedown" and the Setup's "into play,
  facedown". Not a change of form, so it announces nothing (log `cardTurnedFacedown`).
- **`TargetQuery.printedForm`** (exclusion `wrongForm`) finds a form card by its printed keyword, facedown too, so
  "choose a facedown energy form upgrade" is a query.
- **DSL:** `changeAdditionalForm`, `turnFacedown` (`dsl/effects.ts`); `inAdditionalForm`, `printedForm`
  (`dsl/values.ts`); `on.youChangeIdentityForm()` ("After you change to this form" on Spectrum's or Vision's identity
  faces), `on.youChangeToThisForm()` (on the form card), `on.youChangeAdditionalForm(type)` (Density Control). Plain
  `on.youChangeForm()` still hears both (Moxie, Ready to Rumble); `on.playerChangesForm(to)` now means the identity flip
  only.
- **Scripting note:** Gamma Blast's "If you were already in Gamma energy form" is read before its own change, so test
  `inAdditionalForm("energy", "Gamma")` first and keep the answer.

**Composes with:** Shadowcat's Solid/Phased and Quick Shift, Permanently Phased (`mut_gen` 32031, 32040, 32055); Nick
Fury's Assault/Stealth suit forms (`aos` 50035a/b); every "after you change form" card (Moxie, `ant` 12016, `wsp`
13014, `hlk` 10009, `wonder_man` 58010).

### 3.2 Two main schemes in play, each paired with a villain; Focused Defense

**Cards.** Under Siege 1A/1B, The Armies of Thanos 2A/2B, Focused Defense, Proxima Midnight I–III, Corvus Glaive
I–III, every Tower Defense card that says "the main scheme" or "the villain".

**Rules.** MC21 pp. 10–11 and the p. 67 errata, quoted in `docs/phase7-wave4-sources.md` §3: both main schemes gain
threat in step 1 and feel acceleration and crisis; each villain schemes onto its own scheme; a minion schemes onto the
scheme with Focused Defense; encounter cards' "the main scheme" is both, a player card's is the controller's choice, a
player constant's is Focused Defense's scheme; the active villain is the one "who matches the attached scheme".

**What landed:**

- **`GameState.extraMainSchemes`** (absent otherwise, so saves are unchanged): stages in play beside the central one in
  the shared game area. `mainSchemeStates` and the new `sharedMainSchemes` list them, so completion (§3.4), crisis and
  `cardsInPlay` (with their attachments) reach them. **Step one** places each shared main scheme's own acceleration plus
  its own tokens plus the icons in play. A completed extra stage loses on its final stage and advances otherwise, like
  the central one.
- **`EffectSpec putMainSchemeStageIntoPlay { stageNumber, name? }`**: the main scheme card's first unspent stage of that
  number becomes an extra main scheme, in play before its A and B When Revealed resolve (so 2A's "attached to this stage"
  finds it), then its starting threat. The stage is spent.
- **`RuleSpec focusedMainScheme { scheme }`** (Focused Defense's constant, `scheme: host`): between frames the villain
  whose title the scheme's `villainOf` names takes the active counter (`activeVillainChanged { reason:
  "focusedScheme" }`), and the same scheme is the one minions scheme onto and player constants mean.
- **Scheme threat** (`pairedMainSchemeId`, read in `enemyScheme` after `schemeThreatDestination`): with extra main schemes
  in play, a villain places threat on the main scheme whose `villainOf` is its title, a minion on the Focused Defense
  scheme.
- **"The main scheme"** (`TargetRef mainScheme`) with extra main schemes and no separate game area: on an encounter card,
  every shared main scheme; on a player card, the one its controller chose for this ability, else the Focused Defense
  scheme. **The choice:** before a player card's effect that names the main scheme resolves, the effects frame inserts a
  `chooseTarget` among the main schemes (chooser: its controller, slot `MAIN_SCHEME_CHOICE`), once per ability. A
  constant never asks, so it reads the Focused Defense scheme.
- **`GameSetupConfig.sharedEncounterDeck`** (with `villains`): one deck `e1` built from `encounterDeck`, every villain's
  `encounterDeckId`. The scenario builder maps `MultipleVillains.encounterDecks: "shared"` to it (§5).
- **DSL:** `putMainSchemeStageIntoPlay`, `focusedMainScheme()`.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/two-main-schemes.test.ts` (5 tests: setup puts stage 2
> beside stage 1 with one shared deck, and Focused Defense makes Corvus active; after the player phase ends Focused
> Defense moves, both schemes gain step one's threat and the new active villain schemes onto her own scheme only, replay
> deep-equal; a minion schemes onto the Focused Defense scheme; a player card's "the main scheme" asks its controller
> which; an encounter card's is both and a player constant's is Focused Defense's). DSL:
> `packages/cards/src/dsl/wave4-primitives.test.ts`. **Known limits:** `nextMainSchemeStage` does not skip spent stages,
> so if Under Siege (stage 1) were ever completed without its replacement it would advance to the stage already beside
> it; both Tower Defense stages always replace their completion (§3.4), so no printed card reaches it. "The other
> villain" (Proxima's Power's boost) is the existing non-active villain ref (wave 2 §6.8), not re-tested here.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/villain-mutual-protection.test.ts` (4 tests: one at
> zero while the other has hit points stands; one effect bringing both to zero defeats both; the second reaching zero
> later takes the first down with it; with defeats on the stack because something listens, both still fall; replay
> deep-equal). **What landed:** `checkDefeats` decides every villain's defeat (dial at zero, `cannotBeDefeated`, not
> already pending) before applying any. When more than one falls in one sweep, each defeat goes on the stack marked
> `characterDefeated.protectionChecked`, and `applyDefeat` does not re-read `cannotBeDefeated` for it, so the first
> villain's fresh stage cannot shield the second. A single falling villain behaves exactly as before. Known limit: a
> "cannot be defeated" rule created by an interrupt to one of those defeats is not re-read for them; no printed card
> does that.

"Proxima Midnight cannot be defeated while Corvus Glaive has any hit points remaining", and the mirror on Corvus. The
sweep (`checkDefeats`) takes villains one at a time, and a defeated stage advances at once: with both at 0, Proxima
falls, Proxima II arrives with full hit points, and Corvus is now protected. RRG 1.8 "Damage" (p. 14) and ruling Jun 2,
2026 (2) make damage simultaneous. **Plan:** decide every villain's defeat in the sweep first, then apply them.
`cannotBeDefeated` with `while: valueAtLeast(remainingHpOf(named(...)), 1)` is the card script. **Composes with:** War,
Famine, Pestilence, Death (`aoa` 45081–45084, "cannot be defeated while another villain has at least 1 hit point").

### 3.4 A main scheme stage's completion is replaceable

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/main-scheme-completing.test.ts` (3 tests: "remove all
> the threat from this stage instead" keeps the final stage from completing and the rest of the ability resolves; an
> interrupt that replaces nothing leaves the completion to happen after it; with nothing listening the final stage
> loses as before; replay deep-equal). **What landed:** `TriggerEvent mainSchemeCompleting { schemeInstanceId,
> stageIndex }`, pushed by `checkOneMainScheme` only when an ability listens (a game without one completes exactly as
> before), with an interrupt window and the target scheme as its target. Its apply step (`applyMainSchemeCompleting`)
> completes the stage only if it still would: same stage, not completed, threat still at or above the target. The
> existing `cancelTriggeringEvent` (`instead`) is the replacement. **DSL:** `on.mainSchemeCompleting(what)`. A completion
> by card effect (`completeMainScheme`, Kang's stage 3) is not routed through it; no printed "would be completed"
> reacts to one.

"Forced Interrupt: When this stage would be completed, remove all the threat from this stage instead. Then, deal
6[per_hero] damage to Avengers Tower." `whenCompleted` resolves before an advance but cannot stop it. **Plan:** a
completion with a listener becomes a `mainSchemeCompleting` trigger event with an interrupt window; `instead` cancels
the completion (no advance, no loss). **Composes with:** Upgrading Adaptoids 1B (`aos` 50104b).

### 3.5 Damage on a card that is not a character

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/damage-on-environment.test.ts` (3 tests: damage dealt
> to an environment stays on it and never defeats it; at 9 per player the Stronghold side clears it and flips, and 9
> more on the Damaged side loses; the Stronghold side lets a unique card of its title enter play and the Damaged side
> does not; replay deep-equal). **What landed:** nothing was missing for the damage itself: `dealDamage` already deals
> to any card, the defeat sweep reads only characters, and "After damage is placed here" is a response to `dealDamage`
> with `selfIs: "target"`, `damageOn(self)` reads it, and "remove all of it" is `heal` of that much. **New:** `RuleSpec
> uniqueRuleExempt { title }` ("The unique rule does not apply to Avengers Tower"), read by `matchingCardInPlay`
> (which now takes `deps`) for a card entering play. **Open, §4 Q9:** the Damaged side's "When Revealed: Discard each
> other Avengers Tower from play" and a flip.

"Deal 3 damage to Avengers Tower"; "After damage is placed here, if there is at least 9[per_hero] damage here …";
"remove all of it". **Plan:** verify whether `dealDamage`/`placeDamage` accept an environment and announce a trigger;
add the event if not. Other raw cards that put damage "here" are checked when this lands.

### 3.6 A modular set's own deck: the Infinity Stone deck

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/set-deck-and-run-out.test.ts` (§3.6: 2 tests — the deck
> is built from the set's cards at setup and each card's discard home is the deck's own pile; the top card is put into
> play, its Special resolves and it goes to that pile). **What landed:** `GameSetupConfig.scenarioDecks[].buildAtSetup`
> (and `ScenarioDeckState.buildAtSetup`): scenario setup builds such a deck from the encounter deck right after shuffling
> it, before the setup-keyword cards enter play, with no card text asking. `ScenarioSeparateDeck.contents.trait` and
> `cardType: "environment"` are read by `buildScenarioDeck`. Everything else composed: "put the top card of the infinity
> stone deck into play" is `selectCards` of `scenarioDeck(name, top 1)` then `putIntoPlay`; "Place this card in the
> infinity stone deck discard pile" is `discard(self)` (its home); the empty-deck reshuffle is the existing `whenEmpty`.
> **For the scenario builder (§5):** every `EncounterSet.separateDecks` of a set in the game becomes a
> `GameSetupConfig.scenarioDecks` entry with `buildAtSetup: true`, and `singleVillainOnly` sets are refused with several
> villains. **Not yet proven:** "Apply its boost icons … as if it were a boost card" ("I Am Inevitable", Infinite
> Mischief) is expected to be `adjustBoostCount` by `boostIconsOn` of the discarded stone; the scripter confirms it.

Schema §1.10. **Plan:** build `EncounterSet.separateDecks` at setup (the scenario-deck machinery of wave 2 §3.3);
"put the top card of the infinity stone deck into play", "reveal the top card", "Place this card in the infinity stone
deck discard pile" (the deck's discard home), reshuffle when empty without penalty, and the "runs out" timing point
(§3.11). "Apply its boost icons … as if it were a boost card" is `adjustBoostCount` with `boostIconsOn` of the bound
card (to confirm).

### 3.7 Loki: random start, swap, a villain stage's Victory X, the victory count

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/villain-swap.test.ts` (5 tests: one Loki starts at random
> from the seed and the rest are set aside; a swap keeps the villain instance, its dial, status cards and counters, sets
> the old card aside and fires "after Loki is swapped", replay deep-equal; a swapped-in stalwart Loki sheds its status
> cards; a defeated Loki goes to the victory display and a random set-aside one takes over (dial reset, status and
> counters kept), and at the victory condition the players win, replay deep-equal; a villain whose last stage has
> Victory X goes to the victory display on an ordinary defeat). DSL: `wave4-primitives.test.ts`.
>
> **What landed:** `GameSetupConfig.randomStartingVillain` (the choice is the game's first RNG draw) and
> `GameSetupConfig.victoryCondition` (→ `ScenarioRules.victoryCondition`, read by **`ValueSpec victoryCondition`**; the
> scenario builder picks the number for the modes played). **`EffectSpec swapVillain { villain }`** and
> **`EffectSpec advanceToSetAsideVillain { villain }`** (`resolve/villain-swap.ts`): the villain stays one instance and
> takes a random set-aside villain card of its title; the set-aside instance takes the old card, so everything on the
> villain simply stays. A swap keeps the dial's value (its remaining hit points) and announces **`TriggerEvent
> villainSwapped`** (log `villainReplaced { reason: "swap" }`); an advance resets the dial, sends the old card to the
> victory display (Victory X) or out of the game, gives toughness its tough status card and resolves the new card's When
> Revealed (log `villainReplaced { reason: "advance" }`); used from a forced interrupt to the defeat, it leaves the
> dial above zero, so the defeat does not apply. **Victory X on a villain:** `defeatVillainStage` puts a defeated last
> stage with the keyword in the victory display (wave 3 §3.4's open item; also the Brotherhood of Mutants, `mut_gen`).
> A stalwart Loki's status cards go by the existing stalwart rule (wave 3 §3.7). **DSL:** `swapVillain`,
> `advanceToSetAsideVillain`, `victoryCondition`. **Not covered:** a non-final villain stage with Victory X (no printed
> card has one); Thunderbolt Backup's in-play swap (`aos` 50131b).

Schema §1.11. RRG 1.8 "'Swap'" (p. 42): swapping an in-play card with an out-of-play card that shares its title means
"neither card is considered to enter or leave play. Tokens, attached cards, tucked cards, and status cards on the
previously in-play card are transferred … If the swapped card has an associated hit point dial, that dial remains at
the same value." MC21 p. 24: "This does not cause Loki to leave play, enter play, or be revealed. … The Loki card that
was swapped out should be set-aside with the other remaining set-aside versions of Loki." Ruling Feb 28, 2026 (3):
permanent attachments move to the swapped-in villain. Loki's Cape: "After Loki is swapped with a set-aside Loki
villain". **Plan:** `EffectSpec swapVillain { villain, with: "randomSetAside" }` with a `villainSwapped` event; setup's
random starting villain; a defeated stage with Victory X goes to the victory display (wave 3 §3.4's open item);
"advance to a random set-aside Loki villain" on defeat; `ValueSpec victoryCondition`. **Composes with:** Stories and
Lies, Shatter the Illusion (`tt` God of Lies); Thunderbolt Backup's "swapping it with the minion already attached here"
(`aos` 50131b) is a different swap (both in play) and is not claimed.

### 3.8 An encounter ally attached to the main scheme (Odin)

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/captive-ally.test.ts` (2 tests: attached, Odin is in
> play but reached by no category and takes no attachment; detached, the first player controls him in play, and
> defeated he is removed from the game and the players lose, replay deep-equal). DSL: `wave4-primitives.test.ts`.
> **What landed:**
>
> - **An ally attached to a card and controlled by no player has no categories** (`categoriesOf`): ruling Jun 25, 2026
>   (4) #5, "Characters not under player control are not friendly characters". It is in play (`cardsInPlay`, by name).
> - **`EffectSpec detach { card, controller }`**: the attached card moves into the controller's play area under their
>   control, staying in play (logs `cardDetached`, `controllerChanged { reason: "effect" }`).
> - **`RuleSpec cannotHaveAttachments { target, from? }`**: no legal host for an attachment or upgrade from `from` (any,
>   `"encounter"` for the King side's "encounter cards", `"upgrade"` for Robert Kelly), read by
>   `attachmentHostCandidates` (so both encounter "attach to" and playing an upgrade) and by the `attach` effect.
> - **`RuleSpec leavingPlayLoses { target }`**: `leavePlay` ends the game as **`GameOutcome { result: "loss", reason:
>   "cardAbility" }`** (new) when a matching card leaves play.
> - "When Odin leaves play, remove him from the game" needs nothing: Odin is double-sided, and RRG 1.8 "Double-Sided
>   Card" (p. 17) already sends him out of the game (`leavePlay`), which also stops Med Lab (ruling Dec 17, 2025 (4) #2).
>   `leavePlay` now counts a card with `otherFaceId` as double-sided too, so the campaign's Cosmo is removed the same way.
> - The rest composes: "The first player gains control of Odin" is `controlledByFirstPlayer` with `while: not(isAttached
>   self)`; "does not count against ally limit" is `excludedFromAllyLimit`; flipping to his King side is `flipCard`.
>
> **Composes with:** Robert Kelly (`mut_gen` 32063, 32065a: detached, taken control of, "cannot have upgrades attached",
> "If Robert Kelly leaves play, the players lose"), Hope Summers (`next_evol` 40130). **Not built:** a general "when X
> leaves play" interrupt window (Abduct Superhumans `aos` 50081, Spider-Man `sm` 27017); no `mts` card needs one.

Odin's Torment 1A attaches Odin, captive side up, to the main scheme; Hall of Nastrond: "The first player detaches Odin
from the main scheme and takes control of him"; Odin: "While Odin is not attached to the main scheme, he gains: 'The
first player gains control of Odin. Odin cannot have cards attached and does not count against ally limit.' If Odin
leaves play, the players lose the game." Rulings Jun 25, 2026 (4) #5 (not friendly while attached) and Aug 3, 2026 (4)
#1 (takes no attachments while attached). **Plan:** an ally as an attachment of the main scheme (not a character, not
friendly), `EffectSpec detach { card, into: "play", controller }`, `RuleSpec cannotHaveAttachments { target, from? }`
("encounter cards" on the King side). `controlledByFirstPlayer` and `excludedFromAllyLimit` exist.

### 3.9 An ally treated as a minion

Fallen Warrior, Beguiled (`mts` 21153, 21178; `valk` 25031): "Treat attached ally as an [Undead] minion with a blank
text box. Attached minion's SCH is equal to its printed THW and it does not take consequential damage. … Attached ally
engages its controller." Ruling Dec 17, 2025 (1) #3: "the ally does not leave play and the 'minion' does not enter
play; the character remains in play and retains all tokens and attachments. (The process is essentially a status
change.)" **Plan:** a `RuleSpec treatAsMinion { target: host, traits, schFromThw, noConsequentialDamage, keepTraits? }`
read where a card's categories are decided (`categoriesOf`, beside `facedownAs`), cheap because it reads only the
card's own attachments. **Composes with:** 'Pool-ized (`deadpool` 44041), "Lost" Child (`jubilee` 47027), Manipulated
Mind (`sm` 27171, "except for traits"), Possessed (`storm` 36038), Malice (`next_evol` 40199).

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/treat-as-minion.test.ts` (3 tests: attached, the ally is
> an engaged minion nobody controls, with a blank text box, the new trait, SCH equal to its printed THW, its damage
> kept and no ally action offered, replay deep-equal; "(except for traits)" keeps the printed traits; when the
> attachment is discarded it is its controller's ally again with its text and damage). **What landed:** the plan's
> read-at-query-time rule would need the ability registry in `categoriesOf`/`isMinion`, which take none, so the
> ruling's "essentially a status change" is kept as state instead: **`CardInstance.treatedAs`** (optional; `kind`,
> `traits`, `keepPrintedTraits`, `schFromThw`, `source`, `controllerBefore`), set and cleared by `treat-as.ts
> syncTreatedAs`, which `relocateCard` calls whenever a card moves onto or off a host, from the host's attachments'
> **`RuleSpec treatHostAsMinion {traits, keepPrintedTraits?, schFromThw?}`**. It is set the moment the attachment
> lands, so the same ability's "Attached ally engages its controller" engages a minion. Readers: `categoriesOf`,
> `isMinion`, printed traits, blank abilities and keywords, `printedProfile` (a minion profile from the ally's printed
> ATK, THW-as-SCH and hit points). A new `select.ts isAlly` (the `ally` category) replaces the raw `type === "ally"`
> play-area walks (legal attackers/thwarters, defenders, Melter's forced ally defense, the ally limit, Team-Up's
> friendly characters, why-not). Leaving play clears it. Event `treatedAsChanged`. **DSL:**
> `constant(treatAttachedAllyAsMinion(traits, { keepPrintedTraits? }))`. **Not covered here:** Mind Control, Redemption and Karma landed as §3.29; Reluctant Foe
> (`aos` 50171, a hero treated as a minion with a replaced text box).

### 3.10 Flipping a card into a separately emitted face of another type

Schema §1.7. **Plan:** `flipCard` on a card with `otherFaceId` replaces the instance's card; RRG 1.8 "Flip" (p. 20)
discards attachments, tucked cards, status cards and tokens when the type changes, and keeps them when it does not
(the side-scheme-to-side-scheme flips). A side scheme that flips on "When Defeated" is still defeated (Victory X, "is in
the victory display" readers), then becomes its other face in play.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/other-face.test.ts` (3 tests: a side scheme that flips
> on its When Defeated into an ally stays in play under the first player's control with its counters discarded, replay
> deep-equal; into a minion, engaged with the first player; into another side scheme, keeping its counters and entering
> with starting threat plus hinder). **What landed:** `flipCard` on a card with `otherFaceId` calls
> `resolve/other-face.ts flipToOtherFace`: the instance takes the other card's id; a different type discards
> attachments and tucked cards and clears status cards, damage, threat and counters (RRG 1.8 "Flip", p. 20) and moves
> the card where its new type lives (minion engaged with "you", ally/support/upgrade under "you", attachment on its
> first legal host, scheme or environment in the villain's area; "you" is the first player for a side scheme's When
> Defeated). The new face is then treated as entering play (§4 Q17, user decision: it enters play). A defeated side scheme's leave-play step is now
> guarded by `refMatches self {printedId}`, so one that flipped during its own When Defeated stays in play; its
> `schemeDefeated` event still fires (the campaign's "if Secure the Landing Pad was defeated"). Event
> `cardFlippedToOtherFace`. **DSL:** none new (`flipCard(self)` in a `whenDefeated`). **Not covered:** a side scheme with
> Victory X that flips (none printed).

### 3.11 Timing points when a deck runs out

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/set-deck-and-run-out.test.ts` (§3.11: 2 tests — taking
> a scenario deck's last card announces it once, then the deck takes its discard pile back with no penalty, replay
> deep-equal; a player's deck that runs out and resets is announced to that player's cards). **What landed:**
> `TriggerEvent deckRanOut { deck: "player" | "scenario", playerId?, name? }`, response window only, pushed between
> frames and only when an ability listens. A player's deck: recorded as it resets (`resetPlayerDeck`). A scenario deck:
> recorded by the move that took its last card (`settlePlayerDecks`), so a deck that starts empty before setup builds it
> never counts. The record is `GameState.pendingDeckRunOuts` (absent until first used), drained by the flow
> (`announceDeckRunOuts`). **DSL:** `on.yourDeckRunsOut()`, `on.aPlayerResetsTheirDeck()`, `on.scenarioDeckRunsOut(name)`.
> A player deck that empties with an empty discard pile does not reset (RRG 1.8 p. 33) and is not announced until it does.

Soul World ("After your deck runs out of cards"), Universal Church of Truth ("After a player resets their deck"), Thanos
I–III ("After the infinity stone deck runs out"). The engine logs `playerDeckReset` (wave 3 §4 Q15) but announces no
trigger event. **Plan:** `TriggerEvent deckRanOut { deck: player | scenarioDeck name, playerId? }`, heard-only.

### 3.12 Counting different aspects; Adam Warlock's copy limit

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/distinct-aspects.test.ts` (1 test: each of the four
> aspects counted once, a printed aspect included, basic and 'Pool not) and `packages/engine/src/max-copies-per-title.test.ts`
> (the copy limit, §1.4). **What landed:** `ValueSpec distinctAspects { cards }`; DSL `distinctAspectsOf`. **Composes:**
> "discard up to 4 cards from the top of your deck → …" (Karmic Blast, Cosmic Awareness, Magic Attack, Zone of Silence)
> is scripted as effects — a `chooseOne` of 1–4, each `selectCards(topOfDeck(n))` then `moveCards` to the discard pile —
> with the bound cards read by `distinctAspectsOf` or `countAmong`; the composition is in `wave4-primitives.test.ts`. The
> printed arrow makes the discard a cost of the extra damage; as an effect the one difference is that it resolves after
> the first 4 damage is chosen, which no card reads (flagged, not open). Battle Mage's "If that card is: Aggression – …"
> is `refMatches(chosen, { aspect }, { anywhere: true })` per option.

Karmic Blast, Cosmic Awareness, Regeneration Cycle: "for each different aspect discarded this way". `ValueSpec
distinctCardTypes` exists (Time Stone's "different card type"); **plan:** `ValueSpec distinctAspects { cards }`
(the four core aspects, `printedAspect` included). Battle Mage's "If that card is: Aggression – …" composes from
`refMatches` with `aspect`. Deckbuilding is §1.4 plus `validateDeck`.

### 3.13 Abilities active in hand; "cannot choose to discard this card"

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/hand-abilities.test.ts` (3 tests: an action that works in
> hand is offered and used from hand and not once the card is in play, replay deep-equal; a response that works in hand
> is offered from hand and puts the card into play; a chosen discard never offers a card that cannot be chosen). **What
> landed:** **`AbilityDefinition.activeIn: "hand"`**: `useAbility` and `legalActions` accept such an action only while
> the card is in its user's hand (and every other action only in play); `inHandCandidates` offers such a triggered
> ability to the hand's owner (its "you"), as an ability, not a play of the card; `candidatesFor` never offers it in
> play. **`RuleSpec cannotChooseToDiscard`** on a hand-active constant keeps the card out of an effect's chosen discard,
> a discard-from-hand cost, the end-of-phase discard and the mulligan (`handOptions`); a random discard still takes it.
> **DSL:** `inHand(definition)`, `cannotChooseToDiscard`. **Behavior change to know:** a non-event card's action
> ability could previously be used from hand through a hand-crafted `useAbility` command (no legal move offered it);
> that is now refused.

Pip the Troll: "While Pip the Troll is in your hand, he gains 'Interrupt: When a player is attacked, spend [energy][mental]
resources → put Pip the Troll into play under that player's control.'" System Shock (campaign): "You cannot choose to
discard this card from your hand. While this card is in your hand, it gains: 'Alter-Ego Action: …'". **Plan:** an
`AbilityDefinition.activeIn: "hand"` read by trigger candidates and actions; `RuleSpec cannotChooseToDiscard { cards }`
for discard choices from hand.

### 3.14 Player events shuffled into the encounter deck (Cosmic Entities)

In-Betweener, Living Tribunal, Eternity, The Gardener: "Action: Shuffle this card into the encounter deck (without
looking). When Revealed: … and remove this card from the game. This effect cannot be canceled." FAQ (RRG 1.8 p. 62):
resolved as a boost card, it goes to the encounter discard pile. Ruling Jan 17, 2026 (5): with several encounter decks,
the active villain's. **Plan:** a player card in the encounter deck keeps its owner; its When Revealed resolves when a
player reveals it; `uncancellable` on the ability; a discarded one goes to the encounter discard pile.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/cosmic-entity.test.ts` (3 tests: played, the event
> joins the active villain's encounter deck owned by its player, controlled by nobody, and discards to the encounter
> discard pile; revealed, its When Revealed resolves and removes it from the game even with a forced "cancel its effects
> and discard it" in play, replay deep-equal; "you" on it is the player who revealed it). **What landed:**
> `moveCards … "encounterDeckShuffle"` now takes a player card: it keeps `ownerId`, loses its controller and is homed to
> the active villain's encounter deck (`CardHome encounterDeck`), so `discardZoneFor` sends it (as a boost card or a
> canceled reveal) to that encounter discard pile, and `gameAbilityFrames` makes the revealing player its "you". A
> revealed event still where it was dealt when its reveal finishes is discarded like a treachery.
> **`AbilityDefinition.uncancellable`** on a When Revealed, and **`RuleSpec cannotBeCanceled {cards, while?}`** (read
> from the revealed card itself wherever it is, and from play), make `cancelRevealedCard` / `cancelWhenRevealed` change
> nothing (`rules.ts revealCannotBeCanceled`). **Composes with:** Longshot and Cornered! (`mojo` 39071, 39017, "This
> effect cannot be canceled"), Frequent Flyers and its siblings (`sm` 27108–27110, 27112, "In expert mode, … cannot be
> canceled"), Dark Scepter (`tt` 55036, "Treacheries cannot be canceled"). **DSL:** `uncancellable(whenRevealed(…))`,
> `cannotBeCanceled(query, when?)`. See §4 Q16 (decided: a cancel that can do nothing is not offered; §3.27).

### 3.15 "After the last X counter is removed from here"

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/spell-environments.test.ts` (§3.15: fires on the last
> counter only, the Spell is discarded and "your identity" is its play area's player; replay deep-equal). **What
> landed:** `TriggerEvent countersRemoved { instanceId, counterType, amount, remaining }` with interrupt and response
> windows, pushed by `EffectSpec removeCounters` only when an ability listens (otherwise the removal happens at once, as
> before); its apply step removes them, so the uses keyword's discard still follows. **`EventPattern.eventAtMost`**, the
> mirror of `eventAtLeast`: `{ remaining: 0 }` is "the last". **DSL:** `on.lastCounterRemoved(counterType)`. **Not
> covered:** counters removed as a cost (`spendCounters`) do not push the event; no printed "last counter" card removes
> its counters as a cost.

Fireball, Manipulation, Pacification, Rubblestorm; Holding Cell (`aos` 50105a–50108a), Phoenix Force (`phoenix`
34002a). **Plan:** verify `removeCounters` announces an event; add `countersRemoved { instanceId, counterType,
remaining }` if not.

### 3.16 Encounter cards in a player's play area

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/spell-environments.test.ts` (§3.16: a revealed Spell
> environment goes in front of the revealing player, controlled by no one, and is found by `inPlayAreaOf`; any other
> environment still goes to the villain's area). **What landed:** **`RuleSpec entersRevealersPlayArea { cards }`** (a
> scenario rule the scripter puts on Ebony Maw's own cards), read by `enterPlayOnReveal`, the path both a reveal and
> `putIntoPlay` take; **`TargetQuery.inPlayAreaOf`** (exclusion `notInPlayArea`); `uncontrolledYouOf` now names the
> play area's player for an environment there too, and a triggered ability on such a card (or an obligation, or an
> attachment on a player card) resolves with that player as "you". **DSL:** `inPlayAreaOf(player)`. **Client:** Spell
> environments in a player's area; one line in `view/highlights.ts` (added).

MC21 p. 6: a revealed Spell environment goes in front of the revealing player; Ebony Maw's interrupt reads "each Spell
card in your play area". **Plan:** verify where `putIntoPlay` places an environment for a player, and add a
`TargetQuery.inPlayAreaOf: PlayerRef` if no query reads it.

### 3.17 Alliance: paying a card's costs as a group

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/alliance.test.ts` (10 tests: a resource cost paid
> from two players' hands, each card to its owner's discard pile, only the playing player resolving the card; another
> player's hand card refused without alliance; another player's resource ability used, its controller paying its cost
> and logged as the generator, refused without alliance; "exhaust an [Avenger] character and a [Guardian] character"
> taking another player's character, refused without alliance; one character with both traits cannot pay both slots;
> `legalActions` offers the card when only the table can pay it, and not its non-alliance twin; "After you spend this

### 3.18 Set-aside modular sets; mode-only faces; Standard II

Schema §1.8, §1.9, §1.12. **Plan:** setup sets aside the chosen modular sets; `EffectSpec shuffleRandomSetAsideSet`
("Choose 1 set-aside modular encounter set at random, then shuffle it into the encounter deck"); a `modeOnly` card is
put into play on its expert face in expert mode. **Composes with:** Wheel of Genres (`mojo` 39026a/b, "if there are no

### 3.19 Readying as a costed act; "cannot be readied by player card effects"

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/ready-cost.test.ts` (5 tests: at the end of the

Mister Fear: "As an additional cost for the engaged player to ready a hero or ally they control, the player must spend
a [mental] resource." Undermine Support (`aos` 50174), the same for a support. Unnatural Storm: "Heroes and allies
cannot be readied by player card effects." **Plan:** a `RuleSpec readyCost` and `cannotReady.bySource`.

### 3.20 A trigger on damage a card prevented

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/damage-prevented-trigger.test.ts` (4 tests: an attack

Abjuration: "Prevent all damage to Ebony Maw. Forced Response: After Abjuration prevents 2 or more damage from a single
attack, discard it." **Plan:** check what `damagePrevented` carries; a trigger event naming the preventing card and
the amount.

### 3.21 An enemy attack against a chosen character

Speed Demon: "When a character attacks Speed Demon, Speed Demon attacks that character. (Resolve Speed Demon's attack
first.)"; Crossfire: "When Crossfire attacks, he attacks the friendly character with the fewest remaining hit points."
**Plan:** check wave 1 §3.6's redirection first.

Death Perception ("Play the set-aside Death-Glow upgrade as if it were in your hand"), "the enemy with Death-Glow

### 3.24 A character that ignores guard, patrol and the crisis icon

Evasive Maneuvering (`nebu` 22005): "While in hero form, Nebula ignores the guard keyword, the patrol keyword, and the
crisis icon." Survey (every raw pack, "ignore(s) … guard/patrol/crisis"): the same standing exemption on Wasp
(`ironheart` 29034), Shadowcat's ally and Phased form (`mut_gen` 32002, 32030a) and Psionic Training (`psylocke` 41010,
guard and patrol). Every other hit is one effect's own (Cable Arrow, Natural Flight, Photon Speed, Retinal Display,
Grapnel Launcher, Just Passing Through, …) and is the existing `ignoreCrisis` on `thwart` / `removeThreat`.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/character-ignores.test.ts` (4 tests: guard no longer
> stops the exempt hero attacking the villain; its basic thwart and "(thwart)" ability remove threat from the main
> scheme past patrol and a crisis icon; a removal that is neither its thwart nor its own is still stopped by the

> in play). **What landed:** **`RuleSpec characterIgnores {target, ignores: ("guard" | "patrol" | "crisis")[],

> **Composes with:** Wasp, Shadowcat, Psionic Training as printed. The response cards that fire after a character

> See §4 Q19 for the reading of "ignores the crisis icon" on removal that is not a thwart.

### 3.25 Discarding cards you control as a cost

Lethal Weapon (`nebu` 22030): "Hero Action: Discard an upgrade you control → discard this attachment." Survey (every raw
pack, "discard a/an <X> you control →"): Noble Sacrifice and "You Got This!" (`magneto` 49018, 49019, an ally), Repurpose
(`spdr` 31016, a [Tech] upgrade), Delusion of Collusion (`sm` 27170, an ally or [persona] support), Tinkering (`gmw`
16029b, already scripted as a chosen discard in its effects, which lets it be used with nothing to discard; it can move
to this cost), The Ends Justify the Means (`aos` 50177, a chooseOne branch whose cost this is). Haywire and Air Static
(`ironheart` 29038, 29039) put the discard inside a "choose to either … or take 2 indirect damage" cost, which this
does not cover.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/discard-cost.test.ts` (3 tests: the only matching card
> is discarded to pay, then the effect resolves, replay deep-equal; with no matching card the cost cannot be paid, so
> the card is neither offered nor playable; with a choice, the player names the card and the other stays) and in a real
> game in `packages/cards/src/wave4/nebu/nebula-obligation-nemesis.test.ts` (Lethal Weapon on the Gamora ally,
> discarding Evasive Maneuvering). **What landed:** **`AbilityCost.discardCards: InPlayCostPick`**, a third
> `InPlayCostMode` ("discard") beside exhaust and return: the same candidates (cards in play the payer controls that
> match, or any player's for an alliance card), payable only by a card that can leave play, paid by discarding each
> pick; the window's cost-card prompt (`chooseCostCards.mode`) carries it. **DSL:** `discardCardsCost(query, opts)`,
> binding `"discarded"`. **Scripted:** `22030.lethal-weapon-action`, off `KNOWN_SKIPPED`.

### 3.26 A friendly character attacks its own player

Old Rivals (`nebu` 22031, errata RRG 1.8 p. 67): "When Revealed: Gamora attacks you. If the Gamora hero or ally is in
play, she attacks you (resolve her ATK against you without exhausting her). If no attack was made this way, this card
gains surge." Ruling Jun 25, 2026 (4) #1: the first sentence is the Gamora minion, the second the hero or ally. FAQ (RRG
1.8 p. 62): she "is considered to have attacked", and an ally takes consequential damage. Survey (every raw pack, "X
attacks you" naming a hero or ally): no other card makes a friendly character attack its own player; every other "X
attacks you" is an enemy (`enemyAttack`).

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/friendly-attack.test.ts` (3 tests: the ally's ATK is
> dealt to you as her attack, she is not exhausted, takes her consequential damage, no surge, replay deep-equal; with no
> Gamora in play no attack is made and the card surges; a stunned Gamora discards the stun instead and the card surges)
> and in a real game in `packages/cards/src/wave4/nebu/nebula-obligation-nemesis.test.ts` (Nebula against Rhino, the
> Gamora ally in play, Old Rivals revealed in the villain phase; and alone, where it surges). **What landed:**
> **`EffectSpec friendlyCharacterAttacks {attacker, player, bind?}`**: the first friendly character the ref names (a
> hero-form identity or an ally a player controls) makes her controller's `attack` against `player`'s identity, with
> no boost, no defense step and no exhausting, followed by an ally's consequential damage (`pushConsequentialDamage`,
> now exported); a stunned attacker or a "—" ATK makes no attack, reported as `<bind>.made` 0. **DSL:**
> `friendlyCharacterAttacks(attacker, player?, { bind })`. **Scripted:** `22031.when-revealed` (the minion's
> `enemyAttack`, then this, then surge if neither was made); Nebula's `KNOWN_SKIPPED` is now empty.

### 3.27 A cancel with nothing it can cancel is not offered

§4 Q16, as the user decided it on 2026-09-24: a cancel aimed at a card that cannot be canceled (the Cosmic Entities,
§3.14; Longshot, Cornered!, the `sm` expert treacheries, anything under Dark Scepter) is hidden from the legal actions,
so it is never offered and no cost is paid.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/cancel-no-target.test.ts` (2 tests: against an
> ordinary treachery the optional cancel is offered and its exhaust cost paid; against a card that cannot be canceled
> it is never offered, nothing is exhausted, and the card's When Revealed resolves). **What landed:** the trigger
> candidate scan (`resolve/triggers.ts cancelHasNoTarget`) drops any ability whose top-level effects cancel the card
> being revealed (`cancelWhenRevealed`, `cancelRevealedCard`) when `revealCannotBeCanceled` holds for it: in play, used
> from hand (`activeIn: "hand"`), and events played from hand in the window, forced or optional. The reading is RRG 1.8
> "Initiating Abilities" (p. 24, step 2): the revealed card is the cancel's target, and with no valid target the
> ability cannot be initiated, so the whole ability (Order and Chaos's damage and Black Widow's extra reveal included)
> is not offered. The §3.14 check in the cancel effect itself stays as the backstop.

### 3.28 A blank text box except for keywords

Corrupted Programming (`vision` 26028): "Treat your mass form upgrade's text box as if it were blank, except for
keywords." RRG 1.8 "Blank" (p. 10) blanks keywords with the text box, so the exception has to be carried. Survey (every
raw pack, "blank … except"): every other card says "except for [Traits]", which the engine already keeps (a blanked
card's traits are untouched). This was §3.1's open item.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/blank-except-keywords.test.ts` (2 tests: blanked
> "except for keywords", a mass form upgrade loses its abilities but keeps its form and other keywords; a plain blank
> takes the keywords too, and with no blank everything is live). **What landed:** **`RuleSpec blankTextBox.exceptKeywords`**:
> `blankedByConstantRules` now keeps two sets, every blanked card and those whose keywords go too; `keywordsBlankFor`
> (`select.ts`) is what `printedKeywordsOf` (and so `activeFormType`, `hasKeyword`) reads. **DSL:**
> `blanksTextBox(query, { exceptKeywords: true })`. The `vision` scripter targets "your mass form upgrade" with
> `query("upgrade", { controller: "you", printedForm: "mass" })`.

### 3.29 A minion treated as an ally (the mirror of §3.9)

The mirror of §3.9. Survey (every raw pack, "treat … as a [X] ally"): Mind Control (`phoenix` 34009) and Redemption
(`bp` 51036), upgrades on a minion; Karma (`rogue` 38011), an effect lasting "while Karma is in play". Each: "take
control of [the] minion and treat it as a [Controlled/Redeemed] ally with a blank text box. Its THW is equal to its
printed SCH and it takes 1 (Karma: 2) consequential damage after it thwarts or attacks."

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/treat-as-ally.test.ts` (4 tests: under a Mind Control
> upgrade the minion is the player's ally, in their play area, not engaged, [Controlled] only, text box blank, THW =
> printed SCH, still attached, replay deep-equal; it thwarts with that THW and takes 1 consequential damage; with the
> upgrade discarded it is a minion again, engaged with the player who controlled it; a Karma-like effect's minion is an
> ally while the card is in play and a minion again once it leaves). **What landed:** `TreatedAs` is now a union;
> kind **`ally`** (`traits`, `thwFromSch`, `consequential`, `source`, `controller`, `engagedBefore`) comes from
> **`RuleSpec treatHostAsAlly {traits, thwFromSch?, consequential}`** on an attachment (the attachment's controller
> takes control; `syncTreatedAs` as for §3.9) or from **`EffectSpec treatAsAlly {target, traits, thwFromSch?,
> consequential}`** (source = the effect's card; `leavePlay` calls `releaseTreatedBy`). Readers: `categoriesOf`
> (`ally`, `character`), `isMinion` false, traits, blank abilities and keywords, `printedProfile` (an ally profile from
> printed ATK, SCH-as-THW and hit points), `pushConsequentialDamage` (its own amount; an ally treated as a minion takes
> none). The `isAlly` play-area readers from §3.9 pick it up as an attacker, thwarter and defender, and it counts
> toward the ally limit (none of the three cards says otherwise). **DSL:** `constant(treatAttachedMinionAsAlly(traits,
> n))`, `treatAsAlly(target, traits, n)`. **Not covered:** Reluctant Foe (`aos` 50171: a hero from the collection
> treated as an [Elite] minion with a replaced text box).

### 3.30 A resource ability's own effects

Gauntlet Gun (`warm` 23005): "Resource: Exhaust Gauntlet Gun → generate a [wild] resource for a War Machine event and
place 1 ammo counter on War Machine." Survey (every raw pack, "Resource: … generate … resource … and/then …" and
"Resource: … . <effect>"): War Cry, Improvisation, Bodyguard, Fortitude (`mut_gen` 32180, 32185, 32190, 32195: "Gain a
tough status card" / "Ready an ally and heal 2 damage from it" / "Draw 1 card" / "Stun an enemy", then "Remove this card
from the game and the campaign pool"); Psi-Knife / Psi-Katana (`psylocke` 41002a/b, "You may flip this card");
Cybernetic Arm (`winter` 54002, "That event deals 1 additional damage") and Ruby Quartz Visor (`cyclops` 33003, "That
attack gains piercing and ranged"), which modify the card paid for.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/resource-effects.test.ts` (2 tests: used to pay, the
> resource ability's effect resolves with the payment and before the card paid for, replay deep-equal; not used,
> nothing happens) and in a real game in `packages/cards/src/wave4/warm/war-machine-kit.test.ts` (Repulsor Beam paid
> with the Gun's resource gets the ammo counter; paid from hand, the Gun stays ready and no counter lands).
> **What landed:** `payPayment` now returns a **`SpentPayment`** (`cards` discarded, and `resourceAbilities` used
> that carry effects); **`announceResourcesSpent`** takes it and, after the "after you spend" events, pushes each used
> resource ability's `effects` (so they resolve first: part of paying, RRG 1.8 "Initiating Abilities", p. 24, steps
> 5–6), with "you" the player who used it, "self" its card, and slot **`paidFor`** the card or ability paid for (for
> "that event deals 1 additional damage"). A resource ability used for nothing (never put in a payment) does nothing.
> Log event `resourceAbilityEffects`. **DSL:** `resource(generates, options, ...effects)` / `heroResource(...)`.
> **Scripted:** `23005.gauntlet-gun-resource` now places the counter. **Composes with:** the `mut_gen` campaign
> upgrades (effects plus `moveCards(self, "removedFromGame")` and the campaign-pool removal), Psi-Knife (an optional
> `flipCard(self)`), Cybernetic Arm and Ruby Quartz Visor (a modifier on `chosen("paidFor")`; the "that attack"
> modifier itself is the scripter's to pick from the existing attack modifiers).

### 3.31 A character that cannot defend

Intangible (`vision` 26002): "Vision cannot attack or defend." Survey (every raw pack, "cannot defend"): Grant Ward
(`aos` 50022, "Grant Ward cannot defend."), Tracking Display (`sm` 27152, "Each character cannot defend against
attached villain's attacks."). Taunt (`angel` 42016, `cw` 56048, "Other characters cannot defend against this attack")
is scoped to one attack and is not covered here.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/cannot-defend.test.ts` (2 tests: a character that
> cannot defend is never offered, the others are; scoped to the villain's attacks, nobody may defend the villain but a
> minion's attack is defended as usual) and in a real game in `packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-kit.test.ts`
> (Intangible Vision can neither attack the villain nor defend; Dense Vision can do both). **What landed:**
> **`RuleSpec cannotDefend {target, attacker?, while?}`** (`rules.ts cannotDefend`), read by `legalDefenders` (now
> given the registry and the attacking enemy, and exported from `@mc/engine`), by the defender prompt's why-not
> (exclusion `cannotDefend`, with a client label) and by a "(defense)" ability, which does not make such a character
> the defender. **Scripted:** `26002.intangible-constant` (`cannotAttack` on the attacking host plus this), off
> `KNOWN_SKIPPED`.

### 3.32 One thwart that ignores patrol

Just Passing Through (`vision` 26010): "Hero Action (thwart): Remove 3 threat from a scheme, ignoring the patrol keyword
and the crisis icon." The one-shot sibling of §3.24. Survey (every raw pack, "ignor… patrol"): Natural Flight (`angel`
42006, "If you are Angel, this thwart ignores the crisis icon and the patrol keyword"), Grapnel Launcher (`jj` 61023, "For
this thwart … ignores the patrol keyword and any crisis icons", a basic thwart made by effect), Retinal Display's back
(`sm` 27186b, "your hero's basic thwarts ignore the crisis icon and the patrol keyword", standing: `characterIgnores`
scoped to basic thwarts is not built).

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/character-ignores.test.ts` (1 new test: the thwart
> removes threat from the main scheme past patrol, with and without a crisis icon, and the next ordinary thwart is
> stopped, by patrol or crisis) and in a real game in `packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-kit.test.ts` (Intangible
> Vision against Rhino with Crowd Control's crisis icon in play). **What landed:** **`EffectSpec thwart.ignorePatrol`**,
> carried on the `thwart` event and read by `threatRemovalBlocked` for the removal that thwart makes. **DSL:**
> `thwart(n, target, { ignorePatrol: true })`. **Scripted:** `26010.just-passing-through-action`, off `KNOWN_SKIPPED`.

### 3.33 A card with a given timing word in its text

Phase Disruption (`vision` 26011): "Confuse an enemy. Choose an attachment on that enemy with the text 'Hero Action' or
'Hero Response' and discard that attachment." Survey (every raw pack, "with the text" / "with a '…' ability"): Phase
Strike (`mut_gen` 32038), Sunfire (`wolv` 35014), Electromagnetic Blast (`magneto` 49008), Disarming Defense
(`wonder_man` 58033), all "Hero Action" or "Hero Response"; Target Lock and Phased Out (`cw` 56130, `synthezoid` 57076),
"Hero Response" or "Hero Interrupt"; Warpath (`angel` 42013), "an event with a 'Hero Action' ability".

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/ability-timing-query.test.ts` (3 tests: matches the
> attachments carrying the named timing words and not a Forced Response; a blanked text box has none; each trigger
> shape maps to its printed timing word) and in a real game in `packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-kit.test.ts`
> (Rhino with Lethal Weapon attached: Phase Disruption confuses him and discards it). **What landed:** **`TargetQuery
> abilityTiming: AbilityTimingWord[]`** ("heroAction", "heroResponse", "forcedInterrupt", …) matched against the card's
> live abilities through `select.ts timingWordOf` (trigger kind + form label + forced), exclusion `noSuchAbility`
> with a client label. The printed word is read from the script's trigger shape, which the ability DSL already makes
> match the printed label (`heroAction`, `heroResponse`, …). **Scripted:** `26011.phase-disruption-action`, off
> `KNOWN_SKIPPED`.

### 3.34 The attacking enemy from any trigger

Flow Like Water (`vision` 26016): "Response: After you play a [Defense] card, deal 1 damage to the attacking enemy." The
trigger is the play, not the attack, so `eventSource` names the played card. Survey (every raw pack, "the attacking
enemy"): Riposte, Tally Ho! (`ncrawler` 48018, 48011), Spider-UK (`sm` 27012), Daredevil (`spdr` 31014), Never Back Down
(`qsv` 14014), Disarming Defense (`wonder_man` 58033); most sit on an attack-scoped trigger and already read
`eventSource`, but any of them can use this ref.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/attacking-enemy.test.ts` (2 tests: nothing outside an
> attack; the innermost attack's enemy during one) and in a real game in
> `packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-pack-cards.test.ts` (Dense Vision with Flow Like Water plays Mass Increase
> against Rhino's attack; Rhino takes 1 damage). **What landed:** **`TargetRef attackingEnemy`**, the sibling of
> `defendingCharacter`: the enemy of the innermost `enemyAttack` on the stack, if in play. **DSL:** `attackingEnemy`.
> **Scripted:** `26016.flow-like-water-response`, off `KNOWN_SKIPPED`.

### 3.35 Discard a boost card instead of applying it

Defiance (`vision` 26018): "Hero Interrupt (defense): When a boost card on an enemy attacking you would be turned faceup,
discard it instead." `cancelBoostIcons` / `cancelBoostAbility` cancel parts of a boost card that is still applied; this
removes the card from the activation altogether. Survey: Close Call (`gmw` 16158, "cancel that card's 'Boost' ability and all of its boost icons, then discard it") is the same outcome.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/boost.test.ts` (1 new test: the boost card's ability
> does not resolve, its icons are not added, and it goes to the encounter discard pile) and in a real game in
> `packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-pack-cards.test.ts` (Defiance against Rhino's attack). **What landed:**
> **`EffectSpec discardBoostCard {bind?}`**: in the resolving boost card's turned-faceup window, it cancels the card's
> ability and icons and moves it to its discard pile at once, so the count step finds nothing to apply; game event
> `boostCancelled` gains scope `"discarded"` (client log line and villain-phase breakdown label added). The engine turns
> the card faceup and then opens that window, so "would be turned faceup" is answered there. A response "after a
> boost card is turned faceup" still sees the event; no printed card combines the two. **DSL:** `discardBoostCard()`.
> **Scripted:** `26018.defiance-interrupt`, off `KNOWN_SKIPPED`.
>
> **Revised (2026-10-22, issue #348):** answering in the faceup window let a player see the card before choosing
> Defiance. FFG's ruling (Alex Werner, RRG 1.0-1.4 rulings, "is" vs "would be" for interrupts) says Defiance discards
> the card without turning it faceup. The engine now opens a facedown `boostCardTurningFaceup` interrupt window before
> each enemy activation's boost card is flipped, when an ability could answer it; Defiance triggers there, and a card it
> discards is never turned up. "When a boost card is turned faceup" (Preemptive Strike) keeps the faceup window.

### 3.36 An event pattern that accepts several values

Machine Man (`vision` 26022): "Interrupt: When Machine Man attacks or thwarts, spend up to 3 resources of any type →
Machine Man gets +1 THW and +1 ATK for this use for each resource spent this way." "For this use" needs the
`basicPowerUsing` interrupt (before the power's value is read), which also carries his defense. Survey (every raw pack,
"attacks or thwarts"): Elixir, Power Gloves, Gamora (`drax`), Adam Warlock, Falcon, Agent 13, Spider-Man (`silk`, `sm`),
Spider-Ham, Absorbing Man (`tt`), Cosmo; all but Machine Man and Absorbing Man are responses to the attack/thwart
events and already use `on.attacksOrThwarts`.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/event-is-list.test.ts` (1 test: `{ power: ["attack",
> "thwart"] }` matches an attack or a thwart and not a defense) and in a real game in
> `packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-pack-cards.test.ts` (Machine Man thwarts, the player spends two cards, and
> he removes his THW plus the resources spent, to a maximum of 3). **What landed:** **`EventPattern.eventIs` values
> may be lists** (any one matches). DSL `on.basicPowerUsing(who, { power: [...] })`. **Engine fix found on the way:**
> an in-play triggered ability whose only resource cost is an X ("spend up to 3") skipped the payment prompt and
> resolved with X = 0; `triggerCandidate` now asks for payment whenever the cost has `resourcesX`, as the window-event
> path already did. **Scripted:** `26022.machine-man-interrupt`, off `KNOWN_SKIPPED`.

### 3.37 Interrupts to a side scheme's defeat

Chance Encounter (`vision` 26034, reprinted `fne` 60025): "Interrupt: When attached side scheme is defeated, search your
deck and discard pile for an ally and add it to your hand." Survey (every raw pack, "when attached (side) scheme is
defeated"): Followed (`cap` 03032, `spiderham` 30018), Ambush (`deadpool` 44051), Twisted Reality (`trors` 04135, forced).
`schemeDefeated` was response-only, and the scheme's attachments leave play with it before the response window, so
none of these could fire. **Decision (the RRG-correct one of the two asked about):** give the defeat an interrupt
window, not a `targetHadAttachment` escape hatch. RRG 1.8 "When Defeated Abilities" (p. 48) makes a scheme's own When
Defeated a forced interrupt and says the card "leaves play after its 'When Defeated' ability is resolved", so the
scheme, and everything attached to it, is in play while "when … is defeated" interrupts resolve.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/scheme-defeat-interrupt.test.ts` (1 test: an
> attachment's forced interrupt fires with the scheme still in play, the same ability as a response does not fire, the
> scheme then leaves play; replay deep-equal) and in a real game in `packages/cards/src/wave4/vision/vision-pack-cards.test.ts`
> (Chance Encounter on Crowd Control; Vision thwarts it to 0 and an ally comes to hand). **What landed:**
> `schemeDefeated` is now interruptible (`isAnnouncement`); `applyRemoveThreat` pushes only the event, whose apply
> step (`applySchemeDefeated`) pushes the scheme's When Defeated and its leave-play step (the flip-guard from §3.10
> kept), so the order is: interrupts → When Defeated → leaves play (attachments with it) → responses. A scheme an
> interrupt already removed does nothing more. **Scripted:** `26034.chance-encounter-interrupt`, off `KNOWN_SKIPPED`
> (Vision now has none). **Fixed on the way:** Twisted Reality (`trors` 04135) was scripted as a forced _response_
> and never fired; it is now the forced interrupt it prints. Followed (`cap` 03032) was already an interrupt and now
> actually fires. Ambush (`deadpool`) and the `fne` Chance Encounter are not scripted yet.

### 3.38 Resources generated by reading the table

Energy Duplication (`mts` 21006): "Hero Resource: Exhaust Energy Duplication → generate the printed resource on your
faceup energy form upgrade." Band Together (`mts` 21018, a resource card): "This card generates [wild] for each ally you
control (to a maximum of 3)." Survey (every raw pack, "generate … resource … on / for each"): Storm's Crown (`storm`
36006, "the printed resource on your [Weather] support"); Cat's Head Amulet (`cw` 56004, "[physical] for each minion
engaged with you, to a maximum of 3"); Olympus (`hercules` 59012, "[wild] for each [Gift] card you control"); Titanium
Muscles (`mut_gen` 32005, "for each tough status card on Colossus", a status count, not a card count: not covered);
Montage (`deadpool` 44007, "1 additional [wild] for each acceleration token", additive: not covered).

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/resource-generation-read.test.ts` (2 tests: "[wild]
> for each ally you control, to a maximum of 3" at 0, 2 and 5 allies; "the printed resource on" a named card, none
> without it) and in real games in `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/spectrum-kit.test.ts` (Energy Duplication generates
> Gamma's [physical], nothing with every form facedown) and `spectrum-pack-cards.test.ts` (Band Together is worth one
> [wild] per ally Spectrum controls). **What landed:** two `ResourceGeneration` variants read when the resource is
> generated: **`printedResourcesOf {cards}`** and **`perCard {resource, per, max?}`**; `generatedResources` now takes
> the generating card and its user (every caller passes them). **`ConstantTrigger.handGenerates`**: what a card
> generates when spent from hand instead of its printed resources (read by `handCardResources`). `generatedResources`
> and `handCardResources` are exported. **DSL:** `printedResourcesOf(query)`, `generatesPerCard(resource, query, max?)`,
> `constant({ handGenerates })`. **Scripted:** `21006.energy-duplication-resource`, `21018.band-together-constant`,
> off `KNOWN_SKIPPED`.

### 3.39 A keyword granted until a duration ends

Pulsar Shield (`mts` 21009): "… If you were already in Pulsar energy form, she gains retaliate 1 until the end of the
phase." Survey (every raw pack, "gain(s) [keyword] … until"): Cuts Both Ways (`cw` 56050, "you gain retaliate 1 until
the end of the phase"); Claw Mastery (`x23` 43005, "her attacks gain overkill" until the end of the round, an attack
keyword, which the existing attack-keyword grants cover).

> **Status: landed (2026-09-24),** tested in `packages/engine/src/keyword-until.test.ts` (1 test: the identity has
> retaliate 1 for the rest of the phase and not after, replay deep-equal) and in a real game in
> `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/spectrum-kit.test.ts` (Spectrum already in Pulsar defends Rhino's attack with Pulsar
> Shield; Rhino takes the retaliate damage, and with a retaliate 0 grant he does not). **What landed:**
> **`EffectSpec grantKeywordUntil {keyword, target?, affects?, until}`**, a lasting `keywordGrant` read by
> `grantedKeywords` beside constant grants, expiring like the other lasting effects. **DSL:** `gainKeywordUntil(keyword,
> target, until)`. **Scripted:** `21009.pulsar-shield-interrupt`, off `KNOWN_SKIPPED`.

### 3.40 Scenario rules with no card behind them

MC21 p. 6 (Ebony Maw): "When a player reveals a Spell environment, they place that card in front of them in their play
area." A rulebook rule printed on no card, so the §3.16 `entersRevealersPlayArea` RuleSpec had nothing to hang on. No
earlier scenario did this: wave 3's Collection rules are printed on the Collector's own cards. Other rulebook-only
rules the same field can carry as they are reached: any scenario insert rule expressible as a `RuleSpec`.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/spell-environments.test.ts` (1 new test: with the
> rule seeded at setup and no card granting it, a revealed Spell goes to the revealer's play area; without it, to the
> villain's area) and in real games in `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/ebony-maw.test.ts` (the Ebony Maw scenario
> carries the rule; Attack on Knowhere 1B's When Revealed puts a Spell into the player's area at setup and none into
> the villain's area; Channeling Trance with no Spell in your play area puts one there). **What landed:**
> **`GameSetupConfig.scenarioRuleSpecs: RuleSpec[]`**, stored as **`ScenarioRules.rules`** and read by `activeRules`
> like a constant on a card in play, with no card as "self" and nobody as "you" (the state-check gates for
> `controlledByFirstPlayer` and `focusedMainScheme` see them too). `putIntoPlay` of an encounter card already routes
> through the reveal placement, so "puts that card into play in their play area" follows the rule as well.
> **Cards:** `wave4/setup.ts` keeps `SCENARIO_RULE_SPECS` by scenario id, and `mts/ebony-maw.ts` exports
> `EBONY_MAW_SCENARIO_RULES`. **Scripted:** 21072/21073 `.when-revealed`, `21074b.when-revealed`,
> `21075a.when-revealed`, `21081.when-revealed`, all off `KNOWN_SKIPPED`. Two existing Ebony Maw tests were adjusted:
> the setup Spell now exists (pick the newly revealed copy; start the scheme at 0 so the phase cannot complete 1B),
> and a filler goes under a staged Spell so its surge cannot reveal Channeling Trance.

### 3.41 A stat totalled over several cards

Mass Attack (`mts` 21016): "Hero Action (attack): Exhaust 3 allies you control that share a [Trait] with your hero → deal
X damage to an enemy, where X is the total ATK of those allies and your hero." The three allies are one multi-card cost
pick; `statOf` read only the first card. Survey (every raw pack, "total ATK/THW/SCH"): Fastball Special (`wolv` 35023,
"the total ATK of Colossus and Wolverine"), Partnership of Pain (`sm` 27111, "the total SCH of all other villains");
Exodus's "his total ATK" is one card. "Share a trait with your hero" is the existing `TargetQuery.sharesTraitWith`.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/stat-total.test.ts` (1 test: `total` sums the stat
> over every card the ref names; without it, the first card) and in a real game in
> `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/spectrum-pack-cards.test.ts` (Spectrum exhausts Blue Marvel, Kaluu and Blade for Mass
> Attack; Rhino takes their ATK plus hers). **What landed:** **`ValueSpec stat.total`**. **DSL:** `totalStatOf(ref,
> stat)`. **Scripted:** `21016.mass-attack-action` (`exhaustCardsCost` of 3 allies sharing a trait with your identity,
> bound to `allies`), off `KNOWN_SKIPPED`.

### 3.42 A deck-discard cost sized by the triggering event

Shield Spell (`mts` 21061): "Hero Interrupt (defense): When you would take any amount of damage from an attack, discard
that many cards from the top of your deck → prevent all damage from this attack." A cost sized by the triggering event;
`AbilityCost.discardFromDeck` was a fixed number.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in a real game in `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/adam-warlock-pack-cards.test.ts`
> (Adam Warlock takes Rhino's attack undefended and plays Shield Spell: exactly that many cards leave his deck and the
> whole amount is prevented). **What landed:** **`AbilityCost.discardFromDeck: number | ValueSpec`**; a value is read
> against the event of the innermost open window (the one the ability is used in), both when the cost is checked
> (enough cards in the deck) and when it is paid (`actions.ts deckDiscardCount`); outside a window it reads with no
> event. **DSL:** `discardTopOfDeckCost(eventAmount)`. **Scripted:** `21061.shield-spell-interrupt`, off
> `KNOWN_SKIPPED`.

### 3.43 A branch's bindings reach the effects after it

The scripter's question: a `selectCards` (or any) binding made inside a `chooseOne` option, which runs as a child frame,
was not visible to a sibling effect after the `chooseOne`; the same held for `if` branches. It failed silently (an
empty slot: 0 damage, nothing moved). **Decision: propagate.** Printed text reads that way ("Choose one: … . Then …
the card discarded this way"), only one branch runs so the binding is well defined, and a slot no taken branch bound
still reads empty, which is what "if you discarded one" wants. Rejecting it in the validator would have forced every
such card to duplicate its tail into each branch.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/branch-bindings.test.ts` (2 tests: a binding made in
> a `chooseOne` option and in an `if` branch is read by the effect after it; both fail without the change). **What
> landed:** an effects frame pushed for a branch carries **`returnBindingsTo`** (the frame that ran it); when the
> branch finishes, its bindings and vars are written back to that frame (`chooseOne`, its multi-pick form, and `if`).
> **Scan of every registered script** (`WAVE4_DEPS`, which includes Core through wave 4) for an effect that reads a
> slot bound only inside an earlier `chooseOne`/`if` branch: one hit, Adam Warlock (`stld` 17011), a false positive
> (each later branch rebinds `scheme`/`enemy` before reading it). No other script had the latent bug; the four the
> scripter already restructured (Magic Attack, Zone of Silence, Karmic Blast, Cosmic Awareness) are correct as they
> are and can be simplified if wanted. Full suite unchanged.

### 3.44 Players cannot discard these cards

Powerful Enchantments (`valk` 25030): "Players cannot discard attachments that are attached to friendly characters."
`cannotLeavePlay` is too strong: the host's defeat must still discard them, and so must an encounter card's own effect.
Survey (every raw pack, "cannot discard" / "cannot be discarded"): Mission Team (`aoa` 45171, "cannot be discarded", an
absolute rule `cannotLeavePlay`-shaped, not this).

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/players-cannot-discard.test.ts` (2 tests: a player's
> event cannot discard the attachment on their hero, and says why; an encounter treachery's When Revealed still
> discards it) and in a real game in `packages/cards/src/wave4/valk/valkyrie-obligation-nemesis.test.ts` (with
> Powerful Enchantments in play, Lethal Weapon's own "discard this attachment" leaves it on Valkyrie; without, it goes).
> **What landed:** **`RuleSpec playersCannotDiscard {target, while?}`**, read by `discardFromPlay` and by
> `moveCards … "discard"` when the effects frame is **`byPlayer`**. `byPlayer` is set when an ability frame pushes its
> effects: an ability on a player card, an action or resource ability, or an optional interrupt or response (a forced
> ability, When Revealed, boost or setup on an encounter card is not a player's), and it carries into `chooseOne`/`if`
> branches. Game event `discardRefused`. **DSL:** `constant(playersCannotDiscard(query))`. **Scripted:**
> `25030.powerful-enchantments-constant` (attachments whose host is an identity or an ally a player controls), off
> `KNOWN_SKIPPED`; Valkyrie now has none. **Not covered:** a protected card paid as a cost (a "discard this card →"
> cost on an encounter attachment, or an in-play discard cost); no printed card combines the two.

### 3.45 A revealed treachery that moved itself stays where it went

Engine bug (Field Recruitment, `hood` 24012, "… Remove this card from the game."): the reveal's finish step discarded
any treachery that still existed after its When Revealed, even one an effect had already moved, so "remove this card
from the game" did not stick. RRG 1.8 "Treachery" (p. 45) discards the card after it resolves, which says nothing
about a card its own text sent elsewhere.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/reveal-self-move.test.ts` (3 tests: "remove this card
> from the game" sticks; "shuffle it into the encounter deck" sticks; a treachery that did not move itself is still
> discarded) and in a real game in `packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/hood.test.ts` (Field Recruitment ends in
> `removedFromGame`). **What landed:** the reveal frame records **`revealedFrom`**, the zone the card was in when its
> reveal began; at the finish a treachery (or revealed event, §3.14) is discarded only if it is still there. A card
> revealed from the top of the encounter deck (`revealEncounterCard`) is now parked with the revealing player's dealt
> encounter cards while it resolves, as `revealCard` already did, so a When Revealed that shuffles it back into the
> deck is a visible move. **Existing cards checked** (every registered script, Core through wave 4, 1,523 cards, for a
> treachery whose own When Revealed moves itself; and the raw text of every pack): only Field Recruitment is scripted
> and affected. Infiltration and Shapeshifter Surprise (`mut_gen` 32082, 32083), Misled (`rogue` 38027) and Smear
> Campaign (`sm` 27175) print the same shape and are not scripted yet; they get the right behavior when they are.
> The full suite is unchanged.

### 3.46 Per-player snapshots; each player resolving a Special as themself

Promised Prosperity (`hood` 24005b): "When Revealed: Each player must resolve The Hood's 'Foul Play' ability in player
order. For each player who was not dealt at least 1 facedown encounter card this way, place 2 threat here." Two gaps:
nothing could measure, per player, what a nested resolution dealt them; and **a bug found on the way**: inside
`forEachPlayer`, `resolveSpecials` gave an uncontrolled card's Special the _calling_ ability's "you" (the first player),
not the player whose pass it was, so every "each player must resolve Foul Play" dealt every card to the same player.
Survey (every raw pack, "each player who was not / did not … this way"): Hail Hydra! (`cap` 03030, `trors` 04057/04147,
"each player who was not attacked this way"), "It's Alive!" (`aos` 50123, "each player who did not engage a minion this
way"): the same snapshot-and-compare shape.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/per-player-snapshot.test.ts` (1 test, exact threat:
> +4 when neither of two players is dealt a card, +2 when one is, 0 when both are; each player's Foul Play deals to
> that player) and in a real game in `packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/hood.test.ts` (two players at Making Connections
> advance to Promised Prosperity; between the advance and the next step, neither player's Foul Play deals to the
> other; this test fails with the old "you"). **What landed:** **`EffectSpec setVar {name, value}`** (a snapshot for a
> later comparison in the same ability; `varOf(name)` reads it) and **`resolveSpecials.player`** (the resolving
> player for a Special on a card with no controller). **DSL:** `setVar(name, value)`, `resolveSpecialsOf(ref,
> player?)`. **Scripted:** `24005b.when-revealed` is now complete (forEachPlayer: `setVar("dealtBefore",
> dealtEncounterCount(thatPlayer))`, that player's Foul Play, `ifThen(valueAtMost(dealtEncounterCount(thatPlayer),
> varOf("dealtBefore")), placeThreat(2, self))`). Every "each player must resolve Foul Play" in `hood.ts` (Promised
> Prosperity, Crime State 24006a/b, Unbridled Ambition) now passes `thatPlayer`.

### 3.47 A product of values; Hela's scaling and expert villain

Hela (`mts` 21136a standard, 21137a expert): "Hela gets +1 SCH, +1 ATK and +2[per_hero] (+3[per_hero]) hit points for
each side scheme in victory display." The hit points are the product of two values known only when read (a
per-player amount and a live count); `scaled.times` was a constant. Also in this batch: Odin's King side (21139b)
"Forced Interrupt: When Odin leaves play, remove him from the game" registered as engine-covered, and the `hela`
scenario's `expertVillains` (21137a) added to the data.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/stat-total.test.ts` (1 new test: `product` multiplies
> its parts) and in real games in `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/hela.test.ts`: exact Hela hit points, ATK and SCH at
> 0, 1 and 2 side schemes in victory display with 1 and 2 players (standard +2 per player per scheme, expert +3,
> expert games reading 21137a from the data), and Odin on his King side, defeated defending Hela's attack, ends in
> `removedFromGame` without the game being lost. **What landed:** **`ValueSpec product {values}`**; DSL
> `product(...)`. **Scripted:** `21136a.hela-constant`, `21137a.hela-constant` (`gets("hp", product(perHero(N),
> victoryDisplayCount(sideScheme)), self)` beside the SCH/ATK grants); `21139b.odin-forced-interrupt` is
> `coveredByEngineRule()` (the double-sided `leavePlay` rule, §3.8), all off `KNOWN_SKIPPED`. **Data:**
> `curation/mts.ts` gives `hela` `expertVillains: { villainCardCode: "21137a" }`; mts re-emitted offline (one line in
> `src/data/mts/scenarios.ts`); the hand-built expert configs in `hela.test.ts` / `hela-e2e.test.ts` are gone, and
> `wave4/setup.ts` already reads the field.

### 3.48 An advance to a set-aside villain does not pre-empt the card's When Defeated

Rules bug (Loki, `mts`): All Hail King Loki 1B's "Forced Interrupt: When Loki is defeated, advance to a random set-aside
Loki villain" and that Loki's own "When Defeated: discard cards … until a side scheme is discarded; reveal it" are both
forced interrupts to the same defeat (RRG 1.8 "When Defeated Abilities", p. 48: "equivalent to 'Forced Interrupt: When
this card is defeated…'"; every When Defeated on the card resolves). The advance exchanged the card and reset the dial
inside the defeat's interrupt window, so the defeat sweep never reached `defeatVillainStage`, and the Loki's own When
Defeated only fired when no set-aside Loki remained.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/villain-swap.test.ts` (1 new test: a Loki defeated with
> others set aside resolves his When Defeated, the next Loki comes in, he is in the victory display, replay
> deep-equal; it fails without the fix) and in a real game in `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/loki.test.ts` (Loki I
> defeated with others set aside: his When Defeated reveals Madness on Midgard, a set-aside Loki takes over at full
> health, Loki I is in the victory display, the game goes on). **What landed:** `advanceToSetAsideVillain` reads the
> defeated card's own When Defeated abilities _before_ the exchange and returns them (bound to the defeated card's
> instance, now in the victory display) ahead of the new card's When Revealed; it is handed the defeat event. **Other
> cards checked** (every forced interrupt to a villain's defeat, Core through wave 4): only Loki advances to a set-aside
> villain. Collector (`gmw`) and Hela flip "instead", a replacement of the defeat, so their card's When Defeated
> correctly does not resolve; Kang has no villain-defeat interrupt. See §4 Q22 for the order.

### 3.49 Shuffling a scenario deck's discard pile back in on demand

Infinite Mischief (`mts` 21175): "When Revealed: Shuffle the infinity stone deck discard pile into the infinity stone
deck and reveal the top card." An on-demand shuffle of a shared scenario deck's discard pile into itself, distinct from
the automatic empty-deck reset (`ScenarioDeckState.whenEmpty`); `CardDestination` had `encounterDeckShuffle` and the
per-player `separateDeckShuffle` only.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/set-deck-and-run-out.test.ts` (1 new test: the
> discarded stone returns to the Infinity Stone deck, which is shuffled) and in a real game in
> `packages/cards/src/wave4/mts/loki.test.ts` (with two stones in the Infinity Stone discard pile, Infinite Mischief
> leaves it empty, the stones are back in the deck or revealed into play). **What landed:** **`CardDestination
> "scenarioDeckShuffle"`**: a card whose home is a scenario deck goes back into it, and each deck touched is shuffled
> (`deckShuffled` with the scenario deck's zone); any other card is left where it is. **Scripted:**
> `21175.when-revealed` (`moveCards(scenarioDeck(STONE_DECK, { zones: ["discard"] }), "scenarioDeckShuffle")`, then
> reveal the top card), off `KNOWN_SKIPPED`.

### 3.50 A nemesis set's only minion is its nemesis minion

Seek and Destroy (`hood` 24031, Expert II): "Search the encounter deck, discard pile, and set-aside area for your nemesis
minion and put it into play engaged with you." `TargetQuery.nemesisMinionOf` (wave 2 §17.1) required the card data's
`nemesisMinion` flag, which only a set with several minions prints ("(Captain America's nemesis minion.)"). RRG 1.8
"Nemesis Encounter Set" (p. 30): "An identity's 'nemesis minion' is the minion belonging to that identity's nemesis set.
If a nemesis set has multiple minions in it, the 'nemesis minion' is designated by parenthetical text". Every Core
nemesis set has one minion and no parenthetical, so Seek and Destroy (and Kang's Wrath 4B, 11013b) found nothing for a
Core hero. Survey (every raw pack, "your nemesis minion" / "their nemesis minion"): Kang's Wrath 4B, Seek and Destroy,
Face the Past (`magneto` 49022), Summoned Back (`mts` 21188), Old Grudge (`sm` 27172), Nano-Sentinel Tech (`mut_gen`
32170), all "search … for your nemesis minion", which this query answers for any hero's set.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/hood-primitives.test.ts` (2 tests: a lone unflagged
> minion of the player's nemesis set matches; with a second unflagged minion neither does) and in a real game in
> `packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/standard-expert-ii.test.ts` (Seek and Destroy puts Spider-Man's set-aside Vulture into
> play engaged with him, the rest of his nemesis set stays set aside; with Vulture already in play nothing enters).
> **What landed:** `nemesisMinionOf` accepts a minion without the flag when it is the only minion card of that nemesis
> set in the card pool (`soleMinionOfSet`, `select.ts`, cached per pool). A flagged minion matches as before; the

### 3.51 An attack an effect initiates carries its own keywords

Total Annihilation (`hood` 24054, Standard II): "When Revealed (Hero): The villain attacks you. That attack gains
overkill." Scripted as `enemyAttack(...)` then `modifyAttack({ overkill: true })`, the second effect runs only after the
attack the first one pushed has resolved completely (the stack is last-in first-out), so no attack is in progress and
the keyword is lost. **An engine-visible bug in two landed scripts with the same shape:** Avatar of Death (`mts`
21120, "That attack gains overkill and piercing") and Calvin Zabo (`hood` 24034, "+2 ATK. That attack gains overkill")
never had the keywords; their tests only asserted that the ability fired or that damage was dealt. Survey (every raw
pack, "attacks you … That attack gains"): those three; the interrupt forms ("When X attacks, … That attack gains",
Fanaticism, Warbringer, Sandman) modify the attack in progress and are right as `modifyAttack`.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/hood-primitives.test.ts` (3 tests: a treachery's
> overkill attack of 4 against a 3-hit-point defending ally spills 1 onto the hero, the same attack without the
> keyword spills nothing, replay deep-equal) and in real games in `standard-expert-ii.test.ts` (Total Annihilation's
> attack of 3 against Black Cat at 1 remaining deals Spider-Man the excess 2; as a boost card, "if the villain is
> attacking, this attack gains overkill" spills 1). **What landed:** **`EffectSpec enemyAttack.keywords?:
> AttackKeyword[]`**, carried on each activation the effect initiates as the same vars `modifyAttack` sets (so
> `attackKeywordsOf` reads them), scoped exactly like `atkBonus`. **DSL:** `enemyAttack(enemies, { keywords })`.
> **Re-scripted:** `24054.when-revealed-hero`, `21120.when-revealed-hero`, `24034.when-revealed`.

### 3.52 Increasing an in-flight damage amount; "stunned" by the rules

Beast Mode (`hood` 24014): "Forced Interrupt: When a stunned or confused friendly character would take any amount of
damage, increase that amount by 1." Controller (24024): "[star] Forced Interrupt: When Controller's attack would deal any
amount of damage to a character, increase that amount by that character's ATK." `preventDamage` lowers the pending amount
of the interrupted `dealDamage` event; nothing raised it, and replacing the event would lose its source, attack flag and
keywords. Survey (every raw pack, "increase that amount"): these two and Follow Through (`gmw` 16045, excess damage,
already the constant `excessDamageBonus`, wave 3 §3.18). Beast Mode also needs "stunned" read by the rules: RRG 1.8
"Steady" (p. 41), "That character is not stunned unless they have two stunned status cards", and Warehouse District
(24063, the same pack) gives every character steady; `Predicate hasStatus` only asked whether a status card is there.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/hood-primitives.test.ts` (3 tests: a stunned hero takes
> the villain's 2 plus 2 as one `damageDealt` from the villain, with a `damageIncreased` log entry; no status, no
> increase; with steady one stun card is not stunned and two are) and in real games in
> `packages/cards/src/wave4/hood/hood-gaps.test.ts` (Beast Mode: a stunned Spider-Man takes The Hood's 1 + 1 boost + 1 =
> 3, unstunned 2, with Warehouse District's steady and one stun card 2; Controller: undefended 1 + Spider-Man's ATK 2 =
> 3, defended by Daredevil 1 + his ATK 2 = 3 to Daredevil). **What landed:** **`EffectSpec increaseDamage { amount }`**
> (the mirror of `preventDamage`; log `damageIncreased { targetInstanceId, amount }`) and **`Predicate hasStatus.active`**
> (`statusActive`, steady-aware). Plain `hasStatus` is unchanged (it counts status cards, and constant grants read it,
> where a steady-aware read could re-enter the keyword scan). **DSL:** `increaseDamage(n)`, `isStunned(ref)`,
> `isConfused(ref)`. **Scripted:** `24014.beast-mode-forced-interrupt`, `24024.controller-forced-interrupt`.

### 3.53 A granted keyword whose number is read live

Mandrill (`hood` 24016): "Mandrill gains retaliate X, where X is equal to the number of confused characters (friendly or
enemy) in play." `KeywordGrantSpec` carried a printed `KeywordInstance`. Survey ("gains retaliate X" and other numbered
keywords with an X): Mandrill and Head of Steam (`next_evol` 40123, "retaliate X, where X is the number of momentum
counters on Juggernaut").

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `hood-primitives.test.ts` (1 test: retaliate X is the number of minions in
> play, 0 → no keyword, 1, 2) and in `hood-gaps.test.ts` (Mandrill: no confused character, no retaliate; one, 1; two,
> 2). **What landed:** **`KeywordGrantSpec.value?: ValueSpec`**, read from the granting card's point of view in place of
> `keyword.value`; 0 or less grants nothing. While one live value is read, other live-valued grants are skipped (a
> re-entrancy guard in `keywords.ts`, so an X that asks about keywords cannot loop). Mandrill's "confused" counts a
> confused status card (`TargetQuery.hasStatus`), not the steady-aware reading §3.52 gives predicates: a steady
> character with one confused card still counts (no card composes the two yet). **DSL:** `gainsKeywordX(name, value,
> target)`. **Scripted:** `24016.mandrill-constant`.

### 3.54 "Repeat this effect"; a card's own damage reports the defeat it caused

Out for Blood (`hood` 24023): "Deal 1 damage to the friendly character with the fewest remaining hit points. If that
character is defeated this way, repeat this effect." Two gaps: no effect re-ran itself on its own outcome, and **a bug
found on the way**: a card's own `dealDamage` never reported a defeat to its `bind` (`<bind>.defeated`), because the
defeat reported only to the damage's parent, which a card effect's damage does not have (an attack's does). Survey
("repeat this effect", "repeat this", "do this again"): Out for Blood only in the raw data; the defeat report also serves
every "if that character is defeated this way" after a plain `dealDamage`.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `hood-primitives.test.ts` (2 tests: two allies at 1 remaining are defeated in
> turn and then the hero takes 1 and it stops; an always-true condition stops after `REPEAT_LIMIT` = 50 repetitions)
> and in `hood-gaps.test.ts` (Out for Blood defeats Black Cat at 1 remaining, repeats onto Spider-Man, stops; as a boost
> card, the same). **What landed:** **`EffectSpec repeatWhile { effects, while }`**: the effects, then `while` read in
> the same frame (it sees their bindings); each repetition starts with the slots and vars the effects bind cleared.
> **`characterDefeated.reportFrameId`**: the damage event's own frame hears "defeated" as well as its parent. **DSL:**
> `repeatWhile(condition, ...effects)`; the validator reads `while` after walking the effects. **Scripted:**
> `24023.when-revealed` (a tie for fewest is the first player's pick, RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 19).

### 3.55 "The highest-cost card from your hand"

Feisty Heist (`hood` 24055): "When Revealed: Discard the highest-cost card from your hand." Recorded as a gap ("no
TargetQuery → hand bridge"), but the bridge is there: `selectCards` binds the hand as a slot, `TargetRef.superlative`
takes a slot as its pool ("a slot an earlier `selectCards` bound for cards out of play", wave 1 §3.12), and
`discardFromHand`'s `filter` accepts `inSlot`, so the discard is a real discard among the tied cards. Other cards: Burn
Notice (`bkw`, the in-play form), and any "the highest/lowest-cost card in your hand".

> **Status: checked (2026-09-25), no engine change,** tested in `hood-gaps.test.ts` (Avengers Mansion, cost 4, is
> discarded from a hand of 5; with Helicarrier and Swinging Web Kick tied at 3, exactly one of them). A tie is chosen by
> the player whose hand it is (`discardFromHand` asks them), not the first player: see §4 Q24. **Scripted:**
> `24055.when-revealed`.

### 3.56 Resolving a card's "When Revealed" abilities on demand

Citywide Crisis (`hood` 24059): "When Revealed: Resolve each 'When Revealed' ability on each side scheme in play. If no
'When Revealed' ability was resolved this way, place 2 threat on each scheme. [star] Boost: Resolve this card's 'When
Revealed' ability." `resolveSpecials` resolved `special` abilities only. Survey ("Resolve … 'When Revealed'", 15
printings): the boost "Resolve this card's 'When Revealed' ability" (Out for Blood, Double Trouble 24017, Sandslide
27070, For Whom the Bell Tolls 27083, A.I.M. Interference 50184a–c), "Resolve the 'When Revealed' ability of each minion
in play" (Mighty Avengers 56076/56081, Teenage Superheroes 57058), Moon Knight 57065 (the topmost treachery in the
discard pile), Scarlet Witch 58014. RRG 1.8 "Incite X" (p. 24) and "Surge" (p. 42) each call the keyword "equivalent to
the following triggered ability: 'When Revealed: …'".

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `hood-primitives.test.ts` (2 tests: a side scheme's own When Revealed, its
> incite 2 and its surge all resolve and the fallback does not; with nothing to resolve the fallback places 5) and in
> `hood-gaps.test.ts` (Disaster at the Docks' "take 3 indirect damage" resolves again; with only Unbridled Ambition in
> play, 2 threat on the main scheme and on it; as a boost card, the Docks deal 3 again). **What landed:**
> **`resolveSpecials.trigger?: "special" | "whenRevealed"`** and **`resolveSpecials.bind`** (`<bind>.count`).
> **Changed 2026-09-25 (§4 Q23, user decision):** `"whenRevealed"` resolves the printed When Revealed abilities only
> (the controller orders several), and only they count toward `<bind>.count`. **`resolveSpecials.includeKeywords?:
> boolean`** (default off) also resolves each card's incite (placeThreat on the main scheme, sourced by that card) and
> surge (reveal the top card), in a reveal's own order: incite, the printed abilities, surge, each counting as one; no
> card uses it yet. A card's "this card gains surge" has no reveal of its own to change when resolved this way.
> **DSL:** `resolveWhenRevealedOf(ref, { bind, includeKeywords })`. **Scripted:** `24059.when-revealed`, `24059.boost`,
> `24023.boost` (all default: printed abilities only; neither Citywide Crisis nor Out for Blood has incite or surge of
> its own, so the two boosts are unchanged). **Tests now:** `hood-primitives.test.ts` 5 under §3.56 (default: a side
> scheme's printed ability resolves but not its incite 2 or surge, and no fallback; a side scheme with only incite and
> surge resolves nothing, so the fallback places 5 and no card is revealed; `includeKeywords`: all three resolve, and
> incite plus surge alone count; nothing at all: the fallback places 5); `hood-gaps.test.ts` adds Disaster at the Docks
> beside Beast Mode (no When Revealed): the Docks deal 3, no fallback threat, only Citywide Crisis is revealed.

### 3.57 Icons gained from constant abilities

Secret Lair (`hood` 24061): "Each enemy in play gains 1 acceleration icon." RRG 1.8 "Acceleration Icon" (p. 5): "place X
additional threat on the main scheme, where X is the number of acceleration icons in play"; the engine counted only the
icons printed on schemes. Survey ("gains … acceleration icon" / "hazard icon" / "crisis icon"): Coordinated Effort (`sm`
27143), Mad Science (`aos` 50085), Bora (`spdr` 30031), Mojo in the Middle (`mojo` 39060), Rule by Force (`sm` 29029,
"this card gains a hazard icon" / "an acceleration icon").

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `hood-primitives.test.ts` (3 tests: step one places the stage's 1 plus 1 per
> enemy; the villain-phase audit agrees; a gained crisis icon stops a thwart of the main scheme) and in
> `hood-gaps.test.ts` (Secret Lair with The Hood and Beetle in play: step one places exactly 2 more). **What landed:**
> **`RuleSpec gainsIcon { icon, target, count?, while? }`**; `grantedIcons` / `iconsInPlay` (`rules.ts`) are read by step
> one, the hazard deal, both crisis checks and `villain/audit.ts` (the audit's second borrowed engine rule, beside the
> stage's acceleration). **DSL:** `gainsIcon(icon, target, count?)`. **Scripted:** `24061.secret-lair-constant` (and the
> card's `when-revealed` and `-constant-2`, reusable as is).

### 3.58 "Attach to X. If you cannot, …" as a When Revealed

Flamethrower and Holoshield Generator (`hood` 24037, 24038): "Attach to the minion with the most remaining hit points. If
you cannot, search the encounter deck and discard pile for a minion, put it into play engaged with you, and attach this
card to it. (Shuffle.)"; Jetpack and Tech Gauntlets (24039, 24040): "… If you cannot, this card gains surge." The host is
data (`attachesTo`); the fallback is a When Revealed read after the engine tried to attach (`Predicate isAttached`, the
Goblin Glider precedent, `wave1/gob`). **A scripting bug found on the way:** Jetpack's and Tech Gauntlets' `-constant`
refs were `coveredByEngineRule()`, but no engine rule gives surge to an unattached attachment (RRG 1.8 "Attach To": it is
discarded), and Holoshield Generator's fallback sentence had been scripted as its stat grant. Flamethrower's "attached
minion's attacks deal indirect damage" is wave 3's `attacksDealIndirectDamage` (§3.16 there) with `attacker: {
hostOfSelf: true }`.

> **Status: checked (2026-09-25), no engine change,** tested in `hood-gaps.test.ts` (Flamethrower on Armored Guard: its
> attack of 1 + 3 is indirect, one prompt for 4; with no minion in play, Flamethrower and Holoshield Generator each

> Gauntlets with no minion surge, Jetpack with Armored Guard in play attaches and does not). **DSL:** `isAttached(ref)`
> (was local to two modules). **Scripted:** `24037.flamethrower-constant`, `-constant-2`,

> `24039.jetpack-constant`, `24040.tech-gauntlets-constant`.

### 3.59 "If no minion was put into play this way"

Crime Pays (`hood` 24042): "Search the encounter deck for a [Criminal] minion and put it into play engaged with you.
(Shuffle.) If no minion was put into play this way, this card gains surge." A search can find nothing, and a found
unique minion can be turned away by the unique rule, so "put into play" is what `putIntoPlay` reports, not what was
selected. Survey ("was put into play this way" / "does not enter"): Crime Pays, Sinister Beatdown (`sm` 27101a,
villains), Surprise! (`sm` 27112), Shadow of the Past (Core, "If your nemesis minion does not enter the game this way",
today read from the selected count).

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `hood-primitives.test.ts` (2 tests: a minion that enters counts and there is
> no surge; a unique minion already in play is turned away, `uniqueEntryBlocked`, and the card surges) and in
> `hood-gaps.test.ts` (Crime Pays puts one Criminal minion into play engaged with P1 and does not surge; with no
> Criminal minion left in the deck nothing enters and it surges). **What landed:** **`putIntoPlay.bind`**: the cards now
> in play to slot `bind`, their number to `<bind>.count`. **DSL:** `putIntoPlay(card, controller, { bind })`.
> **Scripted:** `24042.when-revealed`; White Rabbit's boost `24047.boost` is `discardFromHand` with `identitySetOf: you`
> (wave 2, reusable as is).

### 3.60 "If no tough status card was given this way"

Magic Muscle (`hood` 24070): "When Revealed: Give each [Brute] enemy in play a tough status card. If no tough status
card was given this way, discard cards from the top of the encounter deck until a [Brute] minion is discarded and
reveal that minion." A character holds at most one tough card (RRG 1.8 "Status Cards"), and `giveStatus` gives nothing
to one already at capacity, so "given" is what the give reports, not whether a Brute exists. **A scripting bug found in
QA (docs/phase7-wave4-qa.md Checkpoint 7):** 24070 was `ifThen(exists(BRUTE_ENEMY), giveTough(...), [fallback])`, so a
lone Brute already holding a tough card made the card do nothing. Survey ("given this way" / "status card … given" in
every raw pack): Magic Muscle and Tough It Out (`nova` 28032, "If 1 or fewer tough status cards were given this way,
this card gains surge", not yet scripted). The "if it is already stunned/confused" cards (Electric Arrow, Scorpion,
Senyaka, Upside the Head, …) are a pre-check on the target, not a count, and Uncanny Resilience (`twc` 07045, "If no
status cards were removed") is already read as "none held" before the removal.

> **Status: landed (2026-09-25),** tested in `packages/engine/src/give-status-bind.test.ts` (3 tests: two minions with
> none given 2 and skip the fallback; one already tough gives 1 and skips it; both already tough give 0, and the
> fallback runs) and in `wrecking-crew.test.ts` (the former `it.fails` pin, now a plain `it`: Wrecker already tough,
> Magic Muscle discards to Piledriver and reveals it). **What landed:** **`giveStatus.bind`**: `<bind>.amount` is how
> many status cards were given, summed over the targets; the DSL validator knows the binding. **DSL:**

## 4. Open questions (for the user or FFG)

Each is implemented the way stated, or not at all, and named here rather than decided silently.

1. **Changing to an energy form while in another** (§3.1). The cards say "flip that card faceup to change to that energy
   form"; neither MC21 nor the RRG says the old form turns facedown. Implemented as: one energy form faceup at a time
   (the previous one turns facedown), because "If you were already in Gamma energy form" and Energy Duplication's "your
   faceup energy form upgrade" assume one.
2. **"The main scheme" in a player constant with one main scheme and no Focused Defense in play** (§3.2): only arises
   before 2A resolves. Implemented as the central scheme.
3. **Loki's damage on a defeat-advance** (§3.7). MC21 p. 24 transfers "counters, and tokens" to the new Loki on defeat;
   RRG 1.8 "Villain Defeat" (p. 47) carries "non-damage tokens" to a same-title stage and "Excess damage … does not carry
   over". Implemented as: damage does not carry on defeat; on a swap the dial stays (RRG "'Swap'").
4. **Tower Defense's suggested setup damage** (MC21 p. 11) is a difficulty option. Standalone default: none.
   **USER DECISION 2026-09-25:** an option, off by default, that places the printed recommendation. MC21 p. 11,
   "Modular Difficulty" (read from `docs/campaign-modes/mc21_the_mad_titans_shadow_rulebook-compressed.pdf`, page 11;
   the per-hero glyph U+F524 is `[per_hero]`): "If players wish to increase the difficulty of the Tower Defense
   scenario, they may place damage on Avengers Tower during setup. This extra damage represents the effectiveness of
   the Black Order's initial attack on the tower. The amount of damage placed is up to the players as a group, but
   listed below are some recommendations for each difficulty mode: » Standard Mode: Place 1[per_hero] damage.
   » Expert Mode: Place 2[per_hero] damage. » Heroic Mode: Place 3[per_hero] damage." **Implemented as:**
   `@mc/content` `ScenarioSetupOptions { towerDefenseSetupDamage?: true }` (`schema/modes.ts`, a `true`-only flag like
   `PlayModes`), carried by `CoreScenarioOptions.setupOptions` through `playableScenario`/`wave4Scenario`/
   `towerDefenseScenario`. When set, `buildMtsMultipleVillains` adds `towerDefenseSetupDamage(modes)`
   (`mts/tower-defense.ts`): `placeDamage(perHero(n))` on the Avengers Tower environment, n = 3 at any heroic level,
   else 2 in expert, else 1; skirmish is refused (no printed recommendation). Only the printed recommendation is
   offered, not a free amount. Every other scenario refuses the flag (`checkScenarioSetupOptions`). The engine carries
   it as a general primitive, `GameSetupConfig.scenarioSetupInstructions` (plain `EffectSpec` data frozen into
   `ScenarioRules.setupInstructions`, so it replays), resolved in a new setup step `scenarioSetupInstructions` after
   Appendix II step 12's Setup/When Revealed abilities (which put the tower into play) and before step 14's draw,
   traced by a `scenarioSetupInstructionResolved` event. A game without instructions has no new field, step or event.
   Placed damage does not raise the damage-taken event the Stronghold side's forced response is scripted on; that is
   outcome-neutral here (at most 3[per_hero] against its 9[per_hero]). Tests: `engine/src/scenario-setup-
   instructions.test.ts`, `cards/src/wave4/mts/tower-defense-setup-damage.test.ts`. **Client follow-up built (game-
   client-engineer, 2026-09-25):** Table setup (`scenes/table-setup.ts`) shows a toggle, "Black Order's initial
   attack", only for Tower Defense (and only outside skirmish mode, which the client has no picker for yet), off by
   default, labeled with the mode-specific amount ("place N damage per hero on Avengers Tower"). `view/setup-
   draft.ts`'s `SetupDraft.towerDefenseSetupDamage` carries the choice through `toSessionConfig` to
   `SessionConfig.setupOptions`, threaded to the scenario builder by `engine/session-core.ts`'s `scenarioFor`.
   Tests: `view/setup-draft.test.ts`, `engine/session-core.test.ts`.
5. **Standard II / Expert II** replace or join Standard / Expert? **Settled (2026-09-25) from The Hood insert, p. 2,
   "Alternative Sets"** (the insert Hall of Heroes' The Hood page links, `the-hood-pdf.pdf`, read page by page): "In The
   Hood Scenario Pack, there are two alternative encounter sets, Standard II and Expert II. Each encounter set is more
   powerful than its preceding version, offering players the option of a greater challenge. When a scenario requires
   the Standard encounter set, the Standard II encounter set may be used instead. When a scenario requires the Expert
   encounter set (most notably during Expert or Heroic modes of play), the Expert II encounter set may be used instead."
   RRG 1.8 and the post-1.7 rulings never name either set (grepped for "Standard II"/"Expert II"); RRG 1.8 "Modes of
   Play" (p. 28) adds "the Expert encounter set" in expert mode and "Standard Set" (p. 40) says it "is added to most
   scenarios", which the insert's "instead" substitutes into. So: **each is an optional replacement, chosen by the
   players at setup, independently of the other, in any scenario that requires the set it replaces (not only The
   Hood), and never added where no Standard/Expert set is required** (The Wrecking Crew). **Implemented as**
   `DifficultySetChoice { standard?, expert? }` (`@mc/content` `schema/modes.ts`, `difficultyEncounterSetIds`,
   `difficultySetChoiceErrors`), read by every scenario builder through `CoreScenarioOptions.difficultySets` (Core,
   waves 1-4, Tower Defense; wave 4's builders refuse a set of the wrong classification, `checkWave4DifficultySets`).
   **Default: the printed Standard / Expert sets** (absent choice). Expert mode now also reaches the engine from the
   Core, `mts` and Tower Defense builders (`GameSetupConfig.difficulty`), so Standard II's Formidable Foe enters play
   on its Expert face in an expert game on any scenario. **Client:** the setup screen needs two toggles ("Standard II
   instead of Standard", "Expert II instead of Expert", the latter shown only in expert mode), offered once The Hood's
   cards are in the playable pool (§5). Scripted: `hood/standard-expert-ii.ts` (§3.50, §3.51 were found on the way).
6. **An eliminated player in the expert campaign** (§2.2): MC21 p. 25 lets them rejoin "by placing an acceleration token";
   the gate lets them decline the heal and start at 0 hit points. Proposed: an identity whose recorded hit points are 0
   must take the heal. **USER DECISION 2026-09-25:** the heal is mandatory for them. **Implemented** in `mts.ts`'s
   `healToFull` (all four setup heals, MC21 p. 13/17/21/25): `ifThen(campaignLogAtLeast("remainingHp", 1))` offers
   "Heal to full" / "Decline" as before, and otherwise places the acceleration token and heals with no choice. A field
   never written reads 0, which `hpSet` also turns into a 0 dial, so it is forced the same way. Tests:
   `campaigns/mts.qa.test.ts`, "the expert campaign's heal is mandatory …".
7. **Hela's "When Hela is defeated, if Odin is not attached to the main scheme, you win the game"** vs. MC21 p. 20's "If
   the players control the Odin ally when Hela is defeated". Equivalent in every reachable state (Odin is attached or
   controlled by the first player until he leaves play, which loses). Implemented from the card.
8. **Does a bare "You cannot change form" stop an additional form change?** (§3.1) All Tied Up and Care for Cassie
   print it; RRG 1.8 p. 21 says an additional change "does count as changing form for the purpose of triggering card
   effects", which is about triggers, not restrictions. Implemented as: no. A bare rule blocks only the hero/alter-ego
   flip, and "You cannot change energy forms" (Loss of Control) is what blocks energy forms.

9. **Does flipping Avengers Tower to its Damaged side resolve that side's "When Revealed"?** (§3.5) Ruling Jun 25, 2026
   (4) #3 and Jan 26, 2026 (4) #2: "Environments flip, they are not revealed." Yet the only way the Damaged side enters
   play is by that flip, and MC21 p. 11 says its When Revealed "reinforces the unique rule by discarding each other copy
   of Avengers Tower from play". Proposed: follow the rulings (no When Revealed on a flip) and have the Stronghold side's
   script discard the other Avengers Towers as it flips, which is what MC21 p. 11 describes. Needs the user's call.
   **USER DECISION 2026-09-24:** follow the rulings. The flip does not resolve the Damaged side's When Revealed; the
   Stronghold side's script discards the other Towers as it flips (the proposal, kept as is).

10. **Who agrees to spend another player's cards for an alliance card?** (§3.17) RRG 1.8 "Alliance" (p. 6) says any
    player "may help pay", so each contribution is that player's choice. The engine takes one command from the player
    playing the card, naming every card spent, as it already does for the Milano's "for any player" resource. Implemented
    as: the engine accepts it; asking the other seats before the command is sent is a client/netcode step, not an
    engine rule. The order the per-spender `resourcesSpent` events resolve in (the paying player's first, then seat
    order) is our default; no ruling covers it. **USER DECISION 2026-09-25:** each contributing player approves
    their own contribution before the command is sent. **Built (game-client-engineer, 2026-09-25) as a hot-seat
    prompt**, not a netcode request: this build has no multiplayer-netcode layer yet (`engine/host.ts`'s own doc
    comment — a `WorkerEngineHost` off the main thread, not a network host), every seat plays on the one local
    session, and the board's perspective already follows whoever must act (`engine/acting-player.ts`). `view/
    payment-model.ts`'s `allianceHelpersOf` reads, from a `PaymentState`'s current picks, every other seat whose
    hand card or resource ability would be spent (grouped by owner via `controllerOf`, seat order, never the
    payer). `scenes/board/controller.ts`'s `commitPayment` checks this before dispatching: if it's non-empty, a
    new `Selection` (`confirmingAllianceHelp`) walks the helpers one at a time — a same-device, pass-the-
    controller red bar (`scenes/board/controller-bar.ts`'s `drawAllianceHelpBar`, styled like the free-play
    confirm bar) naming the helper and the cards of theirs at stake, "Approve" advancing to the next helper (or
    dispatching once every helper has said yes) and "Decline" returning to `paying` with the same payment so the
    payer can choose different cards instead. Tests: `view/payment-model.test.ts`'s `allianceHelpersOf` describe
    block.
11. **Thor's "(in the order of your choice)"** (§3.22). `resolveAttackAgainst` resolves the extra targets in the order
    the ref lists them (play-area order), before the original target, which is one legal order; the player is not
    asked. The only thing the order can change is which overkill spill or defeat happens first. Proposed: keep it
    until a card makes the order matter; a choice step is an `orderCards`-style prompt on top of this effect.
12. **Spectrum's precon prints 43 cards, not 40** (card-data-pipeline, 2026-09-24). MC21 p. 3's own "Spectrum
    cards"/"Leadership cards"/"Basic cards" lists sum to 18 + 16 + 9 = 43, cross-checked 1:1 against MarvelCDB's
    names in order; no arithmetic error found in the transcription. Every other wave 4 precon is 40 (Vision's 41,
    §5.2, is the only other exception). Implemented as: the printed lists win, transcribed verbatim
    (`curation/mts.ts`'s own `starterDecks` note) — 43 is within RRG 1.8 p. 50's legal 40-50 range, and
    `validateDeck` accepts it, so nothing is broken by leaving it as printed rather than guessing which card the
    rulebook meant to drop. Needs a second source (the physical precon, once available) to confirm 43 is really
    what ships, not a rulebook transcription slip on FFG's own part.
13. **Six MarvelCDB records with no artwork anywhere** (§1, `PackCuration.artUnavailable`). Not a rules question —
    a data-availability one, flagged here because it's a standing gap rather than a decision either way: if a
    second-source scan of 21136b/21137b (Hela's Mystic-side backs) or 21182b/21184b/21186b/21189b (the four
    campaign-card backs) turns up later, prefer it (drop the matching `artUnavailable` entry, add an
    `imageOverrides` one instead) over leaving the acknowledged gap in place indefinitely.
14. **"If Valkyrie defeated that enemy"** (Death-Glow, §3.22) read as "her identity or an extension of it" (RRG 1.8
    "You, Your", p. 49): her attacks, events she played (Have at Thee!, a non-attack "deal damage" event), resources
    she spent (Audacity) and her upgrades count; allies do not. No ruling names Death-Glow; the RRG's extension rule is
    the reading.
15. **"When your hero defends against an attack"** (The Best Defense…, §3.22) is scripted on the basic defense's
    `basicPowerUsing` interrupt, which is the moment before the DEF is read. RRG 1.8 p. 15 lets it also trigger off a
    defense-labeled ability, but only a basic defense reduces damage at all, so there it would do nothing; the engine
    does not offer it there.
16. **A cancel ability aimed at a card that cannot be canceled** (§3.14). Nothing in RRG 1.8 "Cancel" or "'Cannot'"
    (p. 11) forbids initiating it; its costs are paid and it changes nothing. Implemented as: the cancel stays offered
    and fizzles. Proposed alternative for the user: withhold it from the legal actions (friendlier, but not a written
    rule). **USER DECISION 2026-09-24:** change it. A cancel whose only target cannot be canceled is not offered, so no
    cost is paid. Built generically in the legal-action layer (§3.27).
17. **Does a card that flips into a separately emitted face enter play?** (§3.10) RRG 1.8 "Flip" (p. 20) only says
    what stays on the card. But Defensive Protocols and Retrieve Odin's Armor (21184b, 21186b) print "Hinder 2", which
    only works on entering play, and a flipped-in side scheme at 0 threat could never be defeated; Black Swan's "After
    Black Swan engages you" needs an engagement. Implemented as: the new face is treated as entering play (starting
    threat plus hinder, engagement, "enters play" triggers). Needs a ruling or the MC21 insert's word. **USER
    DECISION 2026-09-24:** yes, it enters play (starting threat plus hinder, engagement, "enters play" triggers). Kept
    as implemented.
18. **Who pays Mister Fear's cost when another player's card readies the engaged player's hero?** (§3.19) The card
    says "for the engaged player to ready"; RRG 1.8 "Ready" (p. 36) says "for a player to ready a card, that player".
    Implemented as: the player readying pays — the controller at the end-of-phase ready, the resolving player for a
    card effect — and `player` scopes the rule to the engaged player, so another player's Cosmic Alliance readies the
    engaged player's hero without the cost. "A hero" is an identity in hero form; an alter-ego readies untaxed.
19. **"Nebula ignores … the crisis icon" on removal that is not her thwart** (§3.24). RRG 1.8 "Ignore" (p. 23) treats
    the icon as absent "while that ability is resolving", and a crisis icon blocks any player removal from the main
    scheme. Implemented as: the exemption covers the character's own thwarts (basic or "(thwart)", whose thwarting
    character she is) and removal sourced to the character itself; a non-thwart event she plays ("remove 2 threat
    from the main scheme") is still stopped. Proposed: keep; no card in the survey depends on the wider reading.
    **USER DECISION 2026-09-25:** keep. The exemption covers her own thwarts and removal she makes; a non-thwart event
    she plays is still blocked. No change.
20. **Does a player's attack still resolve if its attacker is defeated first?** (§3.21) Speed Demon's "(Resolve Speed
    Demon's attack first.)" can defeat the attacking ally before its own attack resolves. RRG 1.8 "Attack (Player
    Ability Type)" (p. 10) does not say; for an enemy, "Activation" (p. 6) ends an attack whose attacker leaves play.
    Implemented as (unchanged engine behavior): the attack still resolves, for the attacker's ATK as it last was.
    Proposed alternative: end a player attack whose attacker has left play, mirroring the enemy rule. Needs a ruling.
    **USER DECISION 2026-09-25:** change it. A player's attack whose attacker has left play ends: it deals no damage and
    its other attack results don't happen, mirroring the enemy rule (RRG 1.8 "Activation", p. 6). The user's pointer is
    a community ruling thread (BoardGameGeek, Mar 23, 2023), not an FFG ruling, so this is recorded as the user's
    decision. The same thread's contrasting case keeps working: a villain whose stage is defeated mid-attack and
    advances is the same character, still in play, so its attack continues with the new stage's ATK at damage time.
    **Implemented** generically in the engine (§3.21): `applyPlayerAttack` checks that the attacker is still in play
    before dealing damage, and logs `playerAttackEnded { attackerInstanceId, targetInstanceId, reason:
    "attackerLeftPlay" }` instead; no `characterAttacked` follows (so no retaliate or "after … attacks"). Damage still
    on the stack for a card no longer in play is not dealt at all (`applyDamage`, RRG 1.8 "In Play and Out of Play",
    p. 23), which is what stops the defeated ally's consequential damage from landing on it in the discard pile (before
    this, the discarded card was left with 1 damage on it). Effects printed after the attack in the same ability still
    resolve; no scripted card depends on that yet.
21. **A minion treated as an ally that stops being one** (§3.29): Mind Control discarded, Karma leaving play. No card
    or ruling says where the minion goes. Implemented as: it stays in the play area it is in and is engaged with the
    player who controlled it (a minion in a player's area is engaged with them, RRG 1.8 "Engaged", p. 18), without an
    engage event (nothing new engaged; it is "essentially a status change", ruling Dec 17, 2025 (1) #3). Proposed:
    keep. **USER DECISION 2026-09-25:** keep. The minion reverts to a minion in play where it is, engaged with the
    player who controlled it, with no new engage trigger. No change.
22. **Order of Loki's two defeat interrupts** (§3.48): All Hail King Loki 1B's advance and the defeated Loki's own When
    Defeated are simultaneous forced interrupts, which RRG 1.8 "Priority of Simultaneous Resolution" has the first
    player order. Implemented as: the advance resolves first and the defeated Loki's When Defeated right after, with
    no prompt. The order changes nothing a player can see (the side scheme is revealed either way, and the new Loki is
    in play when it is); asking is a later refinement if a card makes it matter. **Still open (2026-09-25):** the user
    has not decided this one; the default above (advance first, no prompt) stands.
23. **Does "Resolve each 'When Revealed' ability on each side scheme" include incite and surge?** (§3.56, Citywide
    Crisis.) RRG 1.8 calls each keyword "equivalent to the following triggered ability: 'When Revealed: …'" ("Incite X",
    p. 24; "Surge", p. 42); hinder is a constant ("enters play with X threat", p. 22) and is not included. Implemented as:
    yes, both, in a reveal's order (incite, the printed abilities, surge), each counting as one ability resolved for
    "If no 'When Revealed' ability was resolved this way". No ruling names Citywide Crisis. **USER DECISION
    2026-09-25:** change it. Citywide Crisis re-resolves only printed When Revealed abilities, not incite or surge: the
    user's reading is that incite and surge fire only when a card is revealed, and side schemes already in play are not
    being revealed. This is the user's decision against the letter of RRG 1.8's "equivalent to the following triggered
    ability: 'When Revealed: …'" ("Incite X", p. 24; "Surge", p. 42), recorded as such. "If no 'When Revealed' ability
    was resolved this way" counts printed abilities only, so a side scheme with only incite or surge leaves the
    fallback's 2 threat on each scheme in force. **Implemented** (§3.56): `resolveSpecials.includeKeywords`, default
    off, is how a future card that should include them opts in. **REVISED 2026-10-20 (owner), after the FFG ruling of
    September 22, 2026** (surge and incite count as When Revealed abilities and are ordered with the printed ones): a card
    that tells players to resolve another card's When Revealed abilities includes incite and surge (the default flips to
    on), with the players choosing the order; Change of Venue's boost keeps resolving only its non-surge When Revealed,
    a provisional exception pending FFG's announced erratum (spec §S7 E37 in docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md).
24. **Who breaks a tie for "the highest-cost card from your hand"?** (§3.55, Feisty Heist.) RRG 1.8 "First Player"
    (p. 19) gives the first player an encounter card's choice among "multiple eligible targets", but a hand is hidden
    information its owner holds. Implemented as: the player whose hand it is picks among the tied cards (the same in
    solo). Proposed: keep; needs a ruling to change. **USER DECISION 2026-09-25:** keep. The hand's owner breaks the
    tie. No change.
25. **Can an encounter effect that discards "an upgrade or support you control" choose one of Spectrum's facedown
    energy forms?** (§3.1; found 2026-09-26 in a browser campaign game, Caught Off Guard revealed against Spectrum in
    Ebony Maw.) Monica Rambeau's Setup puts Gamma, Photon and Pulsar "into play, facedown". A facedown form grants no
    form and has no title, text or keywords (§3.1), but nothing in RRG 1.8 or the rulings says whether it keeps its card
    type, so whether it is "an upgrade you control" is unanswered. Implemented as (unchanged): yes, the three facedown
    forms are eligible, and the first player picks among them (RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 19). Discarding one leaves
    Spectrum with two energy forms for the rest of the game. Proposed alternative: facedown forms are not eligible, so
    Caught Off Guard finds nothing and gains surge. Needs a ruling or a user decision. **USER DECISION 2026-09-26:**
    change it. Spectrum's and Vision's form upgrades are Permanent (RRG 1.8 "Permanent", p. 32: effects on cards not
    from this card's set cannot remove it from play), so they cannot leave play and are not affected, facedown or
    faceup. **Implemented:** `isPermanent` (`keywords.ts`) reads Permanent off the printed card as well as its current
    keywords, so neither facedown nor a blank removes it; every Permanent check uses it. Target validity
    (`resolve/target-validity.ts`, RRG 1.8 "Target", pp. 42–43) judges `discardFromPlay`: a card that cannot leave play
    is no valid target, so it is never offered. Caught Off Guard surges when its choice finds nothing
    (`choiceFoundNothing`). Tested in `packages/cards/src/wave4/permanent-forms.test.ts`.

## 5. What this asks of the other agents

- **`card-data-pipeline`** (after §1 lands):
  - ~~make `mts` survey clean and emit it, campaign cards included (§1.3, §1.6, §1.7, §1.10, §1.11, §1.13), with
    Spectrum and Adam Warlock precons from MC21 p. 3~~ — **done (2026-09-24)**, see §1's own status note;
  - ~~the form keyword (§1.1) and Vision's Dense face (§1.2), re-emitting `vision`~~ — done (273ac126);
  - ~~`modeOnly` (§1.8) and `classification` (§1.9), re-emitting `hood` and back-filling `gmw`'s split side
    schemes~~ — done (5f3a4b37);
  - ~~`hood`'s `Scenario` record (§1.12, §2.3)~~ — done (bd888fcc);
  - the four hero-pack precons from their inserts — still open; the Nebula/War Machine/Valkyrie/Vision inserts
    aren't in the repo (§2.1's own note), so sourcing them is a follow-up, not part of this pass.
- **`ability-scripting-engineer`:** the `mts` scenario builder must map `MultipleVillains.encounterDecks: "shared"` to
  `GameSetupConfig.sharedEncounterDeck` (§3.2) — the wave 1 builder (`wave1/setup.ts` `buildMultiVillain`) knows only
  per-villain decks. Script each pack once its §3 primitives are "landed"; §3.23 lists what composes today.
- **`rules-qa-engineer`:** a Tower Defense test where both villains reach 0 in one attack (§3.3); a Loki swap carrying
  attachments, status cards and the dial (§3.7); the campaign's full run, retry and permanent removal.
- **`game-client-engineer`:** the Standard II / Expert II setup toggles, `difficultySets` (§4 Q5); energy/mass form
  display and the form choice (§3.1); two main schemes and the Focused
  Defense marker (§3.2); damage on Avengers Tower (§3.5); the Infinity Stone deck and its discard pile (§3.6); Loki's
  set-aside versions and the victory count (§3.7); Odin on the main scheme (§3.8); an ally shown as a minion (§3.9);
  MC21's campaign-pool design pass (`docs/campaign-client-per-box.md` §3: Dossier and Briefing).
