## 2. Whole games (new)

Seeds are the first match of a deterministic search over 1..60, so a given run always finds the same game. Every game is
played from setup by the greedy driver, replayed with `replay(log)` and the final state compared with `toEqual`. The
second hero is Cyclops in Gambit's 2-player game and Gambit in Rogue's. No game is staged.

| Game                    | Variants                                         | What the game must contain (asserted from the replayed events)                                                                          | Staged? |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Gambit vs Rhino         | 2 players standard (with Cyclops), 1 hero expert | Charge de Card and Throw de Card both resolved, and a `charge` counter added                                                            | No      |
| Gambit vs Rhino, Exodus | 2 players standard (with Cyclops)                | Any ability of the set resolved (`3703[2-5]`: Exodus's When Revealed, Herald of Avalon, Psionic Shield or Acolyte Frenzy)               | No      |
| Rogue vs Rhino          | 2 players standard (with Gambit), 1 hero expert  | Skin Contact and Rogue's player phase Forced Response (Touched found and set aside) both resolved                                       | No      |
| Rogue vs Rhino, Reavers | 2 players standard (with Gambit)                 | Any ability of the set resolved (`38029` to `38035`: a Reaver's Forced Response or When Revealed, The Reavers, Cybernetic Enhancements) | No      |

The greedy driver reaches every signature mechanic unaided (Throw de Card and Skin Contact are `useAbility` / trigger
choices it makes), so none of the games needed surgery. No game wins (the greedy driver ends in a loss, as in the other
passes); an outcome is only required to exist. The older `e2e.test.ts` files already played each pack's solo, 2-player
(with Wolverine) and Core-hero modular games.

## 3. Findings

**Bug, pinned with `it.fails` (owner: `game-rules-architect`): a piercing attack that Bulletproof Belle prevents does not
discard the tough status card Belle gave.**

- Ruling Jan 17, 2026 (3) #1 (Alex Werner): "Effects that 'prevent damage' prevent damage taken, not dealt. If Rogue plays
  Bulletproof Belle and gains a Tough status card, an attack with Piercing that still deals damage to her will remove
  that Tough status card." RRG "Piercing" (p. 32) exempts only an attack that "would deal no damage".
- Repro (`rogue/qa.test.ts`, "Senyaka's piercing attack discards the tough card Belle just gave", `it.fails`): Rogue in
  hero form, Senyaka (32161, a minion whose attacks gain piercing) engaged, Touched put on him with Skin Contact, the
  villain stunned, Bulletproof Belle in hand; end the turn and play Belle when Senyaka attacks. Actual: `statusGiven
  tough`, `attackResolved { baseAtk: 3, damageDealt: 3 }`, `damagePrevented { amount: 3, reason: "effect" }`, and no
  `statusRemoved`; Rogue keeps the tough card (the next treachery's damage then uses it). Expected: a `statusRemoved
  tough` between the prevention and the end of the attack.
- Cause: `packages/engine/src/resolve/event.ts` (~line 877 to 915), the `preventedByAttackFlag` and `damagePreventerOf`
  branches return before `pierceTough` runs; the code's own comment calls this an "UNCONFIRMED READING" and says no cycle
  1 card reaches it. Belle is the first card that does, and the ruling settles it. The same ruling's #2 (keywords have
  timing priority over triggered abilities, Aerial Evacuation) is the same fix and is not a card of these packs.
- The companion test (`Senyaka's piercing attack deals damage that Belle prevents: Rogue takes none`) passes today and
  must keep passing after the fix. When the fix lands, delete the `it.fails` wrapper.

**Flagged conflict, owner-decided, not a bug report: Teamwork resolves before When Revealed (Q2) against RRG 1.8 p. 43.**
RRG p. 43 ("Teamwork (Trait)"): "If a minion with the teamwork keyword is being revealed, the teamwork keyword resolves
after any 'When Revealed' abilities on that minion are resolved." The owner chose the opposite for Q2 (docs section 4.1:
before, "like quickstrike", by ruling Feb 28, 2026 (4) #2), and `reavers/index.test.ts` pins that order. The ruling names
Quickstrike only and is dated before RRG 1.8 (July 2026), which restates the teamwork order in the same entry. The Reavers
make the difference visible: Wade Cole and Murray Reese reveal with a When Revealed that attaches Cybernetic Enhancements
(+1 ATK, cannot take damage, discarded after the minion attacks). With the RRG order a teamwork attack by Wade has ATK 3 and
spends the attachment; with Q2's order it has ATK 2 and the attachment survives until his next attack. Not changed here;
taken to the user as a decision to confirm against the RRG text.

Open questions, no authoritative source found, so nothing is pinned (said plainly):

- **Psionic Shield and "defeated".** Exodus is at 0 hit points, the Shield heals him and he never leaves play. Whether
  Stealth Strike's "if that enemy is defeated by this attack" (37014), War Room's "after an ally ... defeats a minion"
  (37030) and Overkill's excess (RRG p. 31) see that as a defeat has no ruling. The erratum text ("would leave play, instead
  heal") suggests the character is defeated and the defeat is replaced, but nothing says so. Untested.
- **Bulletproof Belle on an attack against another player.** Its text has no "you" ("When an enemy with Touched attached to
  it attacks"), so by ruling Dec 17, 2025 (3) it is not limited to attacks on Rogue; what "prevent all damage from that
  attack" and the defense label then do for a hero who is not the target is unspecified. Untested (the second player's attack
  was not probed with a second Belle).
- **Natural Agility against a tough status card.** The test uses FAQ p. 56 and RRG p. 44 by analogy: the +DEF is made in the
  "when you defend" window, so it is part of the DEF the defense applies, not an interrupt that reduces damage afterwards.
  If FFG rules the other way (the interrupt is too late and the card must be spent), the "with 1 counter held" test is the one
  to change.

Not checked (thin coverage, said plainly):

- A card-by-card audit of the two packs against their scans: the module tests cover each card, this pass read only the cards
  that rulings, errata and interactions name.
- Med Lab (38028) and Misled (38027's stay-in-hand outside a Mystique game) are known and being fixed; no test here depends on
  them. Bishop's all-counters interrupt is now scripted and its module tests pass.
- Thief Extraordinaire, The Thieves Guild, Operative Skill, Dazzler, Iceman, Karma, Judoka Skill, Moira MacTaggert, X-Gene,
  Mutant Education, X-Men Instruction and the Guild Business obligation have no ruling or FAQ entry, so no QA test cites one;
  their behavior is covered only by the module tests.
- The Reavers' Skullbuster, Murray Reese and The Reavers side scheme and the Exodus set's Herald of Avalon and Acolyte Frenzy
  likewise have only module tests (and the games above, which only prove that some card of the set resolved).

## 4. Test record

- `cd packages/cards && pnpm exec vitest run src/wave6/gambit/qa.test.ts src/wave6/rogue/qa.test.ts`: 31 passed and 1
  expected fail (15 Gambit; 16 Rogue plus the `it.fails` pin), about 50 s while other agents were running.
- `pnpm --filter @mc/cards exec tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit`, `pnpm exec oxlint` and `pnpm exec oxfmt --check` on both files:
  clean.
