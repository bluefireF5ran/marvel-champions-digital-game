# Phase 7 wave 6 rules-QA pass: Mutant Genesis scenarios (`mut_gen`)

`rules-qa-engineer`, 2026-10-03. Scope: the box's five scenarios (Sabretooth, Project Wideawake, Master Mold, Mansion
Attack, Magneto) and their modular sets (Brotherhood, Acolytes, Mystique, Sentinels, Zero Tolerance, Future Past) against
RRG 1.8 (FAQ pp. 62 to 64, errata pp. 67 to 68), the MC32 rulebook and the post-1.7 rulings. Not the heroes (Colossus,
Shadowcat) or the campaign: later passes. Test file: `packages/cards/src/wave6/mut_gen/qa.test.ts`; no non-test code
was touched.

## 2. Whole games (new)

Seeds are the first match of a deterministic search over 1..60, so a given run always finds the same game. Every game is
played from setup by the greedy driver, replayed with `replay(log)` and the final state compared with `toEqual`.
Heroes are wave 6 precons (`cyclops-leadership`, `phoenix-justice`, `wolverine-aggression`, `storm-leadership`).

Staging, said plainly: in 60 seeds the greedy driver never defeated Find the Senator in the solo expert Sabretooth game
(it did in the 2-player game, unaided), and never defeated Abduction Protocols in either Wideawake variant (each seed takes
3 to 5 s, a 60-seed search about 3 minutes). Those games are staged by surgery: Abduction Protocols / Find the Senator is
set to 1 threat, then P1 changes to hero form and thwarts it through `sessionApply` (so the prefix log replays), then the
driver plays to an outcome. Two logs, each replayed deep-equal: the prefix equals the state handed to `playToOutcome`, and
that run's log equals its final state. The signature is asserted on the prefix's events and state. Nothing in the other
games is staged. No game wins (the greedy driver ends in a loss, as in the other passes); an outcome is only required
to exist. The older `*-e2e.test.ts` files already play each scenario with a Core hero.

## 3. Findings

### Bug: a boost card that gives "the villain" an extra boost card gives it to the activating minion (fixed in 05563d10)

- **Fixed in 05563d10:** the four boosts read the new `activatingEnemy` ref (the enemy of the innermost `enemyAttack` /
  `enemyScheme` frame, `packages/engine/src/activating-enemy.test.ts`):
  `boost(ifThen(refMatches(activatingEnemy, query("villain", { name })), modifyAttack({ extraBoostCards: 1 })))`. The
  `qa.test.ts` pin is a plain `it`; `mansion-attack-cards.test.ts` adds the scheming and Bastion cases per title.

- **Expected** (Ruling Feb 28, 2026 (6), Alex Werner: a villainous minion draws Pirate Lackey, which gives the villain a
  boost card; "No. Because the villain is not activating, do not give it a boost card."): the Brotherhood treacheries'
  "[star] Boost: If the villain is Avalanche, give him an additional boost card for this activation" does nothing
  when a minion, not the villain, is activating. Only the villain and villainous minions are dealt boost cards (RRG "Attack (Enemy Activation)" p. 9, "Boost" p. 11).
- **Actual:** the extra card goes to the minion whose activation is in progress.
- **Repro** (`qa.test.ts`, "Avalanche is the villain, Bastion (villainous) activates with Ground Swell as his boost
  card"): `mansionAttackGame({ villain: "Avalanche", modularSetIds: ["future_past"] })`, hero form, Bastion (32167, villainous)
  engaged by surgery, encounter deck stacked `01186`, `32132` (Ground Swell), `32136`; P1 ends the turn. `boostCardDealt`:
  villain 1 (correct), Bastion 2 (should be 1).
- **Cause:** `extraBoostIfVillain` in `mansion-attack.ts` is `boost(ifThen(exists(villain named X), modifyAttack({ extraBoostCards: 1 })))`;
  `modifyAttack` applies to the activation in progress whoever is activating.
- **Caveat on the authority:** the ruling names Pirate Lackey and a villainous minion, not these cards; the application is by
  analogy (same wording shape: "give the villain an additional boost card" while the villain is not the one activating).
  Whether the extra card should go to the minion instead (the card says "for this activation") is not answered by the ruling;
  it is a rules question for the owner if the analogy is not accepted. The four cards are Mansion Attack's, so the case is
  reachable in a real game (Fabian Cortez and Bastion are the villainous minions of the sets).
- **Owner:** `ability-scripting-engineer` (the four `*.boost` scripts) with `game-rules-architect` if `modifyAttack` should
  refuse an extra card for an activation whose enemy is not the named one.

### Known, not re-reported

- Robert Kelly attached to a scheme is in no play area, so lethal damage never defeats him (pinned `it.fails` in
  `sabretooth.test.ts`, the handoff's engine note). The staged and unaided Sabretooth games here do not depend on it.
- Find the Senator's crisis icon blocks main-scheme thwarts by design (handoff).
- The "take damage" cost bug (RRG p. 14) was handled in the MojoMania pass.

### Flagged conflict, resolved by the RRG

Ruling Jan 26, 2026 (3) and RRG 1.8 "Overkill" (p. 31) disagree about excess damage "dealt" when damage is capped or
reduced; the RRG's later revision wins (user decision 2026-09-25, `engine/src/excess-equals-overkill.test.ts`). The new Nimrod
test pins the RRG reading with the real cards.

### Not checked (thin coverage, said plainly)

- A card-by-card audit of the five scenario sets against their scans: the module tests cover each card; this pass read only
  the cards that rulings, errata, the rulebook and interactions name.
- Mansion Attack's four villains in sequence (Save the School's win and advance, victory by difficulty) are covered by
  `mansion-attack.test.ts`; the greedy driver never defeats a villain, so no whole game plays a second villain.
- Magneto's later stages (defeating a stage by the driver) and Boarding Party / Sabotage Master Mold being defeated happen in
  the games only incidentally; their text is in `magneto.test.ts`.
- FFG's Feb 28 (6) analogy (see above); Fabian Cortez's ruling is the only Acolytes ruling, the other Acolytes minions have none.
- Future Past in its campaign deck form (a separate scenario deck) is a later campaign pass; here it plays as a modular set.

## 4. Test record

- `cd packages/cards && pnpm exec vitest run src/wave6/mut_gen/qa.test.ts`: 23 passed, 1 expected fail (the pinned bug), 24 tests,
  about 90 s.
- `pnpm exec oxlint` and `pnpm exec oxfmt --check` on the test file and `pnpm --filter @mc/cards exec tsc -p tsconfig.json
  --noEmit` for the file: clean.
