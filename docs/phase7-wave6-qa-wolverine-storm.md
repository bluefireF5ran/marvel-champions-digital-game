| Ruling Jun 2, 2026 (1): Jubilee's lasting effect targets the chosen enemy, not card instances; stacks per trigger; Cameo / ally versions work the same                  | Jubilee                                         | Stacking already: `support-upgrades-allies.test.ts` "each trigger stacks".

## 2. Whole games (new)

Seeds are the first match of a deterministic search over 1..60, so a given run always finds the same game. Every game
is played from setup by the greedy driver, replayed with `replay(log)` and the final state compared with `toEqual`.
The second hero is Storm in Wolverine's 2-player game and Cyclops in Storm's.

| Game                                      | Variants                                         | What the game must contain (asserted from the replayed events)                                                                                            | Staged? |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Wolverine vs Rhino, healing and berserker | 2 players standard (with Storm), 1 hero expert   | Healing Factor resolved (`35001a.wolverine-constant`, a `damageHealed` event) and Berserker Barrage resolved (`35008.berserker-barrage-action`)           | No      |
| Wolverine vs Rhino, the Claws             | 2 players standard (with Storm), 1 hero expert   | The Claws action resolved, playing Lunging Strike, the Claws exhausted, the event in the discard pile; then the driver plays to an outcome                | Yes     |
| Wolverine vs Rhino, Lady Deathstrike      | 2 players standard (with Storm), 1 hero expert   | Any ability of the set resolved (`3503[4-7]`: Lady Deathstrike's response, Seeking Vengeance, Adamantium Upgrades or Hack 'n' Slash)                      | No      |
| Storm vs Rhino, Weather                   | 2 players standard (with Cyclops), 1 hero expert | "I feel a storm coming..." resolved, a `cardsSwapped` (`leftAndEntered`) from Weather Control or Weather Goddess, and a Weather Special resolved after it | No      |
| Storm vs Rhino, The Shadow King           | 2 players standard (with Cyclops), 1 hero expert | Any ability of the set resolved (`3603[6-9]`: The Shadow King, Ruler of the Astral Plane, Possessed or Astral Attack)                                     | No      |

Staging, said plainly: the greedy driver never uses Wolverine's Claws (across seeds 1..6 in four variants the action never
resolved; its cost chooses an event from hand, which the driver may not generate), so that game is staged. Surgery: Lunging Strike is moved into hand, then the Claws are used through
`sessionApply` (so the prefix's log replays), a chain of two logs, each replayed deep-equal: the prefix equals the state
handed to `playToOutcome`, and that run's log equals its final state. Weather Control, Weather Goddess, Healing Factor and
Berserker Barrage are all reached by the driver unaided. No game wins (the greedy driver ends in a loss, as in the other
passes); an outcome is only required to exist. The older `e2e.test.ts` files already played each pack's solo, 2-player
and expert games.

## 3. Findings

No bug found in this pass. No `it.fails` was needed. The known "take damage" cost bug (RRG p. 14; `mojo/qa.test.ts`)
was not re-reported and was committed as fixed (3d004785) while this pass ran; the tests here do not depend on it.

**Decided: Q81, repeat only if all 2 taken (3bc5b946).** Berserker Barrage's repeat when the 2 damage is
prevented: with a tough status card (or a reduction) Wolverine takes less than 2 and the ability no longer repeats
(owner decision 2026-10-03; tests in `wolverine/events.test.ts`).

Not checked (thin coverage, said plainly):

- A card-by-card audit of the two packs against their scans: the module tests cover each card, this pass read only the
  cards that rulings, errata and interactions name.
- The Unflappable FAQ is about a Boost ability's damage against an "undefended" cost, not about Frenzy; it is used as the
  nearest FFG statement that a second source of damage during an attack is not the attack's damage. If FFG rules the
  other way for forced interrupts, the Omega Red test is the one to change.
- Pixie against Magik (FAQ p. 64) and the Aug 3 ruling's Odin as a real Hela game: Magik is not scripted, and wave 6's
  scenario builder cannot seat Hela, so Odin is seated by surgery from a patched card.
- Q26's edges for the Weather deck (a card that would go to a discard pile, hand or deck returns facedown) are pinned at
  engine level (`packages/engine/src/separate-deck-no-discard.test.ts`), not re-tested through card scripts here.
- Gentle, Mirage, Havok, Hangar Bay, Leadership Skill, Forge, Switchblade, Knife Fight and Callisto have no ruling or FAQ
  entry, so no QA test cites one; their behavior is covered only by the module tests.

## 4. Test record

- `cd packages/cards && pnpm exec vitest run src/wave6/wolv/qa.test.ts src/wave6/storm/qa.test.ts`: 32 passed (19
  Wolverine, 13 Storm), about 15 s.
