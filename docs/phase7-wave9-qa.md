# Phase 7 wave 9 rules-QA pass

`rules-qa-engineer`, 2026-10-10, branch `feature/wave-9`. Definition of done step 4 ("Rules QA", `docs/wave-definition-of-done.md`):
each pack audited against its card text, RRG 1.8 (`docs/rules/mc_rulesreference_v18_compressed.pdf`) and the FFG rulings
(`docs/rulings/marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md`). Owner answers are `docs/phase7-wave9.md` section 4.1 and are not reopened here. No script,
engine or data file was changed; findings are reported for the owning specialist.

## Black Panther (bp)

Scope: 51001a/b to 51042 (scripts in `packages/cards/src/wave9/bp/`, data in `packages/content/src/data/bp/cards.ts`). Every script was read
against the printed text in the data. Regression tests: `packages/cards/src/wave9/bp/rulings.qa.test.ts` (16 tests, 1 of them `it.fails`
pinning the findings below, each with a companion test that pins today's behavior). The module tests are thorough (about 320 cases); this file
holds only interactions they do not assert.

### Findings

| Card id                    | Expected (source)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Actual                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Severity   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 51025 Heart of the Panther | "Resolve the Special on up to 4 Black Panther upgrades": at least 1 must be chosen when one can resolve (owner decision wave 3 Q16, `docs/phase7-wave3.md` section 4; restated in `docs/phase7-wave9.md` 3.36). No printed "may".                                                                                                                      | Was `chooseCards(min 0, max 4)`. **Fixed**: the script now takes 1 to 4, and `aspect-basic.test.ts` asserts it.                                                                                                                                                 | Low, fixed |
| 51018 The Raft             | Printed "tuck it under here from the encounter discard pile" is before the cost arrow, so it is a cost; a cost that cannot be paid cannot be initiated (RRG 1.8 "Cost"). A minion with Victory (Joystick 51039) that leaves play goes to the victory display (RRG "Victory X"), not the encounter discard pile, so the response should not be offered. | The response is offered for any minion that leaves play and then does nothing (nothing tucked, no threat removed, no deal). Already documented in the script's header as a known deviation (no tuck cost exists in the engine); recorded here so it is tracked. | Low        |

The Raft is pinned: `it.fails` for the expected behavior and a passing test for today's. When it is fixed, flip the `it.fails` to `it` and
delete its companion.

### Checked, no findings

- **Stun and Confuse against labeled abilities (RRG "Labeled Ability", "Stun, Stunned", "Confuse, Confused"; ruling Aug 13, 2026 (1)).** A stunned
  hero playing Clawed Strike 51003 loses the whole ability (no 4 damage, no Special), the stun card is discarded and the event is still played;
  a confused hero playing On the Prowl 51004 likewise. Wakanda Forever! 51005 with a stunned hero: Panther Claws' (attack) Special is canceled
  and uses up the stun while Kimoyo Beads' (thwart) Special still resolves. A stunned White Wolf 51037 attack is "not considered to have
  attacked", so his Forced Response places no threat.
- **T'Challa's Shadow 51031.** At the last doubt counter the card is discarded to the victory display (RRG "Uses", "Victory X"), not the discard
  pile, and its +1 cost ends. A (thwart) event counts as "you thwart" and removes a counter (RRG "Labeled Ability"); a stunned hero's replaced
  basic attack does not. (Existing tests cover basic thwart, attack, defense, and that an ally's attack is not "you".)
- **Spider Bites 51012** choosing the other player in a two-player game: the villain and only that player's minion take 1 and are stunned; the
  first player's own minion is untouched.
- **Vibranium Suit 51013** on a hero that already has a tough status card: the hero keeps one, per RRG "Status Cards" ("cannot have more than one
  status card of each type"). Note the RRG's own "Tough" entry has a bullet about "multiple tough status cards"; it grants nothing, so the
  engine's single-card cap is right, but the two entries read oddly together (not a conflict with any ruling).
- **Queen Ramonda 51008**: another player's T'Challa in hero form is not an alter-ego and is not healed.
- **Target Spotter 51038 with Quickstrike (RRG "Activation", "Quickstrike"; FAQ "Target Spotter (#38)", RRG p. 65).** A Quickstrike minion (Vulture)
  dealt to another player and Spotted onto the Spotter's player engages them and does not attack (a Quickstrike attack is an activation, and
  "cannot activate" holds until the end of the phase).
- **The Scream 51035 as a boost card** when an ally defends: "you are stunned" is the player's identity; the defending ally is not stunned.
- **Extreme Risk 51042 as a boost card on a scheme activation** (Shuri in alter-ego form): the extra boost card is dealt and flipped and its
  icons count (SCH 1 + 2 + 1).

### Read against the card text, not covered by a new test

Script reads correct against the printed text, and the module tests assert them: the Inventor search and reduction (51001b, owner Q15: the
search is compulsory), Black Panther and T'Challa responses (a Special resolved this way is not a basic power, so no chain), Panther Claws'
single instance of 5 with piercing, Kimoyo Beads, the Elephant's Trunk (FAQ p. 65), Aja-Adanna, Manifold, Infiltration, Going Undercover,
Show of Empathy and Redemption, Invisibility Gear, Sting Operation, the Dora Milaje allies and support, White Wolf, Build Support and Sonic
Rifle (aliases of earlier scripts), Klaw, the two M.U.S.I.C. cards, Joystick, Energy Truncheon and Playing for Keeps.

### Thin coverage and open points

- **Cost-modifier order, unverified.** Shuri's Inventor "reduce its resource cost by 2" together with T'Challa's Shadow's "+1 to each card you
  play" on a card whose printed cost is 1 (Invisibility Gear) gives 0 or 1 depending on whether the reduction is applied before the increase.
  RRG 1.8 "Cost" and "Ignore" and the rulings file give no order, so no test was written; ask the owner or FFG before pinning it.
- **Klaw and Playing for Keeps together** (Klaw gets one boost card from his own Forced Interrupt and one from Playing for Keeps; text says "in
  addition to any other boost cards"): each is tested alone, the pair is not.
- **Energy Truncheon's Hero Action under Invisibility Gear** (the attack becomes a scheme: is "after this attack, discard this card" met?): no
  ruling found, not tested.
- **Quickstrike on a minion Infiltration 51015 puts into play** is owner question 25 (it attacks); not re-tested here.
- No FFG ruling in the file names a bp card or Special-based mechanic, and no conflict between the RRG and a ruling was found for this pack.

## Silk (silk)

Scope: 52001a/b to 52038 (scripts in `packages/cards/src/wave9/silk/`, data in `packages/content/src/data/silk/cards.ts`). Every script was read
against the printed text in the data. Regression tests: `packages/cards/src/wave9/silk/rulings.qa.test.ts` (15 tests, none of them `it.fails`).
The module tests are thorough (about 400 cases, including the Q7 cases for Cindy Moon, Swinging Silk Kick, Wallcrawl and the four-card cap);
this file holds only interactions they do not assert.

### Findings

None. Every case written against an RRG entry, a ruling or an owner decision passed on the first run after the test setup was right (three
early failures were mistakes in the test staging, not in the game: a filler card that was in Rhino's set, a defeat staged out of turn, and a
picker that named the same card for two different prompts).

### Checked, no findings

- **Stun and Confuse against labeled events and basic-power upgrades (RRG "Labeled Ability", "Stun, Stunned", "Confuse, Confused"; ruling
  Aug 13, 2026 (1)).** A stunned hero playing Swinging Silk Kick 52003 loses the whole ability: no damage, and the optional discard of a tucked
  card is not made (it is part of the effect, not a cost), while the event is still played. A confused hero playing Wallcrawl 52004 removes
  neither the 2 nor the 3 threat and keeps the tucked card. A stunned hero's basic attack and a confused hero's basic thwart are replaced by
  discarding the status card, so Spider Claws 52011 and Outwit 52010 are not offered and stay ready ("not considered to have attacked").
- **Silk Sense 52001a through events and Overkill.** Swinging Silk Kick with a matching tucked card defeats Sandman (4 hit points) with 9
  damage: the 5 excess damage goes to Rhino (RRG "Overkill") and Silk Sense is offered for the defeat and tucks Sandman. Wallcrawl removing the
  last threat from a side scheme is Silk's defeat, and the response is offered.
- **Response timing inside an event (RRG "Initiating Abilities" step 7; FAQ "Tigra (#51)").** Silk Sense is offered immediately after the
  side scheme is defeated by Wallcrawl's first sentence, before its second sentence resolves, so the side scheme just tucked is a legal card
  to discard for the 3 additional threat when it shares an encounter set with the chosen scheme. This follows the FAQ's "immediately after"
  reading; recorded here because it is a surprising consequence for a player.
- **Silk Sense and another player.** In a two-player game, the other player's basic attack that defeats a minion does not offer Silk Sense
  to the Silk player, and nothing is tucked.
- **Silk Sense on a treachery that tucks itself.** Hunting the Spider-Bride 52031 revealed with Silk Sense accepted: the card is tucked once
  (by its own When Revealed), is not in the encounter discard pile, and is not tucked a second time.
- **Eidetic Memory 52008 (erratum, RRG p. 70).** A boost card of the tucked card's encounter set is flipped, not revealed, so the interrupt
  is not offered (control: the same card dealt to Silk is offered). In a two-player game a card the other player reveals does not open
  Silk's interrupt ("when you reveal"). Ruling April 30, 2026, Ruling 3 (3) (flipping an environment is not a reveal) is a scenario case
  (Wheel of Genres, Alert Level) outside this pack's fixtures; `docs/phase7-wave9.md` section 3.16 already carries it.
- **Spider Reflexes 52012 under Silk Sense Overload 52028.** The after-the-attack tuck is a player card's (an upgrade), so the encounter
  card goes under the obligation, and nothing goes under Silk. The module tests cover Albert Moon, Smooth as Silk, Get the Scoop and an
  encounter card's own tuck.
- **Organic Webbing 52009 discarding a Hunting the Spider-Bride (owner decision Q7 = A).** The discard is a cost of a player card's
  ability, so the 2 damage is dealt to Silk, the Bride goes to the encounter discard pile and Webbing is exhausted. The module tests cover the
  same for Cindy Moon's action.
- **"Stop Hitting Yourself" 52016 with a tough status card (RRG "Tough").** Silk defending an attack that would deal 1 damage after her DEF
  and absorbing it with a tough status card "is not considered to have taken damage", so the response is offered (control: with 1 damage
  taken it is not).
- **Wallcrawl 52004 and the crisis icon (RRG "Crisis Icon").** With Crowd Control (crisis) in play, the 2 threat comes off Crowd Control but
  the 3 aimed at the main scheme is not removed.

### Read against the card text, not covered by a new test

Script reads correct against the printed text, and the module tests assert them: both faces of the four-card cap (a state check, the
controller picks the four that stay), Cindy Moon's discard cost and once-per-round limit, Smooth as Silk (until-discard, empty deck fulfills
the effect, RRG "Encounter Deck"), Get the Scoop (any player, `triggerableBy`, the Cindy Moon player tucks), Albert Moon, J. Jonah Jameson,
the Outwit/Spider Claws counts by encounter set with piercing, Spider Reflexes' DEF, Morlun's constant and When Defeated, The Great Hunt,
Silk Sense Overload's redirect and "then", Hunting the Spider-Bride (Q7), the Growing Strong set (Atlas, Grow Invulnerable, Growing Strong,
Titanic Proportions) and the basic cards (reprints of Rogue's Not Today!, Spider-Man 27049 and Across the Spider-Verse 27018 are aliases of
those scripts; Quick Quip is the wave 5 script).

### Thin coverage and open points

- **Stunned or confused Atlas against Growing Strong 52037.** The text gains surge "if no enemy activated this way", and RRG "Stun, Stunned"
  says a stunned enemy "is not considered to have attacked" (RRG "Activation": attacking or scheming is activating), so a stunned Atlas
  should leave surge in place. Not tested: an Atlas already in play activates in the villain phase's step 2 and spends the stun before the
  encounter card is revealed, and the harness has no way to stop between steps. Needs a stepwise driver or a reveal outside the villain phase.
- **Wallcrawl when the removal is prevented.** With the 3 threat prevented by a crisis icon, the tucked card is still discarded (the
  discard is "may ... to remove"). No ruling found; not pinned.
- **Albert Moon's heal option with nothing tucked** (heals 0): no ruling on offering an option that does nothing; not tested.
- **Eliminated player.** RRG "Elimination" moves an eliminated player's minions with their tucked cards; what happens to cards tucked under
  an eliminated identity (an identity that leaves play discards them, RRG "Tuck") is not tested, nor is the Spider-Bride's "that identity
  takes 2 damage" for it.
- No FFG ruling in the file names a silk card except Ruling April 30, 2026, Ruling 3 (3) (Eidetic Memory) and Ruling December 17, 2025,
  Ruling 2 ("Stop Hitting Yourself"'s DEF), both already asserted by the module tests; no conflict between the RRG and a ruling was found
  for this pack. The RRG's own wording on responses ("may be resolved after the specified triggering condition occurs") and on step 7 of
  "Initiating Abilities" agree with the FAQ's Tigra answer.

## Winter Soldier (winter)

Scope: 54001a/b to 54033 (scripts in `packages/cards/src/wave9/winter/`: the hero's identity, events, support-upgrades-allies and
obligation-nemesis modules and `aspect-basic.ts`; data in `packages/content/src/data/winter/cards.ts`). Whiteout, Blizzard 54034, Encased in Ice
54035 and Slippery Conditions 54036 are not scripted yet and were not audited. Every script was read against the printed text in the data.
Regression tests: `packages/cards/src/wave9/winter/rulings.qa.test.ts` (25 tests, none of them `it.fails`). The module tests are thorough
(about 350 cases, including the owner's Q21 Firepower cases and the Arm Block cases for ruling January 17, 2026 - Ruling 2); this file holds
only interactions they do not assert.

### Findings

None. Every case written against an RRG entry, a ruling or an owner decision passed once the test staging was right (the early failures were
mistakes in the staging, not in the game: a main scheme at 0 threat when Lethal Protector removes 2, a second player thwarting out of turn and
in alter-ego form, and a stunned Rhino that is dealt no boost card, so the stacked "Assault" was dealt to the player and attacked).
One case is an open rules point rather than a finding (see below).

### Checked, no findings

- **A stunned hero and Winter Soldier's attack events (RRG "Labeled Ability" p. 26, "Stun, Stunned" p. 41; ruling August 13, 2026 - Ruling 1
  (1)).** Metal Punch 54005 paid with Cybernetic Arm, Electrical Discharge 54006, Super-Soldiers 54022 and Firepower 54014 (Sidearm exhausted
  as its cost) are all played, their costs paid (the Arm and the Weapon end exhausted), and the whole ability is canceled: no damage, no stun
  on the enemy, no tough cards for Captain America and Winter Soldier, and the stun card is removed.
- **Arm Block 54004 (attack/defense) with status cards.** A stunned hero: the whole ability is canceled, so there is no 3 damage and no
  defense, and the hero takes Rhino's 2 damage ("the entire ability ... is canceled", "each status card ... that cancels any of the labeled
  ability's types is removed"). A confused hero: confuse cancels only a thwart, so Arm Block deals 3, defends, and the confused card stays.
  A stunned Rhino makes no attack ("not considered to have attacked"), so "When an enemy attacks" never happens and Arm Block is not offered.
- **Winter Armor 54009 and Steady (RRG "Steady" p. 41).** One stunned status card on the armored hero does not resolve: the basic attack is made
  and the card stays. Two do resolve: the attack is replaced and both are removed.
- **One basic attack with Winter Rifle 54011, Bambino 54018 and the defeat responses (RRG "Piercing" p. 32, "Overkill" p. 31, "Tough" p. 44,
  "Restricted" p. 38; ruling January 17, 2026 - Ruling 3 (2); ruling March 6, 2026 - Ruling 1 (2)).** On a tough Shocker the Rifle's piercing
  discards the tough card first, so ATK 4 + 3 = 7 defeats it and 4 spill to Rhino through Bambino's overkill; Lethal Protector then removes
  2 threat; two restricted cards stay within the limit. Bambino alone against the tough card: all damage is prevented, nothing spills, and the
  ammo counter is still spent. Lethal Protector, Winter Mask and Silent Infiltration all answer one defeat: threat 2 removed, 1 card drawn,
  the hero readied, an enemy confused.
- **Cybernetic Arm 54002 with the events it pays for (RRG "Event" p. 19; owner answer Q53; "Wild Resource").** One by One 54015 paid with
  the Arm: both instances of damage are +1 (3 to the Shocker, then 3 to the villain). Electrical Discharge paid with the Arm's wild resource
  and a [mental] card stuns (the wild counts as [energy]) and deals 4 + 1. Metal Punch with the Arm against a tough Shocker: prevented in
  full, no overkill excess reaches Rhino.
- **Team-Up with another player's character (RRG "Team-Up" p. 43).** In a two-player game Super-Soldiers is playable with the other
  player's Captain America in play ("a friendly character in play"), and he receives the tough status card.
- **Safe House #30 54007 finding Crossbones (RRG "Quickstrike" p. 36, "Engage" p. 18).** In alter-ego form the Quickstrike minion engages
  Bucky Barnes and does not attack (Quickstrike needs a player in hero form); the "then" card is drawn.
- **Crossbones 54028 and Hydra Hit Squad 54029 (RRG "Hit Points" p. 22, "Tough" p. 44).** The side scheme's +1 ATK makes his attack (3) defeat
  a full-health Black Widow and the Forced Response places 2 threat (without it she survives with 2 damage). A tough Captain America hit for
  3 is not defeated and the response does not trigger (control: without tough, it does). When the side scheme is defeated the +2 hit points
  end and a Hydra minion with 4 damage is defeated at once (Hit Points: a "+X hit points" that ceases to be in effect). In a two-player game
  the player who thwarts it gets the found Hydra minion engaged with them.
- **High-Tech Armament 54030's Hero Action cost.** With the identity exhausted and no other character the action is refused; with a ready
  ally, the ally is exhausted to pay it and the card is discarded.
- **Man on the Wall 54019.** A reduction not used in the hero phase is gone the next round: Winter Rifle (cost 3) paid with 2 cards is
  refused, and accepted with 3.
- **Spoiling for a Fight 54016 with no minion (RRG "Encounter Deck" p. 17).** The discard runs out the deck and is "considered to be
  fulfilled": no minion enters play and the hero is still readied. The module comment's "everything before the arrow is a cost" does not make
  the event unplayable here, and the RRG sentence says it should not.

### Open point (pinned, not an `it.fails`)

- **54023 Winter, Widow, Soldier, Spy putting a second Aggressive Stance 54017 ("Max 1 per player") into play while one is attached.**
  **Answered: owner 37 = A (2026-10-10), built in the engine: the second copy does not enter play and stays where it was.** As found:
  RRG "Play, Put into Play" (p. 32): a card put into play bypasses "any restrictions or prohibitions regarding playing that card". RRG "Max":
  "A player cannot take control of another copy of a 'Max 1 per player' card they already control." The RRG does not say which wins, and no
  ruling in `docs/rulings/marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md` names it. Today both copies end up attached to the identity (put into play wins).
  Needs an owner answer; if the Max entry should win, the fix is in the engine's put-into-play path (one check), not in the script.

### Read against the card text, not covered by a new test

Script reads correct against the printed text, and the module tests assert them: Lethal Protector (an own attack that defeats; 2 threat removed,
not thwarted), Cybernetically Enhanced (cost, compulsory search of deck and discard, shuffle), Black Widow's response (played from the hand,
Attack events only), Silent Infiltration, Winter Mask's Spy trait and draw, Winter Rifle (basic attacks by the hero only, +2 ATK, piercing and
ranged), Metal Punch and Arm Block (the Arm's note), Electrical Discharge's energy stun, Red Room Programming (highest printed cost, ties, an
empty hand), Crossbones' Quickstrike and Forced Response, Hydra Hit Squad's stats and When Defeated, High-Tech Armament's attachment target and
activation, Captain America's and Deathlok's responses, Firepower (owner answer Q21 = B: one attack, up to three assignments, guard re-read per
assignment), One by One (a reprint of 28014), Aggressive Stance, Bambino, Man on the Wall's reduction, Sidearm, Nick Fury, Sr. (a reprint of
50054), Super-Soldiers and Winter, Widow, Soldier, Spy, White Widow's `abilityResolved` heal and S.H.I.E.L.D. Deputy (erratum, RRG p. 70).

### Thin coverage and open points

- **Winter Armor 54009 leaving play with damage.** RRG "Hit Points": when "+X hit points" ceases to be in effect the dial is reduced by X, so a
  hero with 11 or more damage whose Armor is discarded is defeated. Not tested: nothing in the pack discards an upgrade, and surgery would skip
  the engine path under test. The module tests cover only the back-to-11 case with no damage over it.
- **Sidearm 54020 defeating the attack's target before the attack.** A Shocker with 1 hit point left, a basic attack declared against it, and
  the Sidearm interrupt's 1 damage defeats it first. Whether the attack is canceled and whether "attack and defeat" responses (Lethal Protector)
  are offered is not stated by the RRG or any ruling found; not tested.
- **High-Tech Armament 54030 revealed to an enemy that is stunned or confused.** "That enemy activates against you" should spend the status
  card (RRG "Stun, Stunned"), but Armament is dealt after the villain and the minions have activated, so the status cards are spent first and
  the harness cannot stop between steps. Needs a stepwise driver (`driveStepwise`) with surgery at the moment the card is revealed. The
  interaction with Fixer 53038 is `it.todo` in the module test (engine task 35).
- **Red Room Programming 54027 in a two-player game** (given to the Bucky Barnes player) and the choice of where to put indirect damage with an
  ally in play are not tested.
- **Cybernetic Arm and Super-Soldiers/Firepower together with Team-Up in a game with Captain America under the other player's control**: only
  Super-Soldiers with the Arm absent is tested.
- No FFG ruling in the file names a `winter` card except Ruling January 17, 2026 - Ruling 2 and Ruling March 6, 2026 - Ruling 1 (1) (Arm
  Block, both already asserted by the module tests). No conflict between the RRG and a ruling was found for this pack. The RRG's "Encounter Deck"
  sentence on emptied discards and the module comment on Spoiling for a Fight ("a cost") read differently; the game follows the RRG sentence.

## Falcon (falcon)

Scope: 53001a/b to 53037 (scripts in `packages/cards/src/wave9/falcon/`: the hero's identity, events, support-upgrades-allies and
obligation-nemesis modules and `aspect-basic.ts`; data in `packages/content/src/data/falcon/cards.ts`). The `techno` module is not scripted and
was not audited. Every script was read against the printed text in the data. Regression tests: `packages/cards/src/wave9/falcon/rulings.qa.test.ts`
(19 tests, 1 of them `it.fails` pinning the finding below, with a companion test that pins today's behavior). The module tests are thorough
(about 400 cases, including the owner's Q6, Q34 and Q35 cases and the Redwing FAQ cases of rulings January 26 and March 19, 2026); this file holds
only interactions they do not assert. Already-recorded gaps (Aerial Recon's action, Talon Line in a real game, Redwing's exhaust cost, Captain
America's Shield set-aside, Strength in Diversity, and the swapped-in boost card of Up, Up, and Away) were not re-reported.

| 53009 Aerial Recon / 53031 Serpent Solutions | "Interrupt: When a player would be dealt an encounter card, remove 1 recon counter from here instead." `docs/phase7-wave9.md` section 3.45 says the interrupt hears every deal to any player, "a card's 'deal ... as a facedown encounter card' (Serpent Solutions, The Raft)", and lists "Serpent Solutions' deal of a discarded minion replaced: the minion stays in the encounter discard pile" as a test (RRG 1.8 "Deal, Deal an Encounter Card" p. 15). | Aerial Recon is never offered for Serpent Solutions' deal: the engine does not announce a named-card deal (`trigger-events.ts`, `TriggerEvent encounterCardBeingDealt`, "Not announced: ... a named card dealt to a player"), so the Soldier is dealt facedown to the first player and the recon counter stays. The script is right. | Medium   |

The fix needs the engine (a "would be dealt" window in `dealAsEncounterCards`, whose replacement leaves the named card where it is, in the
discard pile), not a script change; if the owner prefers the engine comment's reading (a named card is not "taken from the deck", so it is not a
deal the interrupt hears), the spec's section 3.45 line and test list are what change. The same text names The Raft 51018 (Black Panther), which
would be answered by the same fix. It is pinned: `it.fails` for the expected behavior and a passing test for today's. When it is fixed, flip the
`it.fails` to `it` and delete its companion.

### Checked, no findings

- **A stunned or confused Falcon and Bird of Prey 53003 / Bird's-Eye View 53004 (RRG "Labeled Ability" p. 26, "Stun, Stunned" p. 41, "Confuse,
  Confused" p. 13; ruling August 13, 2026 - Ruling 1 (1)).** Stunned plus Bird of Prey (attack): the event is played and spent and Eagle-Eyed is
  still offered, but no damage is dealt, the stun card is removed and the optional discard does not happen (the top card stays on the deck: the
  discard is part of the canceled effect, not a cost). Confused plus Bird of Prey: 4 + 3 damage, the confused card stays. Confused plus
  Bird's-Eye View (thwart): nothing removed, the confused card goes, the top card stays. Stunned plus Bird's-Eye View: 3 + 3 threat removed, the
  stunned card stays.
- **Redwing 53002's action with status cards on Falcon (RRG FAQ "Redwing (#2)" p. 65).** The damage is neither an attack nor a thwart, so a
  Falcon who is both stunned and confused uses it in full and both cards stay.
- **Tough (RRG p. 44).** Bird of Prey at a tough minion: the top card is discarded and the +X read, but all the damage is prevented and the tough
  card is spent. Redwing's "deal X damage" at a tough minion likewise (damage from an ability is damage).
- **Aerial Evacuation 53008 and Overkill (ruling March 6, 2026 - Ruling 1 (2); RRG "Overkill" p. 31).** Control: Rhino with Charge (ATK 5,
  overkill) against a defending Redwing defeats him and 3 excess lands on Falcon. With Evacuation the damage to Redwing is prevented, he is not
  defeated, no excess reaches Falcon, and Falcon changes to alter-ego form.
- **Vibranium Microweave 53013 with exactly 1 damage.** "Prevent 1 of that damage and deal 1 damage to an enemy": a 1-damage attack is prevented
  in full (Falcon takes 0) and the 1 damage to the chosen minion is still dealt; the upgrade is exhausted.
- **Draw Their Fire 53011 in a two-player game.** The rule covers Falcon only: the other player's hero attacked in the same villain phase still
  exhausts to defend.
- **Eagle-Eyed 53001a in a two-player game.** The other player playing an Aerial card does not offer it to Falcon's player and discards nothing
  ("After _you_ play").
- **Harlem's Protector 53029 with Falcon as the second seat.** Dealt to the first player (Spider-Man) and revealed, it is given to the Sam Wilson
  player: it lands in P2's play area with 3 emergency counters and not in P1's. (The villain activates once against each player, so a two-player
  villain phase turns two boost cards before the first deal.)
- **Serpent Solutions 53031 and the first player.** With P2 as the first player, the Serpent Soldier Eagle-Eyed discards is dealt facedown to P2,
  not to Falcon's player.
- **Up, Up, and Away 53005 on an attack against another player (RRG "Labeled Ability" p. 26: a (defense) ability initiated during an attack makes
  the identity the defender).** Offered for Rhino's attack on P2 as well as on Falcon (the card names no target); taking it makes Falcon the
  defender, so that hit lands on Falcon. Declined both times, the two hits land on Falcon and on P2.
- **Viper 53030 with a deck of three (RRG "Encounter Deck" p. 17).** Of the five cards, three are discarded, the deck is reset (one acceleration
  token) and the discard stops: the other two are not taken from the new deck. The module header's "one at a time with the deck reset if it
  empties" reads as if it continued; the game follows the RRG sentence.

### Read against the card text, not covered by a new test

Script reads correct against the printed text, and the module tests assert them: Falcon's constant (hero face, player phase only, hidden again
in the villain phase), Eagle-Eyed (any Aerial card played, no limit), Birds of a Feather (cost, compulsory search of deck and discard, shuffle,
limit across flips per ruling January 26, 2026 - Ruling 6 (2)), the Q6 = A switch shared by Bird of Prey, Bird's-Eye View, Redwing and
Battlefield Awareness (a facedown top card per ruling March 19, 2026 - Ruling 5), Falcon's Flock (once per card paid, owner question 36 built on
A), Soup Kitchen (heal equal to REC, the next ally or support), Draw Their Fire, Talon Line (stars count; Q35 = A), Aerial Recon's interrupt, Serpent
Society cards, Adder-tisement, and the whole of `aspect-basic.ts` (reprints aliased to their sources; Spectrum, Resource Reserve, Flight Squadron,
Hugin & Munin, Misty Knight, Ops Room, Wingman, Winter Soldier, Captain America's action).

### Thin coverage and open points

- **Piercing against Aerial Evacuation (ruling January 17, 2026 - Ruling 3 (2)).** Piercing removes a tough card before Evacuation prevents
  the damage taken. Not tested: it needs an ally with a tough card defending a piercing attack, and no piercing enemy attack was staged; the engine's
  Piercing and Tough are tested in the Winter Soldier file against Winter Rifle.
- **Battlefield Awareness 53010 on a basic attack replaced by a stun or a confuse.** Whether "uses a basic power" is true when the stunned
  Falcon's attack is canceled (RRG "Stun" says costs are still paid and he "is not considered to have attacked") is not stated for this wording and
  no ruling names it; not tested.
- **Misty Knight 53036 discarding the second of the top 2 cards when it is a Serpent Society minion with Serpent Solutions in play.** RRG
  "Discard" (p. 16): cards looked at from the top and discarded "are considered to have been discarded from the top of that deck", so Solutions
  should hear it; no test combines the two cards.
- **Hugin & Munin 53017 searching the top 10 while the top card is faceup (Falcon's player phase).** The module tests cover the search; none
  checks that the new top card is shown (and logged) afterward.
- **Up, Up, and Away 53005 on a minion's boost card against another player.** The test staging used Rhino's attacks (the minion engaged with P2
  was not dealt a boost card in the harness); the offer for a minion's attack is covered only for the single-player case by the module tests.
- No FFG ruling in the file names a `falcon` card outside Rulings December 17, 2025 - Ruling 1 (2), January 17, 2026 - Ruling 3 (2), January 26,
  2026 - Ruling 6, March 6, 2026 - Ruling 1 (2), March 19, 2026 - Ruling 5, June 25, 2026 - Ruling 1 and July 9, 2026 - Ruling 2, all of them
  asserted by the module tests or this file's. No conflict between the RRG and a ruling was found for this pack.

## Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Maria Hill, Nick Fury and the box's player cards (aos)

Scope: 50001a/b to 50011 (Maria Hill's identity, events, supports, upgrades and ally; `packages/cards/src/wave9/aos/maria-hill/`), 50034a/b to
50046 (Nick Fury's identity, events, suit form, upgrades and ally; `aos/nick-fury/`), the obligations and nemesis sets 50029 to 50033 and 50059
to 50063 (read against the printed text; their interactions with the heroes' cards are covered below) and `aos/aspect-basic.ts` (50012 to 50028
and 50047 to 50058). The scenarios and the other encounter sets are a later audit. Data: `packages/content/src/data/aos/cards.ts`. Every
script was read against the printed text in the data. Regression tests: `packages/cards/src/wave9/aos/heroes-rulings.qa.test.ts` (32 tests, none
of them `it.fails`). The module tests are thorough (about 700 cases across the five Maria Hill and Nick Fury files and `aspect-basic.test.ts`,
including the owner's Q16 to Q20 and Q22 and Q23 cases); this file holds only interactions they do not assert.

### Findings

None. Every case written against an RRG entry, a ruling or an owner decision passed once the test staging was right (the early failures were
mistakes in the staging, not in the game: a second player's turn that was never ended, an encounter card dealt at random to the second player
that discarded the support under test, a `take` list that overwrote the interrupt being tested, and two schemes standing in for the one the
test meant to aim at). Two source conflicts and one open rules point are recorded below rather than picked.

### Checked, no findings

- **A stunned or confused Nick Fury (RRG "Stun, Stunned" p. 41, "Confuse, Confused" p. 13, "Replacement Effect" p. 37, "Interrupt" p. 25;
  ruling August 13, 2026 - Ruling 1 (1)).** The stun and confuse cards are replacement effects, so no interrupt or response to the replaced
  attack or thwart is heard. A stunned Fury in Stealth who makes a basic attack spends the stun, Break Cover does not fire (the suit stays on
  Stealth) and Assault is not offered; the same stunned Fury playing Concentrated Fire 50037 or Spray Fire 50039 still plays the event (spent,
  discarded) with no damage, no choice and no form change. A confused Fury's basic thwart offers no Gather Intel, and a confused Maria Hill ally's
  thwart offers no "when Maria Hill thwarts" interrupt, so nothing reaches the suit. A stunned Fury's Covert Surveillance (thwart) works in full
  (stun cancels only an attack); a confused Fury's cancels the whole labeled ability (RRG "Labeled Ability" p. 26), including the optional
  change to Stealth.
- **The crisis icon (RRG "Crisis Icon" p. 14).** With Crowd Control in play the main scheme is not offered as a target of All-Points Bulletin,
  Covert Surveillance or Secret Agent's move (the side scheme is), and the main scheme keeps its threat. (The Douglass 50019 ignoring crisis is
  asserted by the module tests.)
- **Stealth 50035b and the attack it replaces (RRG "Replacement Effect" p. 37, "Interrupt" p. 25).** With Life Model Decoy attached, Rhino's
  attack becomes a scheme and the Decoy is not offered (further interrupts to the replaced attack cannot trigger). With Eyepatch Camera
  attached, the camera is asked about the 1 threat Stealth left for the main scheme (a range of 0 to 1), not the activation's full 2.
- **Two-player cases (ruling December 17, 2025 - Ruling 3; RRG "Attack (Enemy Activation)" p. 8).** Stealth makes Rhino scheme against Fury only:
  the attack on the second player's hero still lands. Fury's Life Model Decoy is offered for the attack on Fury and not again for the attack on
  the second player. Secret Agent does not hear a Preparation card the second player resolves (Prism Dust attached to their identity), while
  Prism Dust itself is offered to its own controller. Press Conference 50029 (given to the Maria Hill player) removes a counter only from that
  player's supports; the Nick Fury player's Support Staff keeps its three.
- **Life Model Decoy 50010 and an ally defender (RRG p. 8).** The Decoy is used when the attack initiates, before a defender is declared; with a
  Maria Hill ally declared as defender afterwards, the ally takes no damage either ("prevent all damage from that attack").
- **Prism Dust 50052 is labeled (attack) (RRG "Labeled Ability" p. 26, "Stun" p. 41).** A stunned Fury pays the discard cost, but the whole
  ability is canceled: the minion that entered play is neither confused nor damaged, and the stun card is spent.
- **Concentrated Fire 50037 at a tough minion (RRG "Tough" p. 44, "Defeat" p. 15).** The 4 damage is prevented, the tough card is spent, the
  minion stays in play and no "defeats an enemy" choice follows.
- **Intelligence Analysis 50045 (RRG "Cancel" p. 11, "Surge" p. 42; ruling August 3, 2026 - Ruling 3).** Canceling Kree Manipulator (Surge) cancels
  its effects and its surge together: only one encounter card is revealed (a control run reveals two), and the threat it would place is not
  placed. The canceled treachery is still "revealed", so Grant Ward 50022's "after you reveal a treachery" Forced Response still answers it; and
  Analysis's own ability still resolves, so Secret Agent 50046 is offered afterward (it moves 1 threat from the main scheme to the suit).
- **Maria Hill's trait grant (card text 50001a).** Sky-Destroyer's "after you play a S.H.I.E.L.D. card" answers a Core ally played in hero
  form (the ally has the trait by the time the response window opens) and does not in alter-ego form. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 50015 is not
  offered to alter-ego Maria Hill who controls a Core ally.
- **Printed cost (RRG "Printed" p. 35).** The Hard Call discarding Jemma Simmons deals 3 (her printed cost), not the 1 she cost to play. On the
  Double sums printed costs: Jemma (3) with Sky-Destroyer (3) is accepted, Jemma with Command Team (2) and Sky-Destroyer is refused (8).
- **Two Special Funding 50007 on one support.** Sky-Destroyer (cost 3) paid with two copies gets two counters (each copy is its own response).
- **A confused minion's scheme (RRG "Confuse" p. 13, "Replacement Effect" p. 37).** Informant 50050 and Quake 50048 hear nothing when a
  confused minion's scheme is replaced by removing the status card.

### Read against the card text, not covered by a new test

Script reads correct against the printed text, and the module tests assert them: Maria Hill's trait grant and Reassignment (limit, retyping,
a uses support emptied), her search; Nick Fury's Gather Intel, Break Cover, Suit Up and Infiltrate; All-Points Bulletin, On the Double (the
spec 3.11 gate), Reinforcements, Special Funding; Support Staff, The Iliad, Life Model Decoy, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director; Concentrated Fire, Covert
Surveillance and Spray Fire (owner question 16, Guard); Assault (owner question 17), Stealth, Maria Hill 50036, Fury's Flying Car, Safe House
#221, EM Shield, Eyepatch Camera, Fury's Watch, Intelligence Analysis, Secret Agent; every card of `aspect-basic.ts` (Front Organization
under owner question 20 = B, Intelligence under question 19 = B, Organizational Support, Super Spies under question 18 = A, the reprints
aliased to their sources); Press Conference, Controller, Army of the Controlled, Controlled Innocents, Diabolical Discs, Discovered, Orion,
Acquire Infinity Formula, Leviathan Soldier and Cold Storage.

### Open point (pinned, not an `it.fails`)

- **Practiced Plan 50058 and a Preparation card discarded from the hand.** Owner question 20 = B reads "a card you control" as including the
  hand and deck (RRG "Ownership and Control" p. 31) for Front Organization. Practiced Plan says "After you discard a Preparation card you
  control". The script hears only a Preparation card leaving play to the discard pile, so a Preparation card discarded from the hand (by the
  hand-size discard, or at random by Klaw's Vengeance) is not heard. No ruling says whether that is "you discard". Pinned as today's behavior;
  if the owner wants the question 20 reading here too, the change is in the script's trigger (a `cardBeingDiscarded` listener beside
  `cardLeavesPlay`), not the engine.

### Source conflicts (flagged, not picked)

- **"When/After [enemy] attacks you": player or character.** RRG 1.8 "Attack (Enemy Activation)" (p. 8) and "Attacks Against Allies" (p. 8) say abilities that trigger "When/After [enemy] attacks you" resolve when a player is attacked, "regardless of which
  character they control was attacked". The ruling of December 17, 2025 - Ruling 3 says the exception covers "After [enemy] attacks you"
  only and that Nick Fury's Stealth Suit ("when an enemy would attack") "only triggers when Nick Fury would be attacked". They disagree on
  "When" wording (Life Model Decoy 50010 is "When an enemy attacks you", Stealth "When an enemy would attack you"). The scripts follow the
  character reading for "would attack" and the player reading for "after" (owner question 5 = A). The tests here assert only cases both
  sources agree on (an attack on another player; an ally defending after the Decoy was used).
- **Surge when a treachery's When Revealed is canceled.** The FAQ for Spider-Man Noir (RRG FAQ, p. 63) says a keyword
  "like surge or incite X" still resolves when the When Revealed ability is canceled, so his response can trigger. RRG 1.8 "Surge" (p. 42, revised
  in 1.8) defines surge as the When Revealed ability "Deal yourself 1 facedown encounter card", and the ruling of August 3, 2026 - Ruling 3 says
  surge "is treated as a When Revealed ability and can be cancelled". The game follows the later ruling (Intelligence Analysis cancels the surge
  too); the Noir FAQ predates the revised definition and was not changed. Worth confirming that the Noir entry is superseded.

### Thin coverage and open points

- **"After [hero] uses a basic power" under a replaced action (Nick Fury 50002 and Melinda May 50023).** Whether a confused ally's thwart or a
  stunned ally's attack is "a basic power used" is not stated for these wordings (RRG "Stun" says the character "is not considered to have
  attacked", with no matching line under "Confuse"); not tested.
- **Dum Dum Dugan 50021 stunned or confused.** His interrupt is "when you use one of his basic powers"; whether it is offered when the power's
  effect is then replaced is not stated and not tested.
- **Informant 50050 and Stealth on the same minion scheme.** Both change where the activation's threat goes (Informant removes it, Stealth
  diverts 1 of it); the order and the result are not pinned by any source and were not tested.
- **Orion 50060 and Acquire Infinity Formula 50061 against EM Shield 50042 in one villain phase.** Prevented damage is not "taken", so Orion
  should gain nothing from the prevented hit; module tests cover each card alone, no test combines them with a second attacker.
- **Two Maria Hill or two Nick Fury players.** Not staged; the suit form, Press Conference and the obligations all key on the identity name or the
  controller.
- No FFG ruling in the file names Maria Hill or the other cards of this box outside Rulings December 17, 2025 - Ruling 3 (Stealth Suit, above)
  and the August 13 and August 3, 2026 rulings used here for the stun and surge cases.

## Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Black Widow, Batroc and M.O.D.O.K. scenarios (aos)

Scope: the first three scenarios of the box and their sets. Black Widow 50064 to 50079 (`aos/black-widow.ts`), A.I.M. Abduction 50080 to 50082
(`aim-abduction.ts`), A.I.M. Science 50083 to 50085 (`aim-science.ts`), Batroc 50086 to 50097 (`batroc.ts`), Batroc's Brigade 50098 to 50102
(`batrocs-brigade.ts`), M.O.D.O.K. 50103 to 50124 (`modok.ts`), Scientist Supreme 50125 to 50128 (`scientist-supreme.ts`) and S.H.I.E.L.D. 50178
to 50180 (`shield.ts`). Thunderbolts, Baron Zemo, the Executive Board and the Thunderbolt minion sets are a later audit. Data:
`packages/content/src/data/aos/cards.ts`. Every script was read against the printed text in the data and the box rulebook
(`docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc50_agents_of_shield.md`, pp. 9, 11, 13 and the FAQ on p. 22). Regression tests:
`packages/cards/src/wave9/aos/scenarios-rulings.qa.test.ts` (37 tests, 1 of them `it.fails` pinning the open finding below, each with a companion test
that pins today's behavior; the Grunt, Attacrobatics and hero-defeat cases). The module tests and the scenario games are thorough (the eleven
`aos` module and scenario files hold about 900 cases, including the owner's Q3, Q4 (single target), Q5, Q24, Q25 and Q33 cases); this file holds
only interactions they do not assert: status cards on the villain (stunned, steady, stalwart), crisis icons against the box's own allies and
villains, an attack with several targets, expert mode at stage 3B, villain stage changes, two-player attacker and "engaged player" cases, and
Maria Hill's trait grant against the S.H.I.E.L.D. set.

| Black Widow 1: 50073 A.I.M. Grunt with 50039 Spray Fire (any attack with several targets) | Owner Q4 = A (`docs/phase7-wave9.md` 4.1, provisional; 3.4 spells it out): "this attack" is the whole attack, so "resolve this attack against A.I.M. Grunt instead" makes the Grunt "its only target, for 3 damage once". Spray Fire on her with a minion engaged and the Grunt discarded: the Grunt takes 3, she takes 0, the other minion takes 0 (MC50 p. 9; ruling January 17, 2026 - Ruling 2 for the single-target case).          | Only her share moves: the Grunt takes 3, the other minion still takes its own 3, and the Grunt, which is now also a minion engaged with the chosen player, takes its own 3 too: 6 in all, defeated (5 hit points). She takes 0. The single-target case (the scenario games) is right. **Fixed** in the engine (owner Q4 = A): a retargeted "(attack)" ability has the new target as its only target. | Engine (`retargetPlayerAttack` / the retarget of a player attack with several targets must leave the new minion the only target). Not a script change. |

Under Q4 = A the attack is all of Spray Fire and all its damage to every target is prevented (the game does this, tested), so "that much" is 3 for her plus 3 for the minion: the attacker takes 6.                                                                                                                             | The attacker takes 3: the script reads `attackPreventedAmount("prevented")`, the share aimed at her. **Fixed** (one line in the script; the test now asserts the expected behavior).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Fixed                                                                                                                                                  |

### Checked, no findings

- **Spray Fire 50039 on Black Widow, the cases that agree with Q4 = A.** With no Preparation on top, she and the engaged minion each take 3 and her
  interrupt fires once for the one attack (1 threat off the main scheme, one card discarded). With Night Vision Goggles attached and a card with
  no printed Preparation on top, the granted Preparation prevents all the damage to every target, and the Goggles are discarded.
- **Stun Net 50071 and Grappling Hook 50069 against attack events (RRG "Labeled Ability" p. 26: an (attack)-labeled ability is an attack made by
  the identity; "Cancel" p. 11).** A hero wearing the Net cannot play Haymaker (an attack event); the same play without the Net is legal. A Hook on
  Black Widow cancels a Haymaker aimed at her: the event is still played and discarded, her Forced Interrupt never fires (no threat removed, no
  card discarded), and the Hook is discarded. An ally who attacks her wears the Net afterwards and cannot attack again; the hero is not netted.
- **Black Widow's Gauntlet 50068.** With Night Vision Goggles attached and a card with no printed Preparation on top, the Goggles' granted
  Preparation counts as "a Preparation ability was resolved": the Gauntlet stays (control: without the Goggles it may be discarded). In a
  two-player game the response is offered to the attacking second player only and discards the Gauntlet when taken. The Gauntlet's retaliate 1
  answers the stroke that defeats stage I, and the Gauntlet and her stunned status card are on stage II (RRG "Villain Defeat" p. 47: the new stage is
  the same character and attachments and status cards carry over).
- **Destroy Evidence 50075 (RRG "Incite X" p. 24: a revealed card).** A.I.M. Soldier revealed gains incite 1 (+1 threat); the Scientist it puts
  into play was not revealed, so it gets no incite and its printed Surge does not reveal another card (only the Soldier is revealed).
- **Batroc stunned (RRG "Stun, Stunned" p. 41: "not considered to have attacked"; MC50 p. 22).** His attack is replaced by removing the stun, nobody
  is hurt and no threat goes on Alert Level (his Forced Response is "After Batroc attacks").
- **Crisis icon (RRG "Crisis Icon" p. 14; "Card Types" p. 12: ally is a player card type).** Batroc's Forced Interrupt still removes its 6 threat from
  the main scheme with a crisis side scheme in play (an encounter card's ability). A Rescued Captive's Hero Action cannot be used on the main
  scheme under a crisis icon (the ability has no valid target) and removes 1 without one. Flying Inhuman's "remove 1 threat from another scheme"
  after thwarting a crisis side scheme cannot take the main scheme (no main-scheme target is offered, its threat is unchanged).
- **Extract Captives 3B in expert mode (card text 50089b; RRG "Quickstrike" p. 36; owner Q25 = A).** An Embassy Patrol revealed engages the hero in
  hero form and its quickstrike attack is redirected to the Rescued Captive; the hero takes nothing.
- **Batroc's Brigade 50101 and Soldiers of Fortune 50102.** A Mercenary found by Soldiers of Fortune and revealed offers the Brigade's Hero
  Interrupt; taken (3 resources), Machete is discarded without entering play, Soldiers of Fortune gains surge ("if no minion entered play this
  way") and the canceled Machete's own Surge does not reveal a second card. The interrupt is not offered to a player who cannot spend 3. The
  Soldiers of Fortune boost does not offer "spend 1 resource" to a player with nothing to spend (owner Q33 = A): it gains its 3 icons with no choice.
- **Zaran 50100 (RRG "Tuck" p. 45).** Defeated, the card tucked under him goes to its owner's discard pile, not the encounter discard pile or the
  victory display.
- **M.O.D.O.K.'s status cards.** A damage-proof M.O.D.O.K. (Hostage Situation in play) still draws retaliate 1 when attacked (RRG "Retaliate X"
  p. 38: "after ... is attacked", no damage needed). Psionic Force Field gives stalwart: a Mockingbird stun cannot be placed on him (control: it
  lands). Expert M.O.D.O.K. (steady, RRG "Steady" p. 41): one stunned card does not stop his attack and stays; two stop it and both are removed.
- **Sarah Garza 50107b against a tough Adaptoid (ruling January 26, 2026 - Ruling 3: overkill counts damage taken).** The tough card absorbs
  her 2 damage, the Adaptoid takes nothing, so nothing spills onto M.O.D.O.K. (control: without the card 1 spills).
- **"It's Alive!" 50123 with Flying Upgrade 50109.** Each Adaptoid a player finds and reveals gains incite 1: two players, two more threat than
  without the upgrade.
- **A.I.M. Scientist 50083 against an attack with several targets.** With another minion engaged, Spray Fire leaves the Scientist out (no damage)
  and the other minion and the villain take 3; engaged with the Scientist alone it is a target and is defeated (2 hit points).
- **Maria Hill's trait grant against the S.H.I.E.L.D. set.** Disavowed 50180's When Revealed counts Hill's identity and a Core ally she controls
  (2 starting + 2). A S.H.I.E.L.D. Trooper 50178 defeated while its player controls only a Core ally: the ally (a S.H.I.E.L.D. ally by the grant)
  is discarded and no threat is placed. In a two-player game where the second player defeats a Trooper engaged with the first, the first player
  (the engaged player) discards their S.H.I.E.L.D. support and the second keeps theirs.
- **Disavowed 50180 and a Core ally in Hill's hand.** Black Cat in her hand costs 2, then 3 under Disavowed; a S.H.I.E.L.D. support (1 to 2)
  likewise; a Core support (Aunt May) stays at 1. See the open point below.

### Read against the card text, not covered by a new test

Script reads correct against the printed text, and the module tests and scenario games assert them: Black Widow's Forced Interrupt on all three
stages (crisis, empty scheme, empty deck, second player), The Widow's Web (setup, X per hero), the four attachments, A.I.M. Commando (quickstrike
after the attack) and Grunt (single-target retarget), Automated Defenses, the four treacheries; A.I.M. Abduction (Abductor, Abduct Superhumans,
Nabbed!, the ally limit and the return); A.I.M. Science (Soldier, Mad Science, the Scientist's per-player lock); Batroc's reset and Forced
Response, the three stages and Alert Level on both faces, Rescued Captive, Heightened Reflexes, Embassy Guard and Patrol, Commandeer Security
Office, Leaping Kick, Security Cameras; Machete, Rapido, Zaran's ATK; M.O.D.O.K.'s reset (owner Q3 = A), Upgrading Adaptoids, the four Holding
Cells and Inhumans (owner Q24 = A), the four upgrades, the six attachments, A.I.M. Jailer, Hostage Situation, Psionic Enhancement, Psionic
Blast; Scientist Supreme, Monica Rappaccini, Diplomatic Immunity and Sanctions; Arrest Warrant. No new test was written for these.

### Open point (pinned, not an `it.fails`)

- **Maria Hill's grant for a card in her hand.** RRG "Ownership and Control" p. 31 says "a player controls the cards in their own out-of-play
  areas", and Hill prints "Each ally you control gains the S.H.I.E.L.D. trait". Read literally, an ally in her hand is a S.H.I.E.L.D. card, and
  that is what the game does (Black Cat costs 1 more under Disavowed in her hand). It is also how owner question 20 = B reads "a card you control".
  No ruling covers Hill's grant; if the owner prefers "in play only", the cost modifier and the Practiced Plan reading would change together.

### Source conflicts (flagged, not picked)

- **Overkill and a replaced defeat.** MC50 p. 22 (the FAQ) says "Overkill damage is simultaneous with the damage from the attack" and uses that to
  order M.O.D.O.K.'s "would be defeated" interrupt before the Adaptoid's When Defeated. Owner Q31 = A says that when the attacked minion's defeat is
  replaced the excess is dealt "once the minion is defeated" (no spill), and rejects "strict simultaneity" as answer B. The two agree on the
  M.O.D.O.K. case (tested by the module and the scenario game) and differ in wording for a replaced defeat. Worth confirming that the FAQ's
  "simultaneous" is only about the order of the two abilities.
- **Q4 against the RRG wording of Attacrobatics.** Nothing conflicts, but the owner marked Q4 provisional and the two Black Widow findings above are
  both its consequences; if it flips to B, the Grunt test and the Attacrobatics expectation change with it.

### Thin coverage and open points

- **Heightened Reflexes 50092 on a tough Batroc.** Batroc's Brigade gives each enemy a tough status card (Batroc included). Whether the tough card
  or Heightened Reflexes' interrupt acts first, and whether the leap counter is removed when the tough card prevented the damage, is not stated by
  the RRG or a ruling; not tested.
- **Q22 (a surge outside the villain phase) is not exercised by this scope.** The only player-phase reveal in these sets is Arrest Warrant, and
  the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trooper it finds has no surge.
- **Spray Fire against a Guard minion on Black Widow (owner Q16 = A).** Covered by the Nick Fury tests, not combined with her Preparations.
- **The Grunt's retarget with an ally's attack.** Only a hero's attack is combined with the Grunt (scenario game C); the ally-attack variant is
  not tested.
- **A.I.M. Abductor's order (50080).** The printed text puts "If Abduct Superhumans is not in play, find it" last; the script finds it first
  (documented in the script: nothing can be tucked under a scheme that is not there). Not changed here.
- **Nabbed! with no ally in the deck (50082).** The script places the acceleration token though nothing was tucked (documented reading,
  tested by the module); no source says either way.
- **Psionic Upgrade (villainous) on a stunned Adaptoid.** Whether a replaced activation is "uses a basic power" and so is dealt a boost card is not
  stated; not tested.
- **Two-player Arrest Warrant and Disavowed.** Arrest Warrant held by the second player and Disavowed counting two players' cards are not staged.
- **The Gauntlet's response is offered even when it will do nothing.** Its "if no Preparation ability was resolved" is read as a condition of the
  effect, not of the trigger, so a player can take a response that discards nothing. Harmless; the RRG's "Triggering Condition" does not say
  whether an "if" clause belongs to the trigger.
- No FFG ruling in the file names a card of these scenarios beyond January 17, 2026 - Ruling 2 (Black Widow's interrupt and the Grunt, asserted by
  the scenario game), January 26, 2026 - Ruling 4 and April 30, 2026 - Ruling 3 (flipping Alert Level is not a reveal, asserted by the Batroc
  module) and January 26, 2026 - Ruling 3 (overkill counts damage taken, used above).

## Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Thunderbolts, the Thunderbolt minion sets and the Executive Board (aos, bp, silk)

Scope: the Thunderbolts scenario 50129a to 50138 (`aos/thunderbolts.ts`), the six `aos` Thunderbolt minion sets Gravitational Pull 50139 to 50142,
Hard Sound 50143 to 50147, Pale Little Spider 50148 to 50151, Power of the Atom 50152 to 50155, Supersonic 50156 to 50160 and The Leaper 50161 to
50164, the two hero-pack sets Extreme Risk 51039 to 51042 (`bp/extreme-risk.ts`) and Growing Strong 52035 to 52038 (`silk/growing-strong.ts`),
and the S.H.I.E.L.D. Executive Board 50181a to 50184c (`aos/executive-board.ts`). Baron Zemo is not in this audit. Data:
`packages/content/src/data/{aos,bp,silk}/cards.ts`. Every script was read against the printed text in the data, RRG 1.8, the rulings file and the
box rulebook (MC50 pp. 5 to 6, 15, 22). Regression tests: `packages/cards/src/wave9/aos/thunderbolts-rulings.qa.test.ts` (27 tests, 2 of them
`it.fails` pinning the four open findings below, each with a passing companion that pins today's behavior). The module tests and the two
Thunderbolts scenario games are thorough (about 500 cases for these sets); this file holds only interactions they do not assert: the held minion
against its own set's treachery, a stunned minion under "activates against you", what the swap keeps and what its engage triggers, guard against an
ally, "you" as the identity, a hard-coded chooser, a title two cards share, ranged from a boost, and the Executive Board's "then".

| Thunderbolts 1: 50132 Citizen V's Sword and 50134 Innocent Bystanders ("After you attack") | RRG "You, Your" p. 49: for a trigger "after you attack and defeat an enemy" the identity must be the one that performed it; it triggers "after the controlling player's identity attacks ... but not when an ally under that player's control attacks". The only exception is "after [enemy] attacks you". So an ally's attack on Citizen V does not offer the Sword's discard response, and an ally's attack on an enemy removes no bystander counter and asks for no resource or threat.                  | Both scripts take `query(["identity", "ally"])` as the attacker with `byYou`, so Black Cat's attack offers the Sword response (spend two physical to discard it) and removes a bystander counter, as the identity's attack does. The repo's other "after you attack" cards use `YOUR_HERO` / `YOUR_IDENTITY` (core aggression, Thor, Winter Soldier). **Fixed** in the script; the test now asserts the expected behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Script: one line each (`query("identity")`, or `YOUR_IDENTITY`, for the attacker in `50132.citizen-vs-sword-response` and in the first branch of `50134.innocent-bystanders-forced-response`).

One-player games are unaffected. **Fixed** in the script; the test now asserts the expected behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Script: `placeSecrets` should choose by the revealing player (the player resolving the card; for the boost, the attacked player) instead of `firstPlayer`. Check that the payment then comes from that player's hand and resource abilities. The Board Member attachments' choices (no "you" printed) correctly stay with the first player. |
| Thunderbolts 3: 50181a to 50183a Chief Officers' Hero Action with no secret counter        | "Spend ... -> remove 1 secret counter from here. Then, [effect]." RRG "'Then'" p. 44: the text before "then" must be fully resolved before the rest is; "if the pre-'then' text does not fully resolve, the post-'then' text does not attempt to resolve". With no secret counter to remove, nothing is healed (the action may also be refused). MC50 p. 5: a secret is uncovered to get the help.                                                                                                          | The cost is paid, nothing is removed, and the heal of 1 still happens (tested on the Medical Officer; the Surveillance and Tactical Officers share the same shape). `removeCounters` in `resolve/apply-effect.ts` skips a card holding none (`removing <= 0 → continue`) without marking the instruction unresolved, so `then` runs. **Fixed** in the engine: a removal that takes fewer counters than it names leaves "Then" unresolved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Engine, small: a removal of an `amount` the card cannot supply (nothing, or fewer than asked) should count as unresolved for a following `then`. Alternatively a script-only guard on each of the three actions (`ifThen(valueAtLeast(countersOn(self, "secret"), 1), ...)`), but the engine rule is the general one.                       |
| Thunderbolts 4: 50163 Batroc the Leaper (and the same pattern in every set's treachery)    | "Find Batroc and reveal him. (If he is already in play, he engages you.) Batroc activates against you. If no enemy activated this way, this card gains surge." The Batroc found and revealed is the minion; in scenario two (villain "Batroc") a title shared by two cards is a referential ability, RRG "Referential Ability" p. 36. Intended: the minion activates once and the card does not surge. See the source gap below: the tie-break list is cut off in the repo's md copy.                       | `named(...)` (`select.ts`, case "named") returns the first card in play with the title, which is the villain: Batroc the villain attacks again for 4 and the minion he just revealed does not activate. The card then gains surge anyway ("If no enemy activated this way") although an enemy attacked. **Not a bug as first read.** The minion Batroc is blocked by the unique rule (RRG pp. 45 to 46), so the villain is the only "Batroc" in play and RRG "Referential Ability" (p. 36) names him; the extra card was the unique rule's dealt card, not a surge. A real bug beside it is fixed: a shared title now prefers the card on the ability's own side (a Black Widow ally no longer answers for the minion). Owner question 51. | Engine, small: `named` as the target of `enemyActivates` (and the other referential uses) should prefer the card the same ability just found or revealed, or a minion over a villain, per the referential list; plus a look at why `activated.made` stays 0 for the villain's activation.                                                   |

Each finding is pinned: `it.fails` for the expected behavior and a passing test for today's. When one is fixed, flip its `it.fails` to `it` and
delete its companion. Thunderbolts 1 is the strongest (the RRG text is explicit); Thunderbolts 4 depends on the referential list, which the md copy
does not print past item 1, so it should be read against the PDF's p. 36 before it is fixed.

### Checked, no findings

- **The held minion against its own set's treachery (RRG "Find" p. 19, "Engage" p. 18; MC50 p. 15).** Gravitational Pull revealed while Moonstone is
  the held minion finds her in play: she engages the revealer, is no longer held or attached, and attacks (a held minion cannot activate, so the
  attack proves she left). The other four `find` treacheries share the pattern and were not staged one by one.
- **Tap In against a stunned minion (RRG "Stun" p. 41, "Activation" p. 6).** The held minion Tap In engages is stunned: the stun is discarded, it
  does not attack, and "if no minion activated this way" is true, so Citizen V activates against the player. Hard Sound against a stunned,
  unengaged Songbird behaves the same: she engages, loses the stun, does not attack, and the card gains surge (the wave 4 reading for Waylay).
- **Thunderbolt Backup's swap keeps what is on the minions (MC50 p. 15).** The minion sent under the environment keeps its confused and tough
  status cards, its Blasters and its damage less the heal; the minion that comes out keeps its tough card and its attachment and engages the
  player the other was engaged with.
- **The swap's engage is an engage (RRG "Engage" p. 18).** With Coup de Foudre 50162 in play, the minion that comes out engages the player and the
  Forced Interrupt discards the top 4 cards of that player's deck (4 boost icons).
- **Guard from 50130b (RRG "Guard" p. 21).** A player's ally cannot attack Citizen V while a Thunderbolt minion is engaged with that player, and can
  attack the minion.
- **Apprehending Rogue Agents' Forced Response against an attack event and an ally.** Haymaker from the second player on the first player's
  minion, and Black Cat from the first player on the second player's minion, both engage the minion with the attacker's player. No source says an
  ally's attack is "a player attacks"; the rulebook (p. 15: "attacked by a player") and the script agree. Compare finding 1, where the RRG does
  speak.
- **Jolt 50133 and the victory display (RRG "Victory X" p. 46).** Jolt has no Victory keyword, so a defeated Jolt goes to the encounter discard pile,
  the display stays empty, and Citizen V at lethal damage stays in play.
- **A stunned hero and Innocent Bystanders (RRG "Stun" p. 41).** A stunned hero's attack is replaced by discarding the stun; it is not an attack,
  deals nothing and removes no bystander counter.
- **Hard Sound Bindings 50145 against an attack event (RRG "Attack (Player Ability Type)" p. 10).** Playing Haymaker with the Bindings on the hero:
  the attack is replaced, the Bindings are discarded, the hero is stunned, no damage is dealt, and the event is still played and discarded.
- **Pale Little Spider with two players.** Black Widow engaged with the second player schemes at them: only the second player is confused (no
  Handspring to find). Handspring 50149 against an ally's attack: the damage is dealt to the ally (the attacking character), Retaliate 1 answers it
  too, the minion takes nothing and the Handspring is discarded.
- **Runaway Nuclear Reaction 50154 (ruling January 26, 2026 - Ruling 3: damage dealt is not damage within hit points).** Radioactive Man at 17 of
  18 hit points takes a basic attack of 2 and is defeated; the scheme, still in play, answers and places the 2 dealt (5 to 7).
- **Rule the Skies 50140 (RRG "Character" p. 12).** Captain Marvel with Cosmic Flight deals 1 more with a basic attack while it is in play;
  without Cosmic Flight she does not.
- **Aerial Dogfight 50159.** Supersonic's boost ("it gains overkill and ranged") makes Rhino's attack ranged before damage, so the reduction of 2
  does not apply to the Aerial Captain Marvel (3 damage; a plain 1-icon boost is reduced to 1). A hero's basic attack reduced to 0 by Dogfight leaves
  the Aerial MACH-IV's tough status card in place (RRG "Tough" p. 44, defender bullet: damage reduced to 0 does not use up a tough card).
- **Executive Board.** A Hero Action cannot be used from the alter-ego form. A.I.M. Interference as a boost card places its counters but no
  incite threat on the main scheme (RRG "Incite X" p. 24: incite is "when revealed"; a boost card is not revealed).

### Read against the card text, not covered by a new test

Script reads correct against the printed text, and the module tests and scenario games assert them: Citizen V's constant and interrupt on both faces
(owner Q2 = A), the setup, the held minion's first reveal (owner Q26 = B), guard and the engage response, the swap (ties go to the new first player,
MC50 p. 22), the Sword's data and activation, Jolt's parley, The Coming Storm and Rumbling Thunder, Down but Not Out (owner Q29 = B), Tap In;
Moonstone's tough card, Rule the Skies, Gravitational Pull, Psychological Manipulation; Songbird, Solid Sound Constructs (stalwart and the
status replacement), Hard Sound Bindings, Sonic Bubble, Hard Sound; Black Widow's search and confusion, Handspring, Pride of the Red Room, Pale
Little Spider; Radioactive Man, Radiation Exposure (the RRG erratum on p. 69), Power of the Atom; MACH-IV's defender rule, Blasters, Heat-Seeking
Missiles, the rest of Aerial Dogfight, Supersonic; Batroc's discard, Coup de Foudre, Batroc the Leaper, Parcours du Combattant; Joystick, Energy
Truncheon, Playing for Keeps, Extreme Risk (the known card-made activation point excepted); Atlas, Grow Invulnerable, Growing Strong, Titanic
Proportions; the three Chief Officers' flip (owner Q1 = A) and Aids. No new test was written for these.

### Source conflicts (flagged, not picked)

- **Secret counters on the flip.** RRG "Flip" p. 20 discards every token when the new face has a different card type; MC50 pp. 6 and 11 and owner
  Q1 = A keep them. Already decided; the Board Member attachments are the only cards in the wave that rely on it.
- **Citizen V and "activates against you" (MC50 p. 22).** The rulebook FAQ and owner Q2 = A agree with RRG "Stun" for a stunned Citizen V; no
  conflict, noted because Tap In and the Sword activate him outside step two and so skip his interrupt (by the card text: "during step two").

### Thin coverage and open points

- **Referential list (RRG p. 36).** `docs/rules/mc_rulesreference_v18_compressed.md` prints only item 1 of the "Referential Ability" priority list; items 2
  onward are cut. Finding 4 and any other shared title ("Black Widow" is a Thunderbolt minion, the villain of scenario one, and a hero of the
  Black Widow pack; "Batroc" the minion and the villain) need the PDF's p. 36. Not tested: Pale Little Spider with the Black Widow hero or the
  Black Widow scenario, where `named("Black Widow")` has the same shape.
- **Tough and a replacement interrupt on the same damage.** Black Widow (expert: tough from Justice, Like Lightning) with Handspring attached, or
  any tough enemy under Sonic Bubble: both "would take damage" interrupts apply; the RRG says the first player orders simultaneous effects
  (p. 19) but gives no rule for tough against a card's own replacement, and no ruling covers it. Not tested.
- **Overkill and Sonic Bubble.** Ruling January 26, 2026 - Ruling 3 (overkill counts damage taken) implies a Sonic Bubble that turns the damage into
  threat removal leaves no excess for overkill; no overkill hero attack was staged.
- **Blasters 50157 "highest ATK" ties.** With MACH-IV absent and several enemies at the same highest ATK, who picks (the first player, RRG
  "First Player" p. 19) is not tested.
- **A.I.M. Interference as a boost with two players.** Finding 2 is tested on the reveal; the boost path (`resolveWhenRevealedOf`) shares
  `placeSecrets` and so the same chooser, not staged separately.
- **Quickstrike, steady, patrol, toughness, overkill on a held minion.** None of these sets prints quickstrike, steady, patrol or toughness. The
  Q25 quickstrike case is covered by the engine tests of the keyword, not by a card here.
- **Four-player games.** The scenario games cover first-player tie choices and per-player numbers at four players; no new four-player case was
  added here (the findings do not change with player count except finding 2, which needs two).
- **Atlas, Backup and the round end.** Atlas's growth counter ("after the villain phase ends") and the Backup's interrupt ("when the round ends")
  are different moments of step six; whether the heal sees Atlas before or after his new counter changes nothing except his hit point total, and no
  test orders them.
- No FFG ruling in the file names a card of these sets. Used here: December 17, 2025 - Ruling 1 and March 6, 2026 - Ruling 1 (damage prevention
  reduces damage taken, which Dogfight's "takes" follows), January 26, 2026 - Ruling 3 (dealt against taken, Runaway Nuclear Reaction and
  overkill) and January 17, 2026 - Ruling 3 (keywords act before triggered abilities, relevant to Truncheon's piercing and a tough card, covered
  by the Extreme Risk module test).

## Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Baron Zemo (aos)

Scope: the Baron Zemo scenario 50165a to 50177 (`aos/baron-zemo.ts`: the villain 50165a/b and 50166a/b, the main scheme stages 50167a/b to 50169a/b, the
encounter cards 50170 to 50177 except Reluctant Foe 50171 and Battle of Wits 50175, which are not scripted yet), the nine evidence cards 50185 to 50193
as hidden cards (`packages/content/src/data/aos/evidence.ts`, the engine's hidden piles) and how the scenario uses the Executive Board
(`aos/executive-board.ts`, audited on its own above). Data: `packages/content/src/data/aos/`. Every script was read against the printed text in the data,
RRG 1.8, the rulings file, the box rulebook (MC50 pp. 5, 18 to 19, 22) and the owner answers of `docs/phase7-wave9.md` section 4.1 (Q1, Q11, Q28, Q30 and
the others the module header names; none reopened). Regression tests: `packages/cards/src/wave9/aos/baron-zemo-rulings.qa.test.ts` (47 tests; both findings below are fixed, so none is an `it.fails`). `baron-zemo.test.ts`, `baron-zemo-encounter.test.ts`
and the scenario game cover the frame, every script and one play-through; this file holds only interactions they do not assert: hidden information, who
decides with two to four players, wrong-guess edges, Zemo's reset against overkill and a tough card, status cards and steady across the flip, the
interrupt on card-made activations, Vulnerable and Hinder on the encounter cards, Undermine Support's per-support cost, Divided Loyalties on a stunned
or confused ally, and options with no target.

| Zemo 1: 50177 The Ends Justify the Means (options with no valid target) | RRG "Choose (Option)" p. 12: "When an encounter card requires a player to choose an option, they cannot choose an option that requires one or more targets if there are no valid targets for that option." RRG "Target" p. 42 lists "a minion", "an ally" and "a card" as targets. So with no minion in play the first option ("Baron Zemo defeats the minion with the fewest remaining hit points. Baron Zemo schemes.") is not offered, and with no ally or support you control the second ("Discard an ally or support you control") is not. | Both options are always offered. With no minion in play, choosing the first only makes Zemo scheme. With no ally or support, choosing the second costs nothing and does nothing: the minion is not defeated and Zemo does not scheme, so the player skips the whole card for free (an exploit, not only a display issue). **Fixed** in the script (a `when:` on each option); the test now asserts the expected behavior. | Script, one line each: `{ when: exists(query("minion")) }` on the first `option(...)` and `{ when: exists(query(["ally", "support"], { controller: "you" })) }` on the second (the DSL `option` takes `when:`). Pinned by two `it.fails` and two companions.          |
| Zemo 2: 50170 Baron Zemo's Sword, Hero Action with no counter to remove | "Spend ... -> remove 1 secret counter from a Board Member environment and discard this card." RRG "Target" p. 42: an ability that requires a target "can only be initiated if it has at least one valid target", and a target is valid "if any part of that ability can affect that target": an environment with no secret counter cannot have one removed. With all three environments at 0 the action cannot be initiated and nothing is spent (RRG "Cost" p. 13 pays a cost only for an ability that is initiated).                          | The action is used: three energy resources are spent, no counter is removed (none to remove) and the Sword is discarded anyway. A player can spend a hand to get rid of the Sword's Forced Response without paying its price (a counter). **Fixed** in the script (a `when:` on each option); the test now asserts the expected behavior.                                                                                 | Probably script, one line: a `when:` on each `swordPayment` option (an environment holds a secret counter). If the engine still offers a Hero Action whose only choice list is empty, that is a small engine check instead. Pinned by one `it.fails` and a companion. |

Each finding is pinned: `it.fails` for the expected behavior and a passing test for today's. When one is fixed, flip its `it.fails` to `it` and delete
its companion. Zemo 1 is the stronger of the two (the RRG sentence is explicit and the second direction is an exploit).

### Checked, no findings

- **Hidden information (MC50 p. 5 "without looking at them", p. 19; `docs/phase7-wave9.md` 3.29).** From the opening log through the Response and the
  accusation prompt: the log (`hiddenPilesDealt`) names sizes only; `sealHiddenPiles` plus the card pool names no card of either pile; the prompt
  crosses out the gained cards and nothing else; the only events that carry evidence ids before the accusation name the gained cards; the A.I.M. pile
  turns faceup after `accusationMade` and before `moleIdentified`, in that order; `preview()` of the answer to the accuse prompt stops at
  "hiddenInformation" with no outcome and no A.I.M. card in it. A gain never draws an A.I.M. card (seeds 1 to 3), so the mole's own row is never crossed
  out. With all six S.H.I.E.L.D. cards gained only the mole's row is left, nobody is asked and the accusation is correct (elimination, MC50 p. 18).
- **Who decides (RRG "First Player" p. 19; MC50 p. 19).** The Response, the advance and the accusation are asked of the first player only, and with the
  token on the second player they are asked of the second player. The Response comes after the last turn ends (and after the end-of-phase discard, draw
  and ready steps), not after the first, and before any villain activation. A gain and the advance in one use cross the gained cards out in that
  accusation.
- **Per-player values (card 50167a, 50169a/b).** At four players: 8 starting threat, 4 x 2 threat from a correct accusation, 72 hit points on the Unmasked
  face. Zemo's Unmasked interrupt is asked of each player he activates against, in order (two players).
- **Wrong guesses against the flip threshold (MC50 p. 19; 50168b steps 2 and 3).** From the opening 2 counters on each environment, two wrong guesses
  put every member at 4 and the players lose in a standard game; one wrong guess does the same in expert (3). A correct expert accusation loses
  nothing and the Unmasked face is the steady 50166b. A wrong accused member that had already joined Zemo takes the per-guess counters and the 3 more on
  its attachment, the mole (an environment) flips at 3B keeping its counters, and the threat is 1[per_hero] per counter on every attachment. A joined
  Surveillance Aid answers each placing during The Accusation with 2 threat on the main scheme; that threat on a stage with no threat meter neither
  completes it nor carries to Fighting Zemo (stage 3's own count ends the game in that staging, 13 against 12).
- **Zemo's reset (50165a / 50166a; MC50 p. 22 FAQ).** The damage past his hit points is not kept (Haymaker for 3 at 1 left leaves 12 whole); a tough
  status card prevents the damage so there is no reset and no counter is removed (RRG "Tough" p. 44); overkill from a defeated minion is damage to the
  villain and resets him, after the minion's own defeat interrupt (RRG "Overkill" p. 31; the M.O.D.O.K. FAQ's order); the reset removes counters from
  environments only (a joined member keeps its counters); he is not "defeated" for other cards (FAQ). The Unmasked face has no reset: lethal damage
  wins (MC50 p. 19).
- **Status cards on both faces (RRG "Stun" p. 41, "Confuse" p. 13, "Steady" p. 41, "Flip" p. 20; MC50 p. 22 Nick Fury FAQ).** A stun on the masked face
  survives the flip (same card type), cancels his first Unmasked attack, and no "activates against you" interrupt is offered (he did not activate).
  Expert: one stunned card on the steady face is not a stun (he attacks, the interrupt is offered, the card stays); two are, and both go at once. A
  confused Zemo in alter-ego form discards the card instead of scheming and offers no interrupt (the unconfused control offers it); in hero form a
  confused Zemo still attacks and keeps the card.
- **The interrupt on card-made activations (RRG "Activation" p. 6; owner Q67 of wave 5).** Might Makes Right (hero) after the accusation: Zemo's
  interrupt is offered for the villain phase's activation and again for the card's attack. (Zemo's own interrupt also answers a revealed Advance,
  which makes him scheme.)
- **Where Zemo's counters go.** One counter on the mole's Surveillance Aid is one placing (2 threat); the expert 2 counters are also one placing (2
  threat, not 4). "The Board Member environment with the fewest" ignores an attachment that holds fewer (S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent after the mole joined).
- **Encounter-card keywords.** A stunned Agent is discarded without being defeated (Vulnerable, RRG p. 48), so its defeat interrupt places nothing.
  Divided Loyalties and Undermine Support enter with 3 + 1[per_hero] threat from Hinder (5 at two players; RRG "Hinder X" p. 22).
- **Undermine Support (RRG "Ready" p. 36).** The cost is per support: one resource readies one of two supports, paying for both readies both, and an
  exhausted ally readies for free.
- **Divided Loyalties on a stunned or confused ally (RRG "Stun" p. 41, "Confuse" p. 13).** A stunned ally's attack and a confused ally's thwart still
  cost the extra resource (the RRG says costs of the attempt are still paid): the status card goes, the ally exhausts, nothing is damaged or thwarted.
  Unpaid, the stunned attack is refused and the stun stays.
- **3A's find (RRG "Find" p. 19).** The Sword is found from the encounter discard pile, and a Sword already on Zemo stays attached once and is not
  discarded.
- **1B with one card left.** The 2 counters are placed and the one card is gained (the engine gains "as many as are left", `docs/phase7-wave9.md` 3.29;
  Q30 decides only the empty pile).

### Read against the card text, not covered by a new test

Script reads correct against the printed text, and the module tests and scenario game assert them: the setup deal (one card of each kind in the A.I.M.
pile, the other six in the S.H.I.E.L.D. pile), 2 counters on each environment, standard on 50165 and expert on 50166, the reset to 12 and 16 with the
first player splitting the 3 removals (Q28), the Unmasked interrupt's two options and the counter amounts, the stage 3 flip and hit point reset (18 per
hero), the Sword's find, S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent's two triggers and tie, Undermine Support and Divided Loyalties' constants and When Defeated, Might Makes
Right in both forms, The Ends Justify the Means' two options with their tie and split, and the Sword's Forced Response and cost choice (the known notes
excepted).

### Source conflicts (flagged, not picked)

- **"An incorrect accusation does not result in a loss" (MC50 p. 5 and the Strategy Note on p. 19) against the arithmetic.** The cards give each
  environment 2 counters at setup, a wrong guess adds 1 counter to every member, a member joins at 4 (3 in expert), and three joined members lose the
  game (50181b to 50183b). From the opening state two wrong guesses lose a standard game and one wrong guess loses an expert game. The rulebook's
  sentence reads as a generalization (counters removed first), so the engine follows the cards; worth an official clarification.
- **Forced Response or Forced Interrupt for the reset (MC50 p. 18 against the printed cards and MC50 p. 4).** Already decided in
  `docs/phase7-wave9.md` section 1: the printed card wins. No change here.
- **Secret counters on the flip.** RRG "Flip" p. 20 against MC50 pp. 6, 11 and 19 and owner Q1 = A; already decided (the Thunderbolts section).

### Thin coverage and open points

- **Reluctant Foe 50171 and Battle of Wits 50175** are not scripted and not tested. The Battle of Wits "prevent X" hook is the engine agent's.
- **Several simultaneous damage sources on Zemo** (Spray Fire with a guard minion, Q16, plus an overkill spill, Q31's replaced defeat): only the
  overkill spill was staged. Whether the reset runs once when two sources would each defeat him in one resolution is not tested.
- **Hidden information was checked on the engine's own surfaces** (events, sealed state, hidden-pile views, the prompt, `preview`). The client's view
  models and a multiplayer wire copy are not exercised here; the netcode agent's sealed-state work is the place.
- **Four players:** only the per-player values of a correct accusation were staged. A wrong accusation at three or four players (which member the first
  player lets join, the Forced Responses of several Aids in one placing) is not.
- **The accuse choice with one row left** asks nobody (engine, `resolve/accusation.ts`). The result is forced, so no rule is broken; a client should show
  it instead of skipping silently.
- **1B with one card left** follows the engine spec, not a ruling: the printed "gain 2 cards" and Q30's "may not be placed for nothing" leave "placed
  for one card" unanswered. It is pinned as built; the owner may want it recorded in section 4.1.
- **Heroes in alter-ego form during the Unmasked stage** were staged only for a confused Zemo. Stunned Zemo against an alter-ego player is a scheme,
  which a stun does not cancel; not tested.
- **Expert campaign and campaign-only branches** (1 card gained, no setup counters, the heal bullet) are the campaign pass's and are not scripted.

## Techno, Whiteout and Strength in Diversity (falcon, winter)

Scope: the Techno set (Falcon, `falcon/techno.ts`: Fixer 53038, Jet Pack 53039, Tech-Pac 53040, Technological Innovation 53041, Techno 53042), the Whiteout
set (Winter Soldier, `winter/whiteout.ts`: Blizzard 54034, Encased in Ice 54035, Slippery Conditions 54036, Whiteout 54037) and Strength in Diversity 53019
(`falcon/aspect-basic.ts`). Data: `packages/content/src/data/{falcon,winter}/cards.ts`. Every script was read against the printed text in the data, RRG
1.8, the rulings file, the box rulebook (MC50 p. 15, where the Thunderbolts scenario uses both sets) and the owner decisions of `docs/phase7-wave9.md`
sections 3.48 to 3.50 and 4.1 (none reopened; section 4.1 has no question on these cards, so the engine agent's flagged defaults are the decisions
under test). Regression tests: `packages/cards/src/wave9/falcon/techno-whiteout-rulings.qa.test.ts` (42 tests; 1 `it.fails` pinning the one finding below,
with a passing companion that pins today's behavior). `techno.test.ts`, `whiteout.test.ts`, `aspect-basic.test.ts` and
`thunderbolts-new-sets-scenario.test.ts` cover every script and a play-through of each set; this file holds only interactions they do not assert: Fixer
held by Thunderbolt Backup and after the swap, Fixer defeated with attachments, two redirected reveals, Jet Pack against overkill and small hits, Tech-Pac's
cost with statuses and with two players, Encased in Ice with two players and against stun, tough, retaliate, a leaving ally, "after you attack", attack
events and divided damage, a host with two copies, Blizzard when the ally dies, Whiteout's boost with a defender, Slippery Conditions with an effect-made
ally, and Strength in Diversity with Alliance and a tough enemy.

| Whiteout 1: 54035 Encased in Ice, two copies on one character | Card text: "Attached character cannot attack enemies other than this card." Each copy forbids attacks on enemies other than itself. RRG "Enemy" p. 18: "An enemy is a minion or villain"; the other copy is an attachment that is only attackable "as if it were a minion", so it is not an enemy and neither copy forbids attacking the other. The host can attack and break either copy (Blizzard's set holds two copies and he attacks every round, so two on one hero is ordinary). Intent (Q50): the ice is meant to be breakable by its host. | The host with two copies can attack neither (nor Rhino): `attackForbidden` (`select.ts`) reads the target with `choosingAttackTarget`, so the other copy counts as an enemy to each copy's prohibition. Only other players can break them. Pinned by one `it.fails` and a companion. | Small engine change, or a script change if the query can name an exclusion: the "cannot attack enemies other than this card" prohibition (not "cannot attack minions" rules such as Drax's) should read its target without the "as a minion" category, or the card's `target` query should also exclude a card named Encased in Ice (`54035.encased-in-ice-constant`). Not a one-word edit unless the query has a name exclusion. |

Only the one finding is pinned. Whiteout 1 is a strong finding on intent and on the RRG definition of "enemy"; the contrary reading (as if it were a minion
extends to the prohibition) produces a deadlock that no reading of the card's purpose wants.

### Checked, no findings

- **Fixer's redirect with two Tech attachments in one phase (RRG "Attach To" p. 8).** Energy Truncheon (first player) and High-Tech Armament (second
  player) both end on Fixer and Rhino keeps nothing. Tech-Pac counts a redirected attachment from the next activation (1 + 1 before, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 after,
  with the Truncheon's own +1 ATK).
- **Fixer defeated with attachments (RRG "Attach To" p. 8, "Victory X" p. 46).** Jet Pack, Tech-Pac and a redirected Energy Truncheon go to the encounter
  discard pile with him, Fixer goes to the victory display, and nothing moves on to the villain.
- **Only "would be attached".** A Tech attachment already on the villain stays there when Fixer arrives later. With Fixer engaged, a Tech attachment bound
  for the villain (Armament) goes to him.
- **Fixer held by Thunderbolt Backup (MC50 p. 15; Q26 = B).** A held Fixer is in play, so his Forced Interrupt is live: an Armament bound for Citizen V goes to
  him, not to the villain. Techno revealed while he is held finds him in play: he leaves the environment, engages the revealer and attacks. After the
  end-of-round swap he keeps Jet Pack and Tech-Pac and their effects (Aerial, +ATK) while held, and the next Tech reveal still goes to him.
- **A redirected reveal is one entering play (RRG "Enters Play" p. 18).** One reveal, one move onto Fixer, one `cardEntersPlay`, and no "an ability attached
  it" announcement (`cardAttached` without `imminent`) for the new host. See the open point on the second reading.
- **Jet Pack (RRG "Prevent" p. 35, "Overkill" p. 31; ruling January 26, 2026 - Ruling 3).** Relentless Assault (5, overkill) at a Fixer with one hit point
  left: all 5 is prevented, Jet Pack is discarded, Fixer survives and the villain takes nothing; without Jet Pack the same attack defeats Fixer and 4 excess
  goes to the villain. Two 2-damage attacks are both taken (the interrupt reads one instance, not a total) and a later 3-damage attack is prevented.
- **Tech-Pac's cost.** A stunned and confused identity still pays (the statuses only replace attacks and thwarts, RRG "Stun" p. 41, "Confuse" p. 13) and keeps
  both status cards. With two players the first player cannot exhaust the second player's identity or ally, and cannot reach 3 with their own two; the
  second player may use the Hero Action with their own Captain Marvel and Mockingbird (2 + 1 > 2) and the first player's characters stay ready (December
  17, 2025 - Ruling 1: any player can trigger an Action ability on an encounter card).
- **Technological Innovation counts any card type (default confirmed).** Arc Reactor (first player) and Web-Shooter (second player), two Tech upgrades, plus
  the Jet Pack it just revealed: 4 + 3 = 7. Arc Reactor in a hand is not in play (4 + 1). A redirected Jet Pack on Fixer counts; Fixer himself (not Tech) does not.
- **Encased in Ice with two players (RRG "Move" p. 30).** The second player's hero breaks the first player's ice: the surplus is moved to the first player
  (the host), not to the attacker. Each encased identity attacks only its own copy. The first player's Mockingbird attacking the second player's ice puts her
  ATK on the card and she takes her own consequential damage (RRG "Consequential Damage" p. 13: the ally's own icons, whatever it attacked).
- **Encased in Ice against host states.** A stunned encased hero attacking the ice discards the stun, exhausts and puts nothing on the ice (RRG "Stun" p. 41).
  A tough host absorbs the moved surplus (moved damage "is considered to be dealt", RRG "Move" p. 30; "Tough" p. 44). An attack on the ice of a Retaliate host
  (Black Panther) does not retaliate, and neither does the moved surplus. An encased ally defeated as a defender takes the ice and its damage to the
  encounter discard pile; nothing reaches the hero (RRG "Attach To" p. 8).
- **Encased in Ice against attack events.** Spray Fire (50039, a group-named attack) from an unencased player hits the villain and not another player's
  ice; from an encased hero it deals nothing (the card names no target but enemies other than the ice). Wasp Sting's Giant ability divides its 4 among the
  villain and the minion only: the ice is not offered (see open point).
- **Blizzard when the ally dies (RRG "Otherwise" p. 31, "Search" p. 39).** The defending ally is defeated: nothing is encased, nobody is stunned, the copies
  searched for in the discard pile are still in the discard pile ("cards being searched are not considered to leave the searched area"), and the deck was
  shuffled. Two players: Blizzard engaged with the first player encases only the first player.
- **Whiteout's boost.** "You are stunned" stuns the identity of the player the activation is against, not the defending ally; with two players the boost on
  the activation against the second player stuns only the second player.
- **Slippery Conditions (RRG "Enters Play" p. 18).** An ally put into play by an effect (Make the Call from the discard pile) enters exhausted, and ready
  without the scheme. An ally the second player plays is exhausted too.
- **Strength in Diversity (RRG "Alliance" p. 6, "Tough" p. 44).** At two players the second player pays half of the 2-per-player cost from their hand, all
  three choices (Aerial, Avenger, Soldier) are the first player's, and 3 damage is dealt. With Falcon alone against a tough enemy the first damage discards the
  tough card and the second is dealt. The alter-ego identity's traits count is confirmed by `aspect-basic.test.ts` (a second player in alter-ego form adds
  Genius, in hero form adds nothing new) and by RRG "Traits" p. 45: both forms are characters in play.

### Verdict on the defaults the engine agent flagged

| Fixer: "attached to the villain" means any villain                            | Supported. The card says "the villain" with no "main" or "current"; held in play (MC50 p. 15) and with Citizen V as the villain. No source limits it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| A redirected reveal is the card entering play, not an "after you attach"      | Consistent with the engine's own reading of RRG "Attach To" p. 8 (last bullet) and "Enters Play" p. 18, but not decided by a source: the bullet could also be read as "another ability causes the attach, so it is an attach". No printed card can tell the readings apart yet (every "after you attach" names a player and Fixer's ability has none). Open, see below.          |
| "Each Tech card in play" counts any card type with the trait                  | Supported: the card says "Tech card" (the search clause above it says "Tech attachment"), RRG "Traits" p. 45 limits nothing; the test counts upgrades of two players.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| An encased character cannot attack another character's copy                   | Supported by the card text ("this card") and already asserted by `whiteout.test.ts`. The two-copies case on one character is the finding above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| "After you attack an enemy/minion" responses do not hear an attack on the ice | Neither reading is decided by a source. Against: RRG "Enemy" p. 18 (a minion or villain), "Attack (Player Ability Type)" p. 10 ("an enemy that can be attacked"), and "as if it were a minion" sits in the targeting sentence. For: "as if it were a minion" has no stated limit and could carry through the attack procedure. No ruling names the card or phrase. Open (owner). |
| Divided damage does not offer the ice                                         | Same: consistent with the RRG definition of "enemy", but each recipient of divided damage is also an attack's target (p. 10), where "as if it were a minion" applies. No ruling. Open (owner). Pinned with Wasp Sting.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Blizzard shuffles whether or not a copy was found                             | Supported: RRG "Search" p. 39 shuffles the deck once any portion has been searched; checked with a copy attached, none left and the ally dead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| No stun when a copy was found but could not be attached                       | Consistent but not decidable in play. RRG "Otherwise" p. 31 would let the second sentence resolve (an effect that "cannot at least partially resolve"), but the only way to find a copy and not attach it is a defender that left play, which cannot be stunned. No observable difference; the test pins the defeated ally.                                                      |
| Strength in Diversity: an alter-ego identity's traits count                   | Supported (RRG "Traits" p. 45; an identity in either form is a character in play); covered by `aspect-basic.test.ts` and not repeated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Source conflicts (flagged, not picked)

- **"As if it were a minion" for "after you attack an enemy" and for divided damage.** See the two rows above: RRG "Enemy" p. 18 and "Attack (Player Ability
  Type)" p. 10 point one way, the unqualified "as if it were a minion" can point the other. No ruling in `docs/rulings/marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md` names Encased
  in Ice or the phrase (the nearest, December 17, 2025 - Ruling 1 question 3 on Beguiled, is about an ally becoming a minion by a status change).
- **Fixer's redirect and RRG "Attach To" p. 8.** The last bullet keeps "attach to" and "another ability causes the attach" apart; it does not say whether the
  second is an attach for a response. The engine does not announce it as one.
- **Blizzard's "Otherwise" and the owner default** (above): the RRG reads one way, the observable result is the same.

### Read against the card text, not covered by a new test

Script reads correct against the printed text, and the module tests and the scenario games assert them: Fixer's interrupt and its `villainAlias`, Jet Pack's
Aerial and 3-damage prevention, Tech-Pac's +1 ATK per other Tech attachment and its combined-THW cost, Technological Innovation's search, shuffle and threat,
Techno's find, activation, surge and piercing boost, Blizzard's response on the hero and on a defending ally, Encased in Ice's target restriction, state
check (3 or more, all but 3 moved) and "discarded, not defeated", Slippery Conditions' exhaust, Whiteout's find and boost, and Strength in Diversity's
choices per trait.

### Thin coverage and open points

- **Tough and Jet Pack on the same 3 damage.** Both are "would take damage" interrupts; the tough card answers first today and Jet Pack stays. The RRG orders
  simultaneous effects by the first player (p. 19) and no ruling decides it. Pinned, not a finding.
- **Piercing and indirect damage against Jet Pack** were not staged: no player card gives a hero's attack piercing in this pool, and indirect damage is dealt to
  players' characters (RRG "Indirect Damage" p. 24), never to an enemy.
- **Team-Up ally with Slippery Conditions.** No ally in the data prints Team-Up (only events and upgrades do), and RRG "Team-Up" p. 43 is a deckbuilding and
  play restriction, so an ally enters play like any other. Not staged.
- **A stunned, encased hero attacking something other than the ice** was not staged (the stun lets the attempt be made with no valid target, RRG "Stun"
  p. 41; whether the attempt may name Rhino against Encased in Ice's prohibition is unanswered).
- **"Choose an enemy" attack events** that choose several enemies one at a time (the Winter Soldier event that chooses an enemy per exhausted Weapon upgrade, Hulk's three-enemy Hero Action) were not staged;
  whether the ice is offered in each choice follows the same open reading as "after you attack".
- **Staging notes for the next author.** A search shuffles the encounter deck, so a card stacked behind a find may be dealt: keep the copies searched for in the
  discard pile and the deck long (an emptied deck reshuffles its discard pile into it). Core's Assault 01187 makes the villain attack in hero form; the file's
  filler is Advance 01186, with a dozen extra copies added to the table's deck.
- **Four players:** only the two-player cases above were staged.

## Trickster Takeover (tt)

Scope: 55001 to 55066 (scripts in `packages/cards/src/wave9/tt/`: `enchantress.ts`, `trickster-magic.ts`, `god-of-lies.ts`, `aspect-basic.ts`; data in
`packages/content/src/data/tt/cards.ts`). Every script was read against the printed text in the data (all 66 cards) and the MC55 insert
(`docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc55_trickster_takeover.md`, pp. 2 to 7, 9 to 23). The rulings file was searched for every tt title and for Loki, Enchantress,
Hypnotic Gaze, Spellbound, Figment, Avatar, Synergy, Shatter, Linked and Zzzax. The rulings that name the pack are February 28, 2026 - Ruling 3 (Shatter and
Permanent Focus), February 28, 2026 - Ruling 4 (2) (Quickstrike before When Revealed), February 28, 2026 - Ruling 5 (Spell Blast), March 19, 2026 - Ruling 2
(Whirlwind against Enchantress), June 25, 2026 - Ruling 5 (Dark Scepter) and August 3, 2026 - Ruling 4 (3) (linked cards in decks); each is asserted by the
module tests except March 19, 2026 - Ruling 2, which had no test and is in the new file. Regression tests: `packages/cards/src/wave9/tt/rulings.qa.test.ts`
(20 tests and 2 `it.todo`, no `it.fails`: no script or engine bug was found). The module tests are thorough (per-card tests plus the scenario games); the
new file holds only interactions they do not assert.

### Findings

None in the scripts or the engine. Two test-quality notes for the owners of the module tests (not game bugs):

| Where                                                                               | What                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enchantress-encounter.test.ts`, Spell Shards "damage assigned entirely to an ally" | The title says the identity took none and no counter is placed, but the body assigns 3 damage to a 2-hit-point ally, so the identity takes 1 and the counter is placed. The "took none, so no counter" half is not asserted there; `rulings.qa.test.ts` asserts it with a tough identity. |
| Stale header comments                                                               | `enchantress-encounter.test.ts` still says "Trickster Magic is unscripted", and `god-of-lies.test.ts` says every game replaces the encounter deck so no Trickster Magic card is revealed; both modules are scripted now. No effect on the tests.                                          |

### Checked, with a test in `rulings.qa.test.ts`

- **Whirlwind (ally) cannot basic attack Enchantress while Future of Despair is in play (ruling March 19, 2026 - Ruling 2; RRG "Target" p. 42).** Legal
  before the Future of Despair; refused after stage I falls (and the identity's basic attack is refused as well); the main scheme loses no threat.
- **Ulik's Forced Response hears an ally's damage (MC55 card 55020; RRG "Ownership and Control" p. 31).** Player 2's Titania ally damages Enchantress and Ulik,
  engaged with player 1, attacks player 2.
- **Seduced affects its own player only (card 55015; RRG "You, Your" p. 49).** Player 2 may still basic attack and play an Attack event; player 1's is refused,
  and allowed again with the card removed (the control).
- **Zzzax 55059 and the Zzzax ally 55066 count printed [energy] resources only (RRG "Wild Resource" p. 48).** A printed wild icon (Spider-Woman, Hellcat) is
  no indirect damage and the ally's search does not find a wild-only card; the Energy resource card prints two energy icons and counts twice.
- **Whirlwind 55058 (minion): Quickstrike then the Forced Response (RRG "Quickstrike" p. 36; ruling February 28, 2026 - Ruling 4 (2)).** Revealed, he engages and
  attacks once at once, and the Forced Response deals exactly 1 more indirect damage per side scheme in play.
- **Crown of the Enchantress stays on Enchantress when stage I is replaced by stage II (RRG "Villain Defeat" p. 47: attachments carry over).**
- **Spellbound 55022, a Defiant player at 4 counters.** The first sentence's fifth counter flips the Gaze and the second sentence then finds the player
  Enthralled: the player discards a card they control. Pinned as built; see question 1.
- **Law of Attraction 55021 finds a Trickster Magic minion (they print ENTHRALLED, MC55 p. 5).** Titania is discarded, revealed and engages the player.
- **Puppet Master 55061, two heroes, expert (MC55 p. 2 "Hinder X").** Enters with 2 + 2 threat; standard stays at 2.
- **Toughness on Enchantress II (RRG "Toughness" p. 45; ruling April 30, 2026 - Ruling 3 (2)).** The expert game begins with one tough status card on her;
  standard stage I has none.
- **Whirlwind (ally) in the God of Lies scenario (MC55 p. 18; card 55028a).** "Each scheme in play" removes threat from Mischief and Mayhem but never from the
  neutral Worlds Collide, and the +1 ATK counts only the threat actually removed.
- **Feigned Retreat 55053 against Mischief and Mayhem 1B's replaced defeat (RRG "Prevent" p. 35).** With a synergy counter the hit that would defeat the
  identity is prevented: no form change and no threat on Worlds Collide. Without one (the control) the identity changes to alter-ego and Worlds Collide gets 1.
- **Owner question 58 = A (RRG "Linked" p. 27; MC55 p. 2).** She-Hulk's nemesis Titania (Core 01162) does not set the Titania ally aside; Trickster Magic in the
  game sets it aside once.
- **Forced Actions (MC55 p. 7).** An owed Love Concoction blocks End Turn; once exhausted by another effect, or discarded by its own Alter-Ego Action, the
  player is free to end the phase.
- **Spell Shards 55026 on a tough identity (RRG "Indirect Damage" p. 24; ruling January 17, 2026 - Ruling 3 (1)).** All 3 assigned to the identity are prevented
  by the tough card, which is spent, and no charm counter is placed (the damage was dealt, not taken).
- **Sindr 55019, Defiant, alter-ego form.** He schemes (no attack, no indirect damage).

### Rules questions

Both are built as A today; no source decides them.

| #   | Question                                                                                                                                                        | A (built today)                                                                                                                           | B                                                                                             | Sources                                                                                                        |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Spellbound 55022 defeated, a Defiant player at 4 counters: the first sentence's counter flips the Gaze. Does that player also discard a card (second sentence)? | Yes: the sentences resolve in order, the flip is immediate, and the second sentence reads the trait afterward                             | No: both sentences read each player's trait before either resolves                            | Card 55022; RRG "Resolving abilities"; ruling February 28, 2026 - Ruling 5 (1) (a choosing sentence, not this) |
| 2   | Toughness on a new villain stage: Enchantress II, revealed when stage I is defeated in standard mode, gets a tough status card. Right?                          | Yes: the stage that replaces a defeated one enters play and gets it (the expert opening is certain, ruling April 30, 2026 - Ruling 3 (2)) | No: the villain keeps the status cards it had; toughness applies only when a card enters play | RRG "Toughness" p. 45, "Villain Defeat" p. 47; cards 55002, 55003                                              |

### Source conflicts

None found between the RRG and a ruling for this pack. The script comments that cite the rulings (Ulik's "dealt" damage under Future of Despair, from
ruling January 17, 2026 - Ruling 3 (1); the Whirlwind and Future of Despair ruling) agree with them.

### Thin coverage and open points

- **Ulik 55020 under Future of Despair (`it.todo`).** The script counts damage "dealt" even when Enchantress cannot take damage. Every damaging effect in
  the harness targets her, and ruling March 19, 2026 - Ruling 2 makes her an invalid target, so no path to observe it was found.
- **Epic Multiplayer Mode (`it.todo`).** The per-group icon, pods, the Mangog and Door Between Worlds across groups (MC55 pp. 11 to 17) are not testable: the
  engine plays Single Group Mode only. Not audited.
- **Guard and Patrol keywords on Absorbing Man 55056 and Fenris Wolf 55042, Steady on Titania 55057, Hinder, Incite, Stalwart**: data keywords; their engine
  behavior is covered by the engine's keyword tests and the per-card tests, not re-staged.
- **Four players** and the **expert-mode** cards of the God of Lies encounter set were not re-staged beyond the module tests; the Avatar swap, the Shatter
  steps and the owner decisions Q8 to Q10 are asserted in `god-of-lies.test.ts` and `god-of-lies.game.test.ts` and were not repeated.
- **Cross-pack (by reading, not staged):** Malekith 55039's "deal it to yourself as a facedown encounter card" is a named-card deal, the case the Falcon section's
  Medium finding says the engine does not announce to Aerial Recon's interrupt.
