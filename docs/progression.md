# Progression: unlocks and champion points

**This is a feature of this client, not of Marvel Champions.** Unlocks and champion points are not in the Rules
Reference, the FAQ or any product insert, and they never change how a game plays. Every scenario and hero plays
exactly as printed, whether the player earned it or switched it on. The rules engine (`@mc/engine`) never sees any
of this: progression lives entirely in `@mc/client` (`packages/client/src/progression/`), and it only decides which
precons, scenarios and campaigns the setup screens offer.

The same explanation is in the game, in **Settings ▸ Unlocks ▸ How it works** (`view/progression-guide.ts`). That
screen is built from the constants below, and `progression-guide.test.ts` fails if this document's numbers drift from
them.

## What's always open

- **The Core Set:** all five heroes and all three villains, from the first launch. It has no switch.
- **The player's own decks:** a deck imported from MarvelCDB or built in the deck builder seats whatever hero it's
  for (`Unlocks.deckLock`). Only preconstructed decks are locked, so play unlocks a precon, not the character.

## The unlock path

Content is gated by release wave (`Cycle.id`), in release order (`UNLOCK_WAVES` in `progression/unlocks.ts`). A win
counts at any difficulty, whether it came in a campaign or on its own. An open wave opens its scenarios and its
campaign box; the box's own cast joins at once, and every other hero's precon is the reward for one villain.

| Wave                     | Opens when                                   | Heroes                                                                                                                                                                       |

Fear No Evil (MC60) opens after the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. campaign too, since Civil War has no campaign to gate it (owner, 2026-10-19: option A, the same gate as Civil War). Jessica Jones and Luke Cage open with it too (owner, 2026-10-20: the Fear No Evil heroes unlock when the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. campaign is won).

Civil War (MC56) opens after the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. campaign (owner, question 25 = A) and has no campaign of its own
(MC56 p. 3). Its four leader scenarios (Iron Man, Captain Marvel, Captain America, Spider-Woman) open with the box. The
Wonder Man and Hercules, the cycle's two hero-pack heroes, unlock by beating its leaders (owner, question 25A): Wonder Man
for Registration Iron Man and Hercules for Resistance Captain America. Both packs are in the pool with a starter deck
(`wonder-man-justice`, `hercules-leadership`), which is what `UNLOCK_HEROES` is built from. Captain Marvel and
Spider-Woman pay no hero. Hercules' nemesis set and the All Versus All modular set come with his pack.

Trickster Takeover (Enchantress; Loki, God of Lies; the Trickster Magic modular set) has no row of its own: it
opens with the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. wave. The pack prints no unlock requirement, so this is a progression policy
choice, not a rule (owner, 2026-10-11).

On the Saga shelf a campaign still follows the shelf's own order (win a volume on Standard to open the next) unless
it was opened by hand. Adding a wave to the app's pool means adding its row to `UNLOCK_WAVES`: `unlocks.test.ts`
fails until every pool wave and every pool hero has a place on the path.

## Champion points

Champion points are a score that makes playing for something worth more than switching it on.

### Earning

Only firsts count, so replaying a villain already beaten earns nothing more.

| Achievement                                      | Points |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| First win against a scenario (any difficulty)    | 100    |
| First Expert (or Extreme) win against a scenario | +50    |
| Completing a campaign                            | 500    |
| Completing it as an Expert Campaign              | +250   |

Earned points are never stored. They're derived from the same rows the results history and the Saga shelf read:
`won` saves in `mc-saves` and `won` campaign records in `mc-campaigns` (`progressOf`, `Unlocks.points`).

### Unlocking by hand

A player can unlock something right where they find it locked, or in Settings ▸ Unlocks:

- **Seats:** tapping a locked precon offers to unlock it, then seats it.
- **Scenario select:** a locked scenario's button reads "Unlock · 100 pts".
- **Saga shelf:** a sealed campaign this build can play reads "Unlock · 300 pts", and opens out of the shelf's order.
- **Settings ▸ Unlocks:** a switch for everything, each campaign, each scenario and each hero.

Every one of them goes through the same confirm (`scenes/unlock-confirm.ts`).

| Unlocked by hand  | Cost                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| One hero's precon | 150                          |
| One scenario      | 100                          |
| One campaign      | 300 (its cast comes with it) |

- Points are spent, never borrowed: an unlock the player can't afford is refused (`Unlocks.canAfford`, and
  `unlockByHand` leaves the preferences unchanged), so the total never goes below zero. The confirm says how many
  more points are needed and names the free way in.
- Anything that costs points asks first. The confirm popup gives the cost, says it isn't refunded, and names the
  villain that would unlock it for free.
- Anything already earned by play is free, and so is anything already paid for once.
- Each thing is charged once and never refunded. Switching it off and on again doesn't charge twice.
- The Unlocks header lists where every earned point came from ("First win: Rhino (+100)"), and says "No points yet"
  until the first win.

### Unlock everything: points off

"Unlock everything" is free. It's the way out of progression altogether: every wave, hero, scenario and campaign
opens, nothing is charged, and champion points read "off" while it's on. It still asks first, since it's a manual
unlock. Switching it off goes back to earning and spending points, and anything earned meanwhile stays earned.

What was switched on, and what it cost (`UnlockPrefs.charges`), is saved in `localStorage` under `mc-unlocks`,
stamped with `UNLOCK_PREFS_VERSION`. Clearing the app's saved data resets it; earned points survive in IndexedDB.
Version 2 made "Unlock everything" free, so charges saved before it (when it cost points) are dropped on load.

### Where the player sees it

- **Settings ▸ Unlocks:** the points total, what was earned and spent, the switches, and **How it works**.
- **Settings:** the Unlocks row's summary line leads with the points total.
- **Game over:** a win shows a ribbon with the points it earned and anything it unlocked.

## Extras

**Extras** (on the Title menu, `scenes/extras.ts`) is the reward shelf: the campaign comics, the rulebooks, a file
for every hero and villain, the artwork and the soundtrack. Nothing in it is bought with points; each thing opens when the player
does what it belongs to (`progression/extras.ts`):

| Tab       | Opens when                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stories   | A campaign run reaches the issue (signing a run opens issue #1); every issue once the campaign is won                                                                                               |
| Rulebooks | Always: the Rules Reference, FFG's rulings since RRG 1.7 and every campaign box's rulebook, as plain text with links to the PDFs                                                                    |
| Heroes    | A game played as that hero ends (won, lost or conceded), in a campaign or on its own                                                                                                                |
| Villains  | A game against that scenario ends. Its "villain loses" picture opens on a win, its "villain wins" on a loss                                                                                         |
| Artwork   | The title wallpapers always; the generic victory and defeat scenes with a first win and loss; a box's cover with its first run                                                                      |
| Music     | Where the track plays: a battle theme by playing that scenario, victory and defeat themes by winning and losing it, a finale by completing the campaign. The title and default battle themes always |

A rulebook opens in the reader (`scenes/extras-reader.ts`): the repo's markdown conversion as plain text, one section
per glossary entry, page or ruling, with a search and a button per PDF. The PDFs aren't in the build (they're about
170 MB); the button opens the repo's own copy on GitHub (`content/books.ts`). A story is reread through the campaign opener with no run behind it, told to the box's own cast. A song plays through
the music controller's jukebox until another screen asks for its own music. Game over's ribbon says how many things
the game just opened ("3 new in Extras"), win or lose. Like everything else here it is derived from `mc-saves` and
`mc-campaigns`, never stored, and "Unlock everything" (or `?unlock=all`) opens all of it. `?screen=extras&tab=music`
jumps straight to a tab.

## For development

`?unlock=all` in the URL opens everything for one page load. It is never saved and never charged, and it works
alongside the `?screen=…` dev jumps.
