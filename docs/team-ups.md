# Team-Ups

Every Team-Up pair in the card data, the card that names it, and whether its pictures are in. A Team-Up card can be
played only while both named characters are in play, as an identity or an ally, under any player (RRG 1.8 "Team-Up",
p. 43), and is legal only in a deck whose identity is one of the two.

The client shows a pair's pictures when the pair is in play (added in wave 6, PR #94): the full picture once when the
team-up first happens, and the closeup in a ring on the board while it stays active; clicking the ring lists the
pair's Team-Up cards. Both come from `art/teamups/<pair>/`:

| File           | Shape                  | Shown                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `splash.<ext>` | tall, the full picture | Once, when the pair first comes together |
| `badge.<ext>`  | roughly square closeup | In the ring while the pair is in play    |

`<pair>` is the two names, each lowercased with anything but letters and digits turned into a hyphen, then sorted and
joined by a hyphen (`gambit-rogue`). A pair with no pictures shows
nothing. The list below is generated from the `teamUp` keyword in `packages/content/src/data/*/cards.ts`:

```bash
grep -rn 'name: "teamUp"' packages/content/src/data/*/cards.ts
```

A pair needs no registration of its own: the engine and the client read the `teamUp` keyword from the card data, so a
pair is playable as soon as its card is scripted and its packs are in the playable pool
(`packages/cards/src/playable/index.ts`). Wave 7 (cycle 7) made Angel and Psylocke and Cable and Deadpool playable, and
wave 8 (cycle 8) made Jubilee and Wolverine playable.

## In later packs (card data only)

Each of these goes on the "Content to add" list of the wave PR that makes its pack playable; the wave definition of
done (`wave-definition-of-done.md` §5) has the box. All five cards were read on their scans (2026-10-10): the printed
Team-Up line names both characters exactly as the `teamUp` keyword's `names` carry them.

A pending folder is never read (a leading `_` marks a holding area). When a pair's pictures are moved up they go in the
folder named in the fifth column, which is computed from the `teamUp` names (`teamUpSlug`), so the two pending folders
whose names differ (`black-panther-shuri-tchalla`, `silk-spider-man`) must be renamed on the way up, and a badge made
for each of the three splash-only pairs. Captain America and Black Widow are playable already, so both Winter Soldier
pairs wait only on `winter`.
