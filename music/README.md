# music/

The game's soundtrack. It is laid out the same way as [`art/`](../art/README.md):
the folder a track sits in says where it plays, so **adding a file to the right
folder is all it should take**. Formats: `mp3`, `ogg`, `m4a`.

> Sound effects (a punch, a card played, the "New song earned" chime) do not go
> here: every file in `music/` is a song the jukebox lists and the shuffle can
> pick. They live in [`packages/client/src/audio/sfx/`](../packages/client/src/audio/sfx/README.md),
> whose README says how to add one.

**Which track wins during a game**, most specific first:
`scenarios/<scenarioId>/battle` → `campaigns/<campaignId>/battle` →
`packs/<packCode>/battle` → `gameplay/`.

**Which track plays at Game Over**, most specific first:
`scenarios/<scenarioId>/villain-wins` (or `-loses`) → `packs/<packCode>/villain-wins` (or `-loses`) →
`outcomes/defeat` (or `victory`).

`<scenarioId>` is the content package's `Scenario.id` (`rhino`, `klaw`,
`ultron`, `risky-business`, `mutagen-formula`, `breakout`), `<campaignId>` is
`Campaign.id`, and `<packCode>` is `Pack.code` (`core`, `twc`, ...) — the same
ids `art/` uses, so a scenario's art and music folders share a name. A new
scenario needs only a new folder here.

**`scenarios/_pending/<scenarioId>/`** holds tracks for a scenario that isn't in the playable pool yet (the
scenario-id and `TRACK_TITLES` checks only accept pool scenarios). Nothing reads it; the wave that makes the
scenario playable moves the folder up to `scenarios/<scenarioId>/` and adds the `TRACK_TITLES` entry, using the
title its `soundtrack/` copy already carries. Same rule as `art/scenarios/_pending/`. **`campaigns/_pending/<campaignId>/`**
works the same way for a campaign not yet on the Saga shelf (its jukebox entry would otherwise read "Complete
<campaignId>" with no way to unlock it).

**`soundtrack/`** holds the same songs under their titles (`Nothing_Stops_the_Rhino.mp3` is
`scenarios/rhino/battle.mp3`). The client never loads it; the titles live in `TRACK_TITLES`
(`packages/client/src/progression/extras.ts`), which names every slotted track for the Extras jukebox.
`extras.test.ts` fails if a slotted track has no title or a title names no track, so a new track needs its
title added there.

**Several tracks for one slot:** add a suffix — `battle.mp3`, `battle-2.mp3`,
`battle-3.ogg` — and one is picked at random (a playlist for a long game).
Everything in `title/` and `gameplay/` is already treated that way.

The `.gitkeep` files are only there so git keeps the empty folders; leave them
or delete them once a folder has a track in it.

Keep tracks compressed (the two here are about 4 MB each): every track that
ships is carried by the desktop and mobile builds.
