 * Green Goblin (I) (02014): "Forced Response: After Green Goblin attacks and damages you, place 1 threat on the main
 * scheme." FFG Game Rules Specialist (Alex), post-RRG 1.5 rulings 225-226 (July 18, 2024, in
 * `Hall of Heroes "Latest FFG Rulings (post RRG 1.5)"`): "After X attacks and damages you" checks "if the attacked
 * player's identity was damaged as a result of the attack ... The 'you' in this ability does refer to your identity",
 * i.e. it is "After X damages you with an attack". Ruling January 11, 2026 (2) repeats the reading for the overkill
 * case. The script (`wave1/gob/mutagen-formula.ts`) is `after.villainAttacks({ againstYou, damages })`, whose `damages`
 * is the attack's total `damage` result, and that total counts damage taken by a defending ally
 * (`resolve/event.ts` `recordDamageTaken`: "The attack's `damage`/`damaged` totals count the attacked character's
 * damage"), so the response resolves when an ally absorbs the whole attack.
