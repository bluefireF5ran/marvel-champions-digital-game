/**
 * Rules audit chunk 37 (FFG rulings post-RRG 1.5, June 30 - August 10, 2023). Audit proofs only: each `it.fails`
 * marks a place the engine does something an official source forbids, and flips to a failure when it is fixed.
 *
 * FFG ruling July 13, 2023 - Ruling 48 (Alex): Restrained (Mad Titan's Shadow #83) has no "you" or "your", so "any
 * player can use the hero action to discard the card from the attached character" (also when it is attached to
 * another player's identity or ally). RRG 1.8 p. 4 (Ability): "Only the player who controls a player card with an
 * attachment that uses the word 'you' or 'your' can trigger abilities or pay costs on that attachment."
 * The engine (`actions.ts` useAbility, "only the player it is attached to can use that card") refuses every other
 * player for every encounter attachment on a player's card (RRG 1.8 p. 8 "Attachment", last bullet, read alone).
 * Findings for the same root cause: chunk-02 (flag) and chunk-22 (22.3 / 22.4, errata cards).
