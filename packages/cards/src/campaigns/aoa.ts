/**
 * Age of Apocalypse (MC45): the eighth `CampaignDefinition`, and the first whose scenarios share one block of setup
 * (`everyNodeSetup`) around a mission drawn at random.
 *
 * Source of truth: `docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc45_age_of_apocalypse.md` (cited as "MC45 p. N": the campaign rules
 * are p. 4, the mission area pp. 5-6, the five scenarios' Campaign Instructions pp. 8, 12, 14, 16 and 20, the expert
 * rules p. 20, the log sheet p. 24) and `docs/phase7-wave8.md` §2.11 to §2.16, §3.43 to §3.46 and the §4.1 decisions
 * Q20 to Q25. Every instruction carries the printed sentence it encodes; one the rulebook does not print as a bullet
 * (a record, a set-aside step) says so in its text.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MODELING
 *
 * - **The block** (MC45 pp. 8, 12, 14, 16, 20). Every scenario prints the same five Setup bullets, so they are
 *   `everyNodeSetup`, cited to their first printing (p. 8). Scenario 5 changes the second bullet ("Reveal the Protect
 *   the Professor [MISSION] side scheme"): the draw is gated on scenario 4 not being resolved and the fixed mission on
 *   its being resolved, so each attempt's trace shows one of the two as skipped.
 * - **The log's strike lists.** `missions` (the four rows of p. 24) and `overseers` (the five minions) are strike
 *   lists over printed names. `currentMission` and `currentOverseer` hold this attempt's draw; they are working
 *   fields (the sheet does not print them). A draw is `random` with `perAttempt` (§4.1 Q22 = B): a lost scenario that
 *   is retried draws both again, from everything still unstruck. Only a Victory list strikes.
 * - **Cards for the game.** Nothing of the five campaign sets is in a scenario's own sets except the four cards of
 *   Age of Apocalypse, which are composed into the encounter deck. Everything else is set aside by id for the game
 *   that needs it (`setAsideCards`, ownerless): the drawn mission's a face, the drawn Overseer, Mission Team, and the
 *   mission row's own cards. One in-game instruction then creates the mission area and puts the three into play
 *   (`missionSetup`); it names them as "the set-aside [MISSION] side scheme", "the set-aside [OVERSEER] minion" and
 *   Mission Team, of which a game has one each.
 * - **The four rows** (p. 24). Each has a Setup cell, resolved in the game the mission is drawn for, and after a win
 *   its Defeated or Not Defeated cell, which also writes the row's result field. "Was defeated" reads the game's
 *   defeat events by the mission's name (`cardsDefeated`): the card has flipped and left play by then. A mission that
 *   is neither defeated nor failed when the game is won was not defeated.
 * - **Carried rows.** Three cells last "for the rest of the campaign", so they are setup instructions of every later
 *   scenario, gated on the result field: Desperate Measures is offered to each player (a `thisGame` grant, so the
 *   card is in the shuffled deck and gone again after the game), Panicked Refugees is shuffled into each deck, North
 *   American Sea Wall into the encounter deck. Each resolves before the ally search.
 * - **Rewards** (an upgrade, a support, a campaign ally) are `campaign` grants with `deckSize: "maximumOnly"`: a
 *   reward is not one of the 40 a deck needs and is one of the 50 it may hold (owner decision, 2026-10-08, §4.1 row
 *   63, which supersedes the Q25 follow-up; MC45 p. 24 prints the first half, "That card does not count against your
 *   minimum deck size", and is silent on the maximum). "Each player chooses" makes the pick required and "They may
 *   include" makes the copy optional in the deck (owner decision, row 67; `inclusion: "optional"`). The aspect picks
 *   offer every eligible card, a title the deck already holds included, and deck validation enforces the copy limit
 *   (owner decision, row 68); the campaign allies are one card each, so a pick takes it for the table
 *   (`excludeGranted`).
 * - **Rules of the game.** The Mission Rules card has no record: its bullets are scenario rules of every node
 *   (`CampaignNode.scenarioRuleSpecs`), and scenario 5 adds "Professor X cannot enter play during this game".
 * - **Scenario 3** (p. 14; §4.1 Q21 = A): the Prelate on the reverse of the drawn Overseer is removed from the game
 *   before the scenario's own setup reveals one.
 * - **Scenario 5** (p. 20): Protect the Professor defeated wins the campaign. Won with it not defeated, the campaign
 *   is lost (`endCampaign`). If the mission fails, its own text loses the game and the scenario is retried.
 * - **Expert campaign** (p. 20): hit points recorded after scenarios 1 to 4 and set in 2 to 5; the heal costs 3 threat
 *   on the mission. A seat with no record (defeated in a scenario the others won) either pays it to rejoin or sits
 *   this scenario out and is asked again at the next (owner decision, 2026-10-08, row 72; what declining means is an
 *   interpretation, see `healForThreat`). The ally search is narrowed to the hero's traits. This box prints no "lose
 *   the campaign" for a lost game, so there is no `defeat` block: a game every player sat out of or was defeated in
 *   is lost and retried (p. 4).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOT AUTHORED: nothing.
