/**
 * The four expert-campaign instructions every box prints in nearly the same words (docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.46): record
 * remaining hit points after a win (capped at the base value), set them at the next setup, and the paid heal that
 * lets a player restore their identity to full, which a defeated player must pay to rejoin (wave 6 §4.1 Q11). The
 * heal's price is the box's: an acceleration token on the main scheme (`healToFull`), a facedown encounter card
 * (`healWithFacedownCard`) or threat on a scheme the box names (`healForThreat`). `healForThreat` alone lets a
 * defeated player decline and sit the scenario out (owner decision, 2026-10-08, for MC45).
 *
 * First used by `next_evol.ts`. `mut_gen.ts`, `mts.ts` and `mojo.ts` still carry their own copies of the same shapes
 * and are not touched here.

 * is how the printed sentence names the scheme.
 *
 * **A seat recorded at 0 or with no record** (it was defeated in a scenario its teammates won and sat out the Victory
 * steps) is asked whether to rejoin (`defeatedSeatRecordsZero` writes the 0, so an older record cannot survive). MC45 p. 20: "during the Setup instructions of the next scenario, the defeated
 * player can rejoin their teammates by placing 3 threat on that scenario's [MISSION] side scheme to restore their
 * identity to full hit points." Owner decision, 2026-10-08 (docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 row 72): the player may decline
 * rather than being made to pay. "Can" in the print allows it; the print does not say what happens to a player who
 * does not rejoin.
 *
 * **Interpretation (not printed, not an FFG ruling): a player who declines sits this scenario out and is asked again
 * at the next one.** Their identity is defeated here, during Setup, so the game goes on without them by the ordinary
 * rules of player elimination (RRG 1.8 "Player Elimination", p. 34): the first player token and what it controls pass
 * on, and if no player is left the game is lost, which the campaign's own loss rule then handles (MC45 p. 4, "they may
 * reset the scenario and try again with no penalty"). Won without them, they again take no part in the Victory steps
 * (p. 20), have no record, and are offered the rejoin at the following Setup. It is the smallest reversible reading;
 * the alternative, that a player who declines is out for the rest of the campaign, has no support in the print
 * either and could not be undone.
