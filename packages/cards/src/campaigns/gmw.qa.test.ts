/**
 * The Galaxy's Most Wanted (MC16) — rules-fidelity QA scenarios (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §11 step 7's own
 * `gmw.ts`), in the style of `trors.qa.test.ts`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Until `f7ec234f` ("fix(cards): query([], ...) no longer matches nothing"), `query([],
 * {printedId})` matched *nothing* (`packages/engine/src/select.ts`'s `explainQuery` treats any `categories` array,
 * including an empty one, as an active filter that an empty list can never satisfy), so every one of `gmw.ts`'s
 * `revealChallengeSideScheme`, `headhunterLadder`, and the Kree Supremacy reveal bridge — every place that names a
 * card by printed id alone — silently selected zero cards and did nothing, while `gmw.test.ts` kept passing,
 * because it only asserts log values (`units`, `marketCards`, campaign-runner bookkeeping) and never inspects the
 * resulting `GameState`. **Every test below drives a real game (`createGame`/`startGameFromLog`, not a synthetic
 * `CampaignGameResult`) up through its own setup, and asserts on `GameState` — the encounter deck's actual
 * contents, the villain area's actual side scheme instance and its actual threat — precisely because that is the
 * layer the bug lived in and the log-only tests could not see.**
 *
 * `campaigns/gmw.test.ts` and `wave3/gmw/campaign-challenge.test.ts` already cover: the log-level campaign walk,
 * the Market's cost/balance/one-copy rules, and (in `campaign-challenge.test.ts`'s own last `describe`) scenario
 * 1's Badoon Blitz face-by-mode reveal as a real game. This file does not repeat those; it extends the same
 * real-game technique to every scenario, to the threat placed (not just "revealed at all"), to the Headhunter
 * ladder's actual encounter-deck contents at each unlock tier, and to Kree Supremacy's "(Optional)" errata.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SECOND PASS (docs/phase7-wave3-qa.md "Checkpoint 3" step 4c): the campaign *walks* — a full standard and expert
 * campaign, the Victory units math at its own boundaries, the Market across visits, loss/retry, Expert-only
 * mechanics, and the log fields (Power Stone, evasion counters, Galactic Artifacts) that feed a later scenario's
 * setup. Everything below is grouped under "Priority 2" describes, one per numbered item in that step's brief.

/**
 * `mc16.s2.setup.collection` (RRG 1.8 p. 67 errata, "When setup ends, in player order, each player must choose 1
 * card from their hand and put it faceup into The Collection") is windowed `afterMulligans` and drives a
 * `forEachPlayer(eachPlayer, [chooseCards(min:1,max:1, from hand), moveCards(chosen, {scenarioArea: "The
 * Collection"})])` per `gmw.ts`.
 *
 * DIAGNOSIS (this pass): driving the real game and tracing every `cardMoved` event into `state.scenarioAreas["The
 * Collection"]` shows the instruction itself is correct — exactly one `cardMoved` per seat, each `from: {kind:
 * "hand"}`, in seat order, each moving the exact card `chooseCards` bound. The earlier report's "4, not 2" was
 * real but was comparing against the wrong baseline: Infiltrate the Museum's own main scheme, The Grand Collection
 * 1A, prints its own unconditional `Setup: Create "The Collection" game area. Put the top card of each player's
 * deck faceup into The Collection` (`packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/museum.ts`'s `16073a.setup`), which runs during
 * `resolveScenarioSetup` — *before* the campaign's `afterMulligans` window — and already seeds the area with 1
 * card per seat (2, in a 2-seat game) from the top of each deck. That is a second, independent, and correct
 * source into the same shared out-of-play area; it is not the Collector's discard redirect (which only fires on a
 * discard-from-play, and nothing discards during setup here) and not a double-fire of the campaign instruction. So
 * a 2-seat expert game legitimately ends setup with 4 cards in The Collection (2 from the main scheme's own setup,
 * 2 from the campaign's expert-only hand choice) — this instruction alone still only ever adds `seats.length`.
 * Likewise "hand unchanged at 5" was comparing against a hardcoded expectation (4) rather than each seat's own
 * actual post-mulligan hand size (6, for these decks); the real, instruction-attributable effect is each seat's
 * hand shrinking by exactly 1 from its own post-mulligan size, which this test now asserts directly instead of
 * against a hardcoded absolute.
