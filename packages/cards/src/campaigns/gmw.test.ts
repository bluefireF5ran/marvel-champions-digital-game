/**
 * `GMW_CAMPAIGN_DEFINITION` driven through the real runner (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §11 step 7's own
 * acceptance test, `trors.test.ts`'s pattern applied to MC16).
 *
 * Two halves, like `trors.test.ts`:
 *
 * - A **between-games walk** of all five nodes (`walk()`), each node's finished-game facts supplied directly as
 *   `CampaignGameResult.records` rather than derived from a played game — the same shortcut `trors.test.ts` takes
 *   for its own five-node walk, justified there and here the same way: what a game would have computed for a
 *   `record` instruction is exactly what `campaignResultOf` derives from `GameState`/events, which is `@mc/engine`'s
 *   own job to prove (`packages/engine/src/campaign/new-primitives.test.ts`), not this file's.
 * - A **real game**, set up from a composed log via `wave3Scenario`/`createGame`, proving the campaign's own
 *   Market grants and campaign-composed set-aside cards are accepted by real content.
