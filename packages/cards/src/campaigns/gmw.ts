/**
 * The Galaxy's Most Wanted (MC16) — the second `CampaignDefinition` (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §11 step 7 is
 * `trors.ts`; this is the box that exercises the design's own "MC16" rows: 1, 11, 15, 23, 25, 26, 30, 31, 35, 37,
 * 38, 47, 48, 53, 55).
 *
 * Source of truth: `docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc16_galaxys_most_wanted.md` (cited below as "MC16 p. N"),
 * cross-checked against the RRG 1.8 errata pages ("RRG 1.8 p. 67") the markdown conversion predates in two places
 * (see the header note on both). Every `CampaignInstruction` carries the citation of the printed bullet it encodes,
 * in the order that bullet is printed on its page.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS BOX ASKED OF THE FOUNDATION. Six gaps, all closed in `@mc/engine` (this file is content, so none of
 * them is worked around here — see each commit's own citation of the printed sentence that forced it):
 *
 * - `CampaignOp` `composeEncounterSets` gained `into: "deck" | "setAside"`. MC16's escalating Badoon Headhunter
 *   draws (below) and its Galactic Artifacts side schemes (`nebula`'s setup) shuffle *specific* cards from a
 *   campaign-composed set into the deck one at a time — which needs those cards to already be `GameState`
 *   instances (`campaignLog`/`encounterSetAside` selectors only ever match an existing instance) without putting
 *   the *whole* set into the deck the way MC60's own `composeEncounterSets` reading does. `into: "setAside"` makes
 *   a gathered set's cards available for a later selective pick instead.
 * - `CollectionFilter.unitCostExactly`, reading `PlayerCardCommon.unitCost` (MC16 p. 5's Market price) rather than
 *   `maxPrintedCost`'s printed play cost — a different number on the same card (most Market cards print cost 0).
 * - `CampaignValue` `seatCount`/`divide` and `CampaignPredicate` `valueAtLeast`: MC16 p. 10's "1[per_hero] or
 *   fewer cards in The Collection" is a threshold that is itself computed (the seat count), which
 *   `fieldAtLeast`'s literal `amount` cannot spell, and MC16 p. 12's "for every 2 Galactic Artifacts … record 1
 *   unit" is a quotient no existing `CampaignValue` combinator produced.
 * - `CampaignGameQuery` `cardsInScenarioArea` (the `record`-side mirror of the in-game `scenarioArea` selector,
 *   MC16 p. 10's Collection), `keywordValueSum`/`capAt` (MC16 p. 8's "units equal to the victory values … to a
 *   maximum of 3" — a *sum* of the printed `Victory X` keyword, not the card count `cardsInVictoryDisplay` gives),
 *   and `atMost` (`atLeast`'s complement, for "if there are no minions in play"/"no threat on the main scheme" —
 *   there is no negation over `CampaignGameQuery` to spell `not(atLeast(…, 1))` instead).
 * - `TargetQuery.printedId`: the Campaign Challenge side schemes print the *same* title on both mode faces
 *   (16178a/16178b "Badoon Blitz", …; docs/phase7-wave3.md §1.4 emits each as its own card precisely so this can
 *   tell them apart), and revealing "the standard face" is not "a side scheme named Badoon Blitz".
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO READINGS WORTH KNOWING ABOUT.
 *
 * 1. **The Market's "repeat this process as many times as you wish" is authored as a bounded, itemized list, not
 *    an engine loop.** `CampaignOp` has no repeat/while construct (design §4.5's closed vocabulary), and the
 *    Market is small and finite: 28 cards, exactly 4 at each of 7 price tiers (16150–16177). `marketShoppingOps`
 *    below offers each tier's remaining (`excludeGranted`) cards one at a time, up to 4 times per tier per seat —
 *    a hard ceiling on how many *physical* cards could ever be offered at that price, so it is complete (every
 *    reachable purchase set is still reachable, by declining the tiers/slots a seat doesn't want) without a loop
 *    primitive. Each slot's price is a `spend` **constant** (the tier), not "the chosen card's own price", because
 *    `campaignSet`'s `unitCostExactly` filter already guarantees every option in one slot costs the same.
 * 2. **MC16's own errata is applied, not the rulebook markdown's un-erratad wording.** RRG 1.8 p. 67: "RULEBOOK
 *    PG. 10, CAMPAIGN INSTRUCTIONS, SETUP, BULLET 5 — Should read: 'Expert Campaign Only: **When setup ends**, in
 *    player order, each player must choose 1 card from their hand and put it faceup into The Collection.'" — the
 *    conversion this file was written against has no "When setup ends", so the instruction below is windowed
 *    `afterMulligans` (RRG 1.8 Appendix II step 15, after hands are drawn) rather than the default
 *    `afterScenarioSetup`, which is what the errata's added clause means. RRG 1.8 p. 67 also errata's Kree
 *    Supremacy's reveal to "(Optional)" — already reflected in the markdown conversion this file reads, so no
 *    second reading is needed there, only the optional-reveal bridge below.
