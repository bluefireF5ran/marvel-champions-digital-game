 * `modularPickProblem` for a game played inside a campaign: a set the box's `Campaign.prohibited.encounterSetIds` bars
 * is never a modular pick there, whatever the scenario would otherwise allow. Shadowland's Black Flower (MC65 p. 5:
 * "Cards from the Black Flower modular set are required by some Campaign Instructions, so it cannot be included as a
 * modular set in any scenario while playing the campaign") is a modular set of Shadows in the Night and Shadow
 * Labyrinth on its own, so a picker that filters by `modularPickProblem` alone offers it; the campaign picker asks
 * this. Returns the reason, or null when the set may be picked.
