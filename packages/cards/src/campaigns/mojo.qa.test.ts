/**
 * `MOJO_CAMPAIGN_DEFINITION` (MojoMania) driven through the real runner and a real game at every node
 * (`mut_gen.qa.test.ts`'s shape; `mojo.test.ts` is the definition's own unit file):
 *
 * - **A full three-scenario campaign** (Spider-Man, one player): at every node the composed log starts a real game
 *   (`wave6Scenario` + the log's modular set picks + the composed Longshot set + `createGame`), the greedy headless
 *   driver (`../testing/driver.ts`) plays it to its real outcome, the session log is replayed to a deep-equal state, and
 *   `campaignResultOf` derives the node's result from the real final state and event stream.
 *   **Staged by surgery** (the scenarios' own e2e files, `../wave6/mojo/*-e2e.test.ts`, stage the same way, because the
 *   greedy driver cannot win these games unaided): MaGog starts with 4 ratings counters on The Challengers, Spiral on
 *   her CORNERED side at stage II with 14 damage, Mojo at stage II with 17 damage. Everything after that is played, and
 *   every outcome here is the driver's own (no outcome is overridden). The campaign seed (33) is the first of the seeds
 *   1-80 whose three staged games the driver wins (56 is the other); seeds 41 and 42 win scenario 1 and lose
 *   scenario 2 (17 and 47 did too, until a removal of threat could no longer target a scheme with no threat, RRG 1.8
 *   "Target" p. 42: Surveillance Team stopped being spent on the empty main scheme and the driver won scenario 2). It was 10 until 0 damage stopped opening a damage window (owner ruling 2026-10-06): in that game's
 *   first villain phase Spider-Man's defense covered MaGog's attack and the driver spent Backflip on the 0 damage.
 * - **A real lost-and-retried scenario**: scenario 2 really lost, folded as a loss with the log intact and the checked-off
 *   sets unchanged, and the retry starts a new real game.
 * - **An expert run**: a real expert scenario 1 game; its outcome is overridden to a win (`mut_gen.qa.test.ts`'s
 *   documented substitution, since the driver does not win expert MaGog), the real hit points it ended with recorded
 *   capped at base, and restored (and healed) in a real scenario 2 game.
