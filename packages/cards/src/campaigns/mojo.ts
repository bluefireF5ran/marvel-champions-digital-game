/**
 * MojoMania — the sixth `CampaignDefinition` (after `trors.ts`, `gmw.ts`, `mts.ts`, `sm.ts`, `mut_gen.ts`), and the first
 * box with no campaign-specific cards: three scenarios (MaGog, Spiral, Mojo) played in order, a card carried from one
 * to the next, and Longshot.
 *
 * Source of truth: the MojoMania insert ("insert p. N", Hall of Heroes' scan of the rulebook,
 * https://hallofheroeslcg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mojomania-insert.pdf): the campaign rules are pp. 4-5, the
 * three scenarios' Campaign Instructions pp. 9, 13-14 and 17. The campaign log is the back cover, which the scan does
 * not include, so the log fields below are read off the instructions that name them, not off the printed sheet.
 * Also `docs/phase7-wave6.md` §3.72, §4.1 (Q33, Q41-Q43) and ruling April 30, 2026 (3) #1.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MODELING
 *
 * - **Loss** (insert p. 4): "they may reset the scenario and try again with no penalty": `retry: "free"`, no DEFEAT
 *   block, and the log is restored to the node's start (`retryBaseline`), so a lost game checks off nothing.
 * - **Modular sets** (insert pp. 9, 13, 17). The campaign decides *which* sets a scenario uses, because the printed
 *   restriction ("You cannot choose to use modular encounter sets that are checked off") is a rule about the choice, and
 *   the choice is what the log can see. `modularSets` is a `strikeList` of the six genre sets, a struck option being a
 *   checked-off box; `modularPicked` is the working list a setup writes its picks to, in the order they were made, which
 *   the game builder reads (`mojoModularSetPicks`) and Victory checks off. Scenario 1 (no printed bullet; one set,
 *   "1 random genre set recommended", insert p. 7) offers the six sets; scenario 2 picks 3 unchecked ones; scenario 3
 *   picks 1 + one per player ("If there are not enough sets remaining, you may choose checked-off sets once all
 *   others are chosen"): each pick offers an unchecked set while one is left, and only then a checked-off one.
 * - **Longshot** (insert pp. 2, 9, 13-14, 17). Composed set aside at every node. Scenario 1 shuffles him in; Victory
 *   records `longshotInPlay` (by printed id: the wolv hero pack has an ally named Longshot too). Scenarios 2 and 3: if
 *   he was in play, one player (any seat, chosen by the players) may reveal him (ruling Apr 30, 2026 (3) #1: his When
 *   Revealed resolves); otherwise, or if they decline, he is shuffled into the encounter deck (owner, 2026-10-03).
 * - **Working fields** are per-seat and so cannot be `hidden` (the log keeps one hidden value per field, not one per
 *   seat); the per-seat and pick-list ones are marked `working` instead, which only keeps them off the Dossier.
 * - **The recorded card** (insert pp. 9, 14, 13, 17). Victory of scenarios 1 and 2 asks each player which support or
 *   upgrade they control costing at most 2 (3 when The Champion is on its BOOING CROWD side, scenario 1; when there is
 *   less than 10 per player threat on the main scheme, scenario 2) to record, never one with a dash cost. The game's
 *   facts are written to per-seat working fields by `record` instructions, and the player's choice is a between-games
 *   `choose` over them: the in-play cards of that seat within the cap, less the cards printing a dash. The pick is
 *   appended to `recordedCards`. Scenarios 2 and 3 put each recorded card into play from any player's deck, then add
 *   threat to the main scheme equal to the total cost.
 * - **Expert campaign** (insert p. 5): remaining hit points are recorded after a win (capped at base) and restored at
 *   the next setup; the heal is dealing yourself one facedown encounter card, and a defeated player (recorded hit
 *   points 0) must take it to rejoin (the token of `mts.ts`/`mut_gen.ts`, docs/phase7-wave6.md §4.1 Q11, here a card).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOT AUTHORED (each a recorded question, see the handoff): the insert's own words are ambiguous in four places, each
 * built as the most literal reading (Longshot's two were decided by the owner on 2026-10-03: a declined Longshot is
 * shuffled in, and any seat may reveal him): an X-cost card is not a "—" cost and may be recorded; a cost is the printed cost.
