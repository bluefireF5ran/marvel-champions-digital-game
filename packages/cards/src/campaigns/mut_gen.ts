/**
 * Mutant Genesis (MC32) — the fifth `CampaignDefinition` (after `trors.ts`, `gmw.ts`, `mts.ts`, `sm.ts`), and the first
 * box with player roles.
 *
 * Source of truth: `docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc32_mutant_genesis.md` (cited as "MC32 p. N"; the page numbers are the
 * PDF's: the five scenarios' Campaign Instructions are pp. 7, 10, 12, 16 and 19, the campaign rules pp. 4-5, the log
 * sheet p. 24) and `docs/phase7-wave6.md` §1.1, §1.7, §2.3, §3.20, §3.23, §3.24 and the §4.1 decisions (Q11-Q14).
 * Every `CampaignInstruction` carries the printed bullet it encodes, in printed order; an instruction the rulebook does
 * not print as a bullet (a composition step, the draw half of "takes 1 random upgrade") says so in its text.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MODELING
 *
 * - **Roles** (MC32 p. 5). `role` is a per-seat `choice` log field; "each player must choose a different role" is a
 *   shared `rolesTaken` strike list the seats choose from in order (`fieldOptions { unstruckOnly }`), striking what
 *   they take. The role pool is the role's own campaign set (`MUT_GEN_CAMPAIGN.roles`); `campaignSet` names one set
 *   by id, so "a random upgrade from their role's set" is one `if` per role.
 * - **Role upgrades.** Dealt between games (`random` over the role's set, which skips cards removed from the campaign,
 *   so the pool shrinks) into the seat's `roleUpgrade` field and set aside (`setAsideCards`); an in-game instruction
 *   puts the seat's own card into play under its control. Victory removes the card from the campaign ("Remove each role
 *   upgrade that began the game in play"). Each card's own "Remove this card from the game and the campaign pool" is
 *   an ability (the cards' scripts, a later task) and survives a retry (RRG 1.8 p. 29); an *unused* upgrade is not
 *   removed by a lost game, and the retry deals again from what the pool still holds (§4.1 Q12). The draw clears the
 *   seat's `roleUpgrade` first, so a scenario where no upgrade was earned removes nothing at its Victory.
 * - **Role-building** (MC32 p. 5): per seat, up to 1 event and up to 1 upgrade from the role's two aspects that the
 *   seat's deck does not already include (`notInOwnDeck`, by title), granted `thisGame` (they expire when the game
 *   ends, exempt from deck size).
 * - **Future Past deck** (§3.24). Every node composes the `future_past` and `mut_gen_campaign` sets set aside. Setup
 *   shuffles the recorded Future Past cards into the encounter deck, then builds the "Future Past" scenario deck from
 *   what is still set aside (`buildScenarioDeck { from: ["setAside"] }`), so a Future Past card that is in none of the
 *   log's lists is back in the deck next scenario (§4.1 Q13). Victory adds each Future Past card found in the
 *   encounter deck(s), discard pile(s) and in play to `futurePast` (`cardsInEncounterDeckAndDiscard`, appended
 *   `distinct`: a recorded card is shuffled back in and found again, and is not recorded twice; the set-aside "Future
 *   Past" scenario deck is not the encounter deck and is not read), and removes the Future Past cards in the victory
 *   display (recorded in `futurePastVictoryDisplay`, then `removeFromCampaign`).
 * - **Defeated flags.** "If the X side scheme was defeated" reads the defeat events (`cardsDefeated`), not "no longer
 *   in play": each campaign side scheme flips as it is defeated.
 * - **Captives and Jubilee.** Scenario 2's Victory records the CAPTIVE allies that entered play (`captives`) and
 *   whether Jubilee is in play (`jubilee`). Scenarios 3-5 set the recorded cards aside (`setAsideCards`) and the first
 *   player may shuffle each into any player's deck (the ally becomes that player's card for the game, §3.20, Q14);
 *   Jubilee is put into play under the first player's control.
 * - **Expert campaign** (MC32 p. 5): persistent hit points as every box does; the rejoin token is the price (Q11): a
 *   seat whose recorded hit points are 0 is not offered "Decline" (`mts.ts`'s `healToFull`, the same printed sentence).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOT AUTHORED: nothing. The two former notes are authored: Victory's "Add each Future Past card found in the encounter
 * deck, discard pile, and in play" (`cardsInEncounterDeckAndDiscard` with `inPlay`, appended `distinct`), and
 * role-building's "if the deck does not already include the chosen card" (`CollectionFilter.notInOwnDeck`).
