/**
 * `SHADOWLAND_CAMPAIGN_DEFINITION` (MC65): the definition is well-formed against the real `@mc/content` records, and
 * each
 * node's composition, setup and Victory instructions do what the insert prints (pp. 4 to 6, 9 to 10, 14 to 15, 17, 20),
 * driven through the real runner and real games built from the composed log (`shadowland-testing.ts`). Where a rule
 * needs a
 * finished game, the game is a real one settled through its setup with its outcome overridden to a win (`asWin`, said
 * so)
 * and the facts derived by `campaignResultOf`, with supports and upgrades put into play by state surgery (said so).
 *
 * Covered: the three nodes in order; the identity record and Daredevil's and Elektra's villains removed; the villain
 * draw
 * never offering a removed villain; scenario 1's Setup (Creeping Corruption under every player, the rest aside, Black
 * Flower's
 * other cards shuffled in, +1 threat per hero) and Victory (villain removed, OVERPOWERING, a recorded card); scenario
 * 2's
 * (counters, the recorded card in play, +3 threat per hero); scenario 3's (flags counted, the minions dealt); a loss
 * replayed
 * with no penalty; the expert rules; Black Flower out of the campaign picker; a whole campaign, standard and expert.
