/**
 * Sinister Motives (MC27) — the fourth `CampaignDefinition` (after `trors.ts`, `gmw.ts`, `mts.ts`), and the first
 * box with a reputation track rather than a flag pool or a unit currency.
 *
 * Source of truth: `docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc27_sinister_motives.md` (cited below as "MC27 p. N"; the
 * reputation track's own node/box layout on p. 22 was reconstructed from the PDF's vector drawing, per
 * `docs/phase7-wave5.md` §0/§2.3) and `docs/phase7-wave5.md` §2.3's own summary table. Every `CampaignInstruction`
 * carries the citation of the printed bullet it encodes, in the order that bullet is printed on its page.
 * `docs/phase7-wave5.md` §3.27 (landed 2026-09-26, 3be41be1) built exactly the reputation-marking vocabulary this
 * file uses (`packages/engine/src/campaign/sm-queries.test.ts`'s `REPUTATION_VICTORY`/`REPUTATION_CAMPAIGN`,
 * reused here nearly verbatim with real card/field names) and named this file as its own step 6.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * REPUTATION TRACK MODELING. MC27 p. 5: "Whenever a node connected to a **white box** is marked, resolve the
 * effects of that box immediately. Whenever a node connected to a **pink box** is marked, the Setup instructions
 * in that box will trigger at the beginning of each remaining scenario" (confirmed by every scenario's own setup
 * bullet, "Follow all 'Setup' instructions … for any marked nodes"). Read box-by-box (MC27 p. 22) rather than by
 * white/pink color (not transcribed per-node): **a bullet printed with a "Setup:" label is a pink, repeating
 * instruction; everything else in a box is a white, one-time effect resolved the instant its node crosses** — this
 * reading is confirmed by node 5's reward, whose printed sentence names no "Setup:" label ("During … game setup,
 * each player may take 1 additional mulligan") but is decided to behave like a pink box anyway (`docs/phase7-
 * wave5.md` §4.1 Q19: "marking node 5 appends a conditional instruction applied at every remaining scenario's
 * setup, like a pink box"), because its own effect is only meaningful *at* a future scenario's setup, the same
 * test a "Setup:" label would encode. Every pink (and node 5's reward) is authored as a `conditionalInstructions`
 * entry appended to `reputationSetups`, an `instructionList` field the runner resolves automatically at every
 * remaining scenario's setup (`runner.ts`'s `conditionalInstructions`) — so **no scenario needs to spell out "run
 * the appended reputation Setup instructions" itself**; the printed sentence to that effect is realized by the
 * engine, not authored as a `CampaignInstruction` here.
 *
 * The "(starting at the topmost unmarked node …)" marking order and the negative-victory-points clamp (ruling Aug
 * 3, 2026 (4) #2) are `sm-queries.test.ts`'s own `crossed(n)`/`clampAtZero` pattern, reused unchanged.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SKIPPED (engine gaps; see the report this file's own commit/PR cites, and the module-level TODOs beside each).
 * Gaps 1, 2, 4 and 5 are closed and kept here, numbered as before, because comments below cite the others by number.
 * Nothing below is worked around with a near-miss effect — each is left unauthored, with the printed text kept as
 * a comment so it can be picked up the moment the primitive exists:
 *
 * 1. *(Closed.)* **"Deal 3 … at random to a player. That player may choose 1 …" (node 1's reward, MC27 p. 22)**
 *    is authored in `sm.reputation.mark`: a `random` (count 3) into a per-seat slot, then a `choose` from
 *    `CampaignChoiceSource` `values(choice(slot))`, so the dealt three are the only options.
 * 2. *(Closed.)* **"Put the Venom (190) ally card into play …" (scenarios 3 and 4, MC27 p. 13/15), "… put a
 *    Helicarrier … into play …" (node 21's reward) and "… put a Symbiote Suit … into play …" (node 25's reward,
 *    MC27 p. 22)** are authored with `CampaignOp` `setAsideCards` (the card, from outside the game, set aside at
 *    setup) plus an `inGame` `putIntoPlay` from `encounterSetAside` (`bringIntoGame`, `putVenomIntoPlay`,
 *    `eachPlayerMayPutIntoPlay`). Whoever the card enters play under becomes its owner (RRG 1.8 "Ownership and
 *    Control", p. 31), so it leaves play to that player's discard pile.
 * 3. **Sandman's Expert-Campaign-Only "Place 2 additional sand counters on the City Streets environment. Resolve
 *    its 'Surging Sands' ability'" (MC27 p. 9).** `addCounters` reaches the counters; there is no generic "resolve
 *    the named sub-ability '[X]' printed on this card" primitive (only `resolveWhenRevealedOf`/`resolveSpecialsOf`,
 *    neither of which is what "Surging Sands" is — City Streets' own custom ability, scripted by whoever writes
 *    `wave5/sm/sandman.ts`, not campaign data). Unauthored.
 * 4. *(Closed.)* **Node 17's penalty, "Setup: The first player must search the encounter deck and discard pile for
 *    a scenario-specific side scheme, then reveal it. Place 1[per_hero] threat on that side scheme. (Shuffle.)"
 *    (MC27 p. 22)** is authored as `sm.rep.node17.penalty` with `TargetQuery.scenarioSpecific` (RRG 1.8
 *    "Scenario-Specific Card", p. 39: the set of the scenario's own main scheme, never a modular or campaign set).
 *    Mysterio's own set prints no side scheme, so there the search finds nothing and nothing is revealed (RRG 1.8
 *    "Search", p. 39: only a card that is found is moved).
 * 5. *(Closed.)* **"… at random that does not have its title recorded in the 'Community Service' section"
 *    (scenarios 2-4, MC27 p. 11/13/15)** is authored in `communityServicePick` with `CampaignChoiceSource`
 *    `excludingTitles` over the `communityService` field.
 *
 * Also not attempted here (out of this file's scope per the brief): scripting the 16 campaign cards themselves
 * (174-189, `ability-scripting-engineer`'s later pass) and the expert campaign's optional deck-customization
 * freeze (a deck-builder rule, not a `CampaignDefinition` instruction).
