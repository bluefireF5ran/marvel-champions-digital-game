/**
 * The Rise of Red Skull (MC10) — rules-fidelity QA scenarios (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §11 step 9).
 *
 * Source of truth: `docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc10_the_rise_of_red_skull.md` ("MC10 p. N"), RRG 1.8
 * `docs/rules/mc_rulesreference_v18_compressed.pdf` p. 11 and pp. 28–29 ("RRG p. N"), and
 * `docs/rulings/marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md` (cited by date). Every RRG quote in this file is copied verbatim from
 * a citation `game-rules-architect` already embedded next to the code it verifies (`packages/engine/src/deck.ts`'s
 * `DeckProblemCode` doc comments, `packages/engine/src/campaign.ts`) — both read the PDF directly when they were
 * written, so this file reuses those already-sourced quotes rather than re-opening the PDF.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TECHNIQUE — which tests are real games and which are synthetic, per `trors.test.ts`'s own documented rule that
 * this must be flagged, not silently presented as more real than it is.
 *
 * - **Most tests here drive only the *between-games* half** (`resolveBetweenGames`/`applyCampaignResult`), handing
 *   `applyCampaignResult` a synthetic `CampaignGameResult` in place of a played game. This is exactly the technique
 *   `trors.test.ts`'s own five-node "between-games instructions" walk already established: no `GameState` is ever
 *   touched, and a `record` instruction's value is *given* rather than computed, standing in for exactly what
 *   `campaignResultOf` would have derived from a real finished game — which `trors.test.ts`'s real-game test and
 *   `@mc/engine`'s own `campaign-primitives.test.ts`/`campaign/runner.test.ts` prove separately, at the primitive
 *   level. Every such test is labeled "(synthetic)" in its `it()` name.
 * - **"a real, engine-recognized win" plays a real, driven game to its actual winning conclusion** — no override.
 *   The villain's stage range is narrowed to a single, lower-HP stage using `GameSetupConfig`'s own
 *   `villainStartStageIndex`/`villainLastStageIndex` fields — the same fields `wave2/setup.ts`'s
 *   `buildSingleVillain` already uses to pick standard vs. expert stage ranges — so nothing here is an engine hack;
 *   it is the existing knob for "how much of this villain is in this game", pushed to its smallest legal value.
 * - **"persistent damage" plays a real game to its real, *losing* conclusion**, then re-derives `campaignResultOf`
 *   with that finished state's `outcome` overridden to a win — exactly `trors.test.ts`'s own documented technique
 *   (see that file's header for why: the driver reliably loses at full scenario strength, so a real loss is the
 *   only way to get a real, damaged-but-alive identity to record persistent damage from). Labeled "(forced win)".

 * steps for that scenario. However, they can rejoin their teammates for the next scenario by adding an obligation
 * to their deck during setup to restore their identity to full hit points." Maintainer decision 2026-09-23 (no FFG
 * ruling exists): unlike MC16 p. 5's free rejoin, the obligation here is the mandatory price of rejoining.
 *
 * Synthetic (per this file's header technique note): `applyCampaignResult` is handed a `CampaignGameResult` whose
 * `sittingOut: [2]` stands in for whatever `campaignResultOf` would have derived from a real game where seat 2 was
 * eliminated (`GameState.players[i].eliminated`) in a scenario the team won — `@mc/engine`'s own
 * `campaign/result.test.ts` / `campaign/runner.test.ts` already cover that derivation at the primitive level, and
 * `gmw.qa.test.ts`'s "Elimination and Victory" describe block proves it against a real finished `GameState` for the
 * sibling MC16 policy.
