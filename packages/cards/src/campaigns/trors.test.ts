/**
 * `TRORS_CAMPAIGN_DEFINITION` played headlessly through the real runner (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §11 step 7's
 * own acceptance test), for the first two scenarios: `resolveBetweenGames` composes Crossbones from a fresh log, a
 * real game is created and driven with `../testing/driver.ts`'s greedy player, `campaignResultOf`/
 * `applyCampaignResult` fold the result back, and the resulting log feeds straight into composing Absorbing Man
 * the same way. Not a synthetic campaign — real Crossbones/Absorbing Man content, real starter decks.
 *
 * **On forcing the outcome.** `../testing/driver.ts`'s greedy player is built to reach *an* outcome, not to win —
 * confirmed empirically while writing this test: across 20 solo seeds each, it never won Rhino (Core's own
 * easiest scenario), Crossbones or Absorbing Man; every game ended `mainSchemeCompleted` or `allPlayersDefeated`.
 * MC10 p. 3's loss is "no penalty, try again", which this campaign models with an empty `defeat` list for both
 * these nodes (`trors.ts`) — so a *real* driver loss proves the retry path (the log restores to `logBefore` and
 * `nextNodeId` stays on the same node) but proves nothing about the victory writes this file exists to check.
 * Rather than skip that half, each game is driven to its real (losing) conclusion — proving every `inGame` setup
 * effect resolves legally inside real content and the loss/retry path is correct — and then the *victory* half is
 * proven by re-deriving `campaignResultOf` from that same real, played-out state with its `outcome` overridden to
 * a win. The state, the event stream and every card instance are genuine; only the win/loss verdict is substituted,
 * exactly the fact the driver cannot reliably produce. Flagged here rather than silently presented as a win.
