/**
 * The Rise of Red Skull (MC10) — the first `CampaignDefinition` (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §11 step 7).
 *
 * Source of truth: `docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc10_the_rise_of_red_skull.md` (the primary rulebook conversion,
 * cited below as "MC10 p. N") and `docs/campaign-modes/log-sheets/mc10_the_rise_of_red_skull_campaign-log.pdf`
 * (transcribed into that same markdown's "Campaign Log Sheet Reference" section). Every `CampaignInstruction`
 * carries the citation of the printed bullet it encodes, in the order that bullet is printed on its page.
 *
 * This file is plain data — the same discipline `packages/engine/src/testing/campaign.ts`'s synthetic fixture and
 * `packages/content/src/data/trors/campaign.ts`'s `Campaign` record both already use — rather than a builder
 * layer, because a `CampaignDefinition` is small enough (five linear nodes) that plain object literals read at
 * least as clearly as calls into a bespoke builder API would, and the engine's own types catch every shape error.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS BOX ASKED OF THE FOUNDATION. Writing it found six gaps, all now closed in `@mc/engine` (this file is
 * content, so none of them is worked around here):
 *
 * - `CampaignChoiceSource` `campaignSet`/`perSeatSet` take a `filter`, because the `hydra_camp` set holds two
 *   unrelated four-card pools offered by different scenarios — the TECH upgrades (MC10 p. 5) and the "Basic"
 *   Condition upgrades (MC10 p. 7). Both choices below are that filter plus `excludeGranted`.
 * - `CampaignGameQuery` `cardsTuckedUnder` reads the cards under a host card, which no in-play selection can see
 *   (RRG 1.8 "Tuck"): Zola's "record the name of each ally underneath [Hydra Prison]" (MC10 p. 12).
 * - `CampaignOp` `random` takes `optional`, for "each player **may** add 1 random obligation" (MC10 p. 7, p. 10,
 *   p. 12, p. 15): the players decide whether, never which.
 * - `CampaignPredicate` `choiceMade` reads whether a seat took an optional choice or declined it, and a `flag`
 *   written from nothing is now *unchecked* rather than checked — the polarity every "may" below depends on.
 * - `deck.ts` exempts a campaign grant from two refusals it applied unconditionally: a `specificTo.kind ===
 *   "scenario"` card (MC10 p. 10's rescued Captive allies, added to decks by instruction) and an `obligation`
 *   (MC10 p. 17, "they have player-card backs because they are meant to be added to player decks"). Both stay
 *   illegal as ordinary deckbuilding choices.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO READINGS WORTH KNOWING ABOUT.
 *
 * 1. **The obligation draw reads one shared set, not four numbered ones.** MC10 p. 17 prints four numbered Expert
 *    Campaign Sets and says "they must take that card from the set that matches their player number", which is
 *    `CampaignChoiceSource.perSeatSet`. `@mc/content`'s `TRORS_CAMPAIGN` has no `perSeatSetIds`: the ingested data
 *    is one `expcamp` set holding 4 copies of each obligation rather than four per-seat sets (see that record's own
 *    note). Drawing from the one set is the same draw — the four sets are identical — but it is a `campaignSet`
 *    source until the data is split, and it is the one place this file is not literally what p. 17 says.
 * 2. **Each seat's own "Basic" upgrade is identified by the card, not by the seat.** `setGrantFace` flips a card's
 *    face wherever it was granted; `excludeGranted` on the p. 7 choice means at most one seat can hold each of the
 *    four upgrades, so "that player's upgrade" and "that card" name the same grant.
