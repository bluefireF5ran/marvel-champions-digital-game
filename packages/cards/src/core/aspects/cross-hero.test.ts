/**
 * "Cards in another hero's deck" (`docs/custom-deck-testing.md`, "Cards in another hero's deck") for the Core Set's
 * own aspect and basic player cards (01050-01093): each is played through the engine from a Core hero whose precon
 * does NOT ship that aspect's cards, so a script that quietly assumes its precon hero (Spider-Man for Justice, Captain
 * Marvel for Leadership, She-Hulk or Iron Man for Aggression, Black Panther for Protection) is caught.
 *
 * Seats (all legal 40+ card decks, `requireLegalDecks` left on): Justice from She-Hulk, Leadership from Iron Man,
 * Aggression from Black Panther, Protection from Captain Marvel; Basic cards from Iron Man (aggression precon, basic
 * cards are legal anywhere). Each aspect seat is built by hand (`aspectSeat`): the hero's own signature cards, every
 * Core card of the chosen aspect at its deck limit, and the precon's basic cards, because `buildCrossHeroDeck` cannot
 * swap an aspect without dropping under 40 cards (it refuses to backfill).
 *
 * Covered (every Core aspect/basic card with an ability script): justice 01058 Daredevil, 01059 Jessica Jones, 01060
 * For Justice!, 01061 Great Responsibility, 01062 The Power of Justice, 01063 Interrogation Room, 01064 Surveillance
 * Team, 01065 Heroic Intuition; leadership 01066 Hawkeye, 01067 Maria Hill, 01068 Vision, 01069 Get Ready, 01070 Lead
 * from the Front, 01071 Make the Call, 01072 The Power of Leadership, 01073 The Triskelion, 01074 Inspired; aggression
 * 01050 Hulk, 01051 Tigra, 01052 Chase Them Down, 01053 Relentless Assault, 01054 Uppercut, 01055 The Power of
 * Aggression, 01056 Tac Team, 01057 Combat Training; protection 01075 Black Widow, 01076 Luke Cage, 01077
 * Counter-Punch, 01078 Get Behind Me!, 01079 The Power of Protection, 01080 Med Team, 01081 Armored Vest, 01082
 * Indomitable; basic 01083 Mockingbird, 01084 Nick Fury, 01085 Emergency, 01086 First Aid, 01087 Haymaker, 01091
 * Avengers Mansion, 01092 Helicarrier, 01093 Tenacity.
 *
 * Printed ability forms checked against the card text (data `text.printed`) and the script: Hero Action cards (01060,
 * 01053, 01054, 01070, 01087, 01093; and 01078 / 01061 Hero Interrupts) are refused in alter-ego form (RRG 1.8 "Hero
 * Action" / "Hero Interrupt"); plain Action cards and supports (01064, 01056, 01080, 01069, 01071, 01086, 01091,
 * 01092, 01068) are used from alter-ego form, and plain Interrupt 01085 Emergency fires while the villain schemes
 * against an alter-ego.
 *
 * Skipped: 01088-01090 Energy / Genius / Strength (resources with no ability script). 01044 etc. are Black Panther's
 * identity-specific cards, not aspect cards. Not covered by an interaction test: the "Max N per deck / per player"
 * deckbuilding lines (deck-legality tests own those) and 01077's boundary with an undefended attack (no defend, no
 * trigger).
 *
 * RRG 1.8 citations: "Ally Limit" p. 7 (01073), "Defend, Defense" p. 15 (damage checks leave attacks undefended),
 * "Overkill" (01053), "Toughness" (01076), "Stun" (01083), "Form" / "Hero Action" / "Alter-Ego Action" (form checks).
