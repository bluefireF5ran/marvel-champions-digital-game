/**
 * docs/competitive-mode-plan.md §3.4 and §4 task 7 (docs/phase7-wave10.md §3.5): the DSL word `enemyTeamChooses`, the
 * chooser of a choice a card gives to "the enemy team". The engine's `enemy-team-authority.test.ts` reads the same spec
 * on a two-team state.
 *
 * Sources: MC56 p. 6 (cooperative play): "Any rule or ability that refers to 'the enemy team' refers to the players.
 * Resolve these abilities using the grim rule: Imagine what an opponent would do if it were their choice." The owner's
 * decision (2026-10-11, question 6, answer A): the first player makes the choice, in a prompt marked as the enemy
 * team's, and the log records it as made for the enemy team.
 *
 * The games here are real Core games against Rhino, which is not a Civil War scenario: the When Revealed of Hard to
 * Keep Down (01104) is rebound to the ability under test, so it resolves through a real villain phase reveal.
