/**
 * docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md §S3.9 (engine task E9): every ally a query matches treated as a minion, with the
 * real Baron Zemo card (`fne` 60145) in Core's Rhino scenario. The scripts are this test's own;
 * `fne/scenarios/the-raft-breakout.ts` scripts the card itself.
 *
 * 60145: "Villainous. Treat each ally with threat on it as a [Deceived] minion with a blank text box. Its SCH is equal
 * to its base THW and it does not take consequential damage. When Revealed: Place 1 threat on an ally without threat on
 * it. It engages its controller."
 *
 * MC60 p. 26 FAQ: when Baron Zemo leaves play, those allies are allies again, under their owner's control, and keep
 * the threat. RRG 1.8 "Ability" (p. 5): a constant's effects "are active anytime the specific condition is met". RRG
 * 1.8 "Base Value" (p. 10): "A defined value before modifiers are applied". Ruling Dec 17, 2025 (1) #3: the change is
 * "essentially a status change"; nothing enters or leaves play.
