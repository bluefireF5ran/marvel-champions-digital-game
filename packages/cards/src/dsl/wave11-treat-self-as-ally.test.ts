/**
 * docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md §S3.8 (engine task E8): threat on a minion, and a minion its own constant treats as
 * an ally while that constant holds, with the real Black Cat card (`fne` 60169) in Core's Rhino scenario. The scripts
 * are this test's own; `fne/scenarios/kingpin.ts` scripts the card itself.
 *
 * 60169: "Villainous. While there is 4 threat here, treat Black Cat as an ally that takes 2 consequential damage after
 * she attacks or thwarts. Hero Action: Spend a [mental] resource → place 1 threat here. If there is 4 threat here,
 * take control of Black Cat as an ally."
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Card Types" (p. 12): "When a player changes a minion to an ally, that player takes control of that ally."
 * RRG 1.8 "Ability" (p. 5): a "while" constant's effects "are active anytime the specific condition is met". MC60 p. 26
 * FAQ: Black Cat keeps the villainous keyword while she is an ally. RRG 1.8 "Threat" (p. 44): threat tracks the threat
 * on scheme cards, so "when threat would be placed on a scheme" does not hear threat placed on her.
