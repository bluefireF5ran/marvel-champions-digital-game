/**
 * Rules-QA 2026-10-04: modular encounter set cards that assume their home scenario, played in a scenario where the named
 * villain, scheme, attachment or card is absent, and in scenarios whose "the villain" / "the encounter deck" is not a
 * single ordinary thing (Tower Defense's several villains, Kang's separate game areas, Mansion Attack's random villain).
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Modular Encounter Set" (p. 29): modular sets "can be added to and/or removed from nearly any scenario"; Appendix VI
 * (p. 71): "A group may choose to play any scenario with any modular encounter sets". A card's text is therefore its own
 * fallback: "If X is not in play, search ... " must find nothing and carry on, "If you cannot, this card gains surge"
 * must surge, and a search that finds nothing still shuffles (RRG "Search", p. 39).
 *
 * Every test names the printed text it proves. Hosts: Rhino (Core), Sandman and Tower Defense.
