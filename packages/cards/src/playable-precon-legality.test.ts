/**
 * Every precon in the playable pool, checked against the whole pool rather than its own pack
 * (docs/custom-deck-testing.md, "Deck builder start state"). The per-wave precon tests
 * (`wave1-`, `wave3-`, `wave4-precon-legality.test.ts`) check each wave against its own cards; Core and wave 2 had no
 * such test, and a player's deck is always validated against the full pool. For each precon:
 * - it is legal under `validateDeck`;
 * - the deck builder's start state for its identity (`requiredIdentitySet`) is exactly the precon's own signature
 *   cards, so a new deck for that hero opens with the right cards;
 * - it can be seated: nothing in it, its obligation or its nemesis set is unscripted (`unscriptedCards`).
 * Wave 5 joined this list once it was wired into the playable pool (PR #64 step 5); `wave5-precon-legality.test.ts`
 * still covers it against wave 5's own pool alone.
