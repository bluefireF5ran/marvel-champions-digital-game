/**
 * Which setup choices a playable scenario offers, as plain functions a setup screen asks before it draws a control
 * (docs/phase7-wave8.md section 4.1 Q1, Q9, Q10, Q12). `playableScenario` takes the answers through
 * `PlayableScenarioOptions` and refuses one the scenario does not offer, so a screen that follows these never builds a
 * game that throws.
 *
 * - **Standard and Expert set alternatives** (`difficultySetAlternativesFor`): The Hood insert, p. 2, "Alternative
 *   Sets": "When a scenario requires the Standard encounter set, the Standard II encounter set may be used instead",
 *   and the same for Expert II. Owner decision (Q10 = A, not printed in the insert or RRG): Standard III may replace the
 *   Standard set on any scenario that uses it. The rule reads the scenario record, never its pack: every scenario whose Standard set is the plain Standard set, from
 *   any box, is offered every other set of the Standard classification.
 * - **The Horsemen's versions** (`horsemanSidesOffer`): the Four Horsemen only, one A/B choice per villain (Q9 = B).
 * - **The easier Apocalypse start** (`offersEasierStart`): Apocalypse on standard only (Q12 = A).
 * - **Threat on Gene Pool** (`genePoolThreatOffer`): any game whose sets include Infinites (Q1 = A), 0 to 3 per player.
 * - **A Civil War scenario's choices** (docs/phase7-wave10.md §3.1, MC56 pp. 4-5): the two sides and their leaders
 *   (`sides`), the stage 1 and stage 2 options of the leader's side (`mainSchemeStages`), every modular set with
 *   whether this leader may use it (`modularSets`), and the game modes (`gameModes`). All four are null at a scenario
 *   that is not a Civil War leader. `modularSetCount` is the count of modular picks any scenario takes, as a range.
 * - **The villain** (`villainChoiceOffer`; docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md §S3.3, MC60 p. 5): the villains a Fear No
 *   Evil scenario may be played against and its default, answered as `PlayableScenarioOptions.villainSetId`; at a
 *   card-keyed choice (Shadowland's Dark Protégé, docs/phase7-shadowland.md §4.1) answered as `villainCardId`, with
 *   "random" the default. Null at every scenario whose villain is fixed (`Scenario.villainOptions` absent).
