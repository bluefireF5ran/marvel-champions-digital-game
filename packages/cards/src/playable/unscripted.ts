/**
 * Wave 9 content that is in the card pool but not playable yet, and the one place that says so.
 *
 * Gating is by encounter set, in one list: `UNSCRIPTED_ENCOUNTER_SET_IDS`. A listed set is left out of the playable
 * encounter sets (so no modular pick, no extra-set pick and no table setup can name it), a scenario that uses one of
 * them as its own set is left out of the playable scenarios (Trickster Takeover's Enchantress and God of Lies), and a
 * scenario's random pool of modular sets drops it (Thunderbolts' pool of ten: Techno and Whiteout).
 * `unscripted.test.ts` checks every id here still has an unscripted ability ref, so the day a set is scripted the test
 * says so; the cards stay in the pool and in `PLAYABLE_CARDS` either way, because the card data is not what is gated.
 *
 * **To un-gate a set, delete its id from the list below** (the playable scenarios, the pools and the client's lists
 * follow). To un-gate everything, make the list empty.
