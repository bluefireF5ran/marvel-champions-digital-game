/**
 * Owner decision of 2026-10-08 (docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 row 73, rules check A1, second half), proved on REAL cards:
 * an "(attack)" ability that makes its attack after an earlier instruction begins that attack when the ability begins
 * resolving, like an ability that only deals damage (row 61).
 *
 * Official rule, RRG 1.8 "Labeled Ability" (p. 26): "The identity of the player using the labeled ability is considered
 * to be performing the labeled effect when the labeled ability begins resolving (after costs have been paid)."
 *
 * The rule is the engine's (`packages/engine/src/resolve/attack-ability.ts`, fixtures in the engine's
 * `attack-label.test.ts`, "Row 73"); no card script was rewritten for it. Each test states the order before the
 * decision (the attack, and its "when … attacks" window, began at the damage instruction) and asserts the order now.
 * What the engine reads ahead to decide that an attack will be made, and what a stun received meanwhile does, are
 * interpretations, stated with their alternatives in that file.
 *
 * Every card is played from a real Core Spider-Man (Justice) hand in a real Rhino game (`testing/qa-bench.ts`).
