/**
 * Wave 10 engine-rules QA, change 2 (commits 77e58bfa and 5fc79976, owner answers 30B, 32B, 35B, 36B, 37A, 38A): a
 * revealed minion's When Revealed resolves before Quickstrike; the Responses to its entering play wait until the reveal
 * has finished; a minion put into play without a reveal is unchanged. Proved on OLDER real cards (Core to wave 9) whose
 * behavior the change moves: the survey is docs/phase7-wave10-q30-impact.md.
 *
 * Sources:
 * - RRG 1.8 "Quickstrike" (p. 36): "the quickstrike keyword resolves after any 'When Revealed' abilities on that minion
 *   are resolved".
 * - RRG 1.8 "Reveal" (p. 38): Responses to any step of the revealing "are not resolved until after all steps of the
 *   reveal process have been completed"; FAQ "Widow's Bite (#10)", p. 60: "Keywords have timing priority over 'Response'
 *   abilities, so Quickstrike resolves first."
 * - owner answer 38A (docs/phase7-wave10.md §4.0): a minion put into play without a reveal opens its enters-play response
 *   window before Quickstrike, as before. The RRG's FAQ #10 sentence is general ("Keywords have timing priority over
 *   Response abilities"); see the report's question Q-A.
