  /**
   * Counterattack (08030, aggression), Rapid Response (08031, leadership), Defensive Stance (08032, protection) and
   * Espionage (08033, basic) are bundled in the Black Widow pack but are **not** part of the 40-card "Black Widow
   * (Justice)" precon `bkw-justice` (`packages/content/src/data/bkw/starterDecks.ts` lists only up to card 08024) —
   * they're pool cards for a differently-built Black Widow deck (a different secondary aspect, or a generic/basic
   * card usable by any deck). Reaching them through a *real game* the way the tests above do would need a second,
   * fully-built 40-card legal deck of a different aspect, which is disproportionate for four cards whose shapes are
   * already proven elsewhere in this exact test file (Counterattack mirrors Counter-Punch's own Core shape; Rapid
   * Response mirrors nothing new — `putIntoPlay` + `dealDamage`; Defensive Stance/Espionage mirror Wiggle
   * Room's/Attacrobatics' own prevent/cancel shapes). This matches `msm`'s own precedent: its four analogous
   * off-precon pack cards (Melee, Concussive Blow, Morale Boost, Down Time — `wave1/msm/pack-cards.test.ts`'s own
   * doc comment) have no dedicated tests either. They're still scripted (not a "record and skip" gap) and exercised
   * structurally by `coverage.test.ts` and `defineAbilities`'s own validation at import time.
