/**
 * "Cards in another hero's deck" (`docs/custom-deck-testing.md`, "Cards in another hero's deck"): every Black Widow
 * pack (`bkw`, 08001a-08033) aspect/basic player card that has an ability script — every one whose own `aspect` is
 * not `hero:08001a` (an identity-specific card, RRG 1.8 "Identity-Specific Card", p. 23, only a Black Widow deck
 * could hold) — played through the engine from a Core hero's own precon instead of Black Widow's.
 *
 * Covered (11): 08011 Agent Coulson, 08012 Quake, 08013 Stealth Strike, 08017 Counterintelligence, 08018 Spycraft
 * (refused: no Spy character), 08023 Quincarrier (refused in alter-ego, works in hero form), 08024 Target Acquired,
 * 08030 Counterattack, 08031 Rapid Response, 08032 Defensive Stance, 08033 Espionage (refused: no Spy character).
 * Skipped: 08014 The Power of Justice, 08015 Interrogation Room,
 * 08016 Surveillance Team and 08019 Nick Fury (verbatim Core reprints aliased in `../reprints.ts`); 08020-08022
 * Energy/Genius/Strength print no ability (`abilities: []`); 08025-08029 are the obligation/nemesis/encounter cards,
 * not player aspect cards.
 *
 * Seats: justice and basic in Spider-Man/Justice, leadership in Captain Marvel/Leadership, aggression in
 * She-Hulk/Aggression, protection in Black Panther/Protection (`CORE_HERO_FOR_ASPECT`).
