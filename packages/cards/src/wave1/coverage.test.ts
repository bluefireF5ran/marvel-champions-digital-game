/**
 * Coverage for every wave 1 pack (docs/phase7-wave1-scripting.md "Status"): which packs are fully scripted, which

 * accounted for entirely by `reprints.ts`'s automatic Core-reprint aliasing, never a stray hand-scripted id.
 *
 * The pack list itself (code, card array) is imported straight from `@mc/content`, the same eight arrays
 * `packages/content/src/data/wave1.test.ts` iterates — never a separately hand-maintained id list — so a ninth
 * pack lands here automatically the moment `@mc/content` exports it, instead of silently going unchecked.
