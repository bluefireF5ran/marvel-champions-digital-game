 * Vapors of Valtorr (09035): "Special: Choose a status card in play. Replace that status card with a different
 * status card. Place this card in the Invocation deck discard pile." Was a skip pending an OR over status types;
 * landed with the wave B primitives batch as `TargetQuery.hasAnyStatus` (docs/phase7-wave1-scripting.md §6) —
 * "a status card in play" is read as "a character with any status" (RRG 1.8 "Status Cards", p. 42), since a status
 * is an attachment to a character rather than an independently targetable card. Which status it currently has,
 * and therefore which two are genuinely "different", is read with `hasStatus` per option: the outer choice picks
 * the character's current status (exactly one condition is ever true in the normal case of a single status, so it
 * resolves without asking), and a nested choice offers the other two as the replacement — the printed text names no
 * specific replacement, so RRG "Choose" defaults to the ability's controller deciding. Each replacement is one
 * `replaceStatus` effect, so a character whose status card cannot be replaced (a Stalwart enemy's tough card) is no
 * valid target (ruling Jun 20, 2024, post-RRG 1.5 #215).
