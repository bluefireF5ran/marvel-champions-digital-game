 * "Discard a card from your hand with the highest cost" (Thoughtcasting, both halves): bind every hand card, keep the

 * hand is not theirs (p. 42, "Table Talk"; owner answer 211, docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md §4.1), then discard it.
 * `<slot>` receives exactly the one discarded card, read by each half's own follow-up effect.
 *
 * **`chooseCards`, not `chooseTarget`.** `chooseTarget`'s `TargetQuery`/`inSlot` narrowing only ever matches
 * in-play instances (`matchesQuery`'s domain) — exactly right for a *board* pick among a bound slot (Clash of the
 * Titans' tied enemies/characters, `wave1/hlk/nemesis.ts`; Burn Notice's tied in-play Preparation cards,
 * `wave1/bkw/obligation.ts`, `PREPARATION_YOU_CONTROL`'s `categories: ["ally","support","upgrade"]`), but a
 * *hand* card is never "in play", so `chooseTarget(slot, { inSlot: "costly" })` always found zero candidates here —
 * confirmed by direct engine tracing (an empty "costly" bind silently short-circuits `chooseTarget`, `moveCards`,
 * and `placeThreat`/`takeDamage` right along with it, with no error). `chooseCards`'s `from` is a `CardSelector`,
 * not a `TargetQuery`, and `cards(chosen("costly"))` (`kind: "ref"`, resolved via the generic `resolveRef`, not
 * `matchesQuery`) reads a bound slot regardless of zone — the same "already known gaps" class of Interrupt/Response
 * primitive gap, but this one was a plain misuse of an existing primitive, fixed here rather than skipped.

 * Doctor Strange's nemesis set: Baron Mordo (09028, nemesis minion), Open the Dark Dimension (09029, side scheme),

 *
 * Counterspell (09030): "Attach to your hero (data). Forced Interrupt: When you play an event, cancel its effects
 * and discard it. Then, discard this card." Was a skip because `cancelTriggeringEvent` only flagged the
 * `cardBeingPlayed` *event frame* as cancelled (closing its own interrupt/response windows) without stopping the
 * played card's own printed-ability effect frames, already queued independently on the stack by the time the
 * interrupt resolved — unlike `resolve/reveal.ts`'s `case "enterPlay"`, which already gated an encounter card's own
 * When Revealed on `!frame.effectsCancelled`. Landed with the wave B primitives batch (docs/phase7-wave1-scripting.md
 * §6): `play-card.ts` now pushes a card's own ability frames in a later `"abilities"` stage, after the
 * `cardBeingPlayed` window resolves, so there's something left for `cancelIt()` to cancel. Per RRG 1.8 "Cancel"
 * (p. 11) the play still stands otherwise — cost paid, "Max N per round" counted, `cardPlayed` still announced, and
 * the event still goes to its owner's discard "because it is still considered played" — so "cancel its effects and
 * discard it" needs no separate discard effect of its own; only "Then, discard this card" (Counterspell itself) is
 * scripted here.
