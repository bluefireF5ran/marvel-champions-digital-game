 * Doctor Strange (`drs`) pack cards outside his signature kit/nemesis/obligation sets (`aspect` is the generic

 * (09014, protection ally), Desperate Defense (09015, protection event), Momentum Shift (09016, protection event),
 * The Night Nurse (09019, protection support), Warning (09021, basic event), The Sorcerer Supreme (09026, basic
 * upgrade), Skilled Strike (09037, aggression event), Foiled! (09038, justice event), Iron Man (09039, leadership
 * ally). Reprints bundled in the same physical pack (The Power of Protection 09017, Med Team 09018, Energy 09022,
 * Genius 09023, Strength 09024, Avengers Mansion 09025) are aliased from Core by `../reprints.ts`, not scripted
 * here.
 *
 * Unflappable (09020): "Play under any player's control. Max 1 per player. Response: After you defend against an
 * attack and take no damage, exhaust Unflappable → draw 1 card." Was a skip pending an upper bound on trigger
 * results (`requireResults`/`eventAtLeast` are both minimums, "at least N"), landed with the wave B primitives
 * batch as `EventPattern.resultsAtMost` (docs/phase7-wave1-scripting.md §6): `on.defends(defender, {
 * takingNoDamage: true })` reads "and take no damage" as `resultsAtMost: { damage: 0 }` on the same deferred
 * `defended` window (RRG 1.8 "Defend, Defense" p. 16, FAQ "Unflappable (#20)" p. 60 — only the attack's own
 * damage counts, not a Boost ability's, which the deferred window's own results already reflect). Since the bound
 * is part of the trigger condition, not a nested effect check, the ability is never even offered (and its
 * `exhaustThis` cost never charged) when the attack dealt damage — matching the printed cost-arrow exactly, unlike
 * a `discardThis`-style workaround that would spend the cost regardless.
 *
 * Desperate Defense (09015) was a skip for the same `isAnnouncement`/`defended` engine bug until the 2026-09-15 fix
 * landed (`case "defended": return false;`, `packages/engine/src/trigger-events.ts`); it's scripted below now,
 * using `atEndOfAttack` (proven by Rhino's Charge) for its own "if you take no damage" half, which is a nested
 * effect-level condition inside one Interrupt, not a second trigger — unlike Unflappable, above, it never needed
 * the missing "at most" pattern operator.
