  // This is the scenario's entire win condition, so it is worth spelling out: Norman Osborn cannot be damaged at
  // all (his Forced Interrupt above turns damage into removed infamy counters), so the only way past him is to
  // strip those counters and flip him into Green Goblin, who can be damaged. Without these four abilities the
  // scenario has no reachable ending — the counters never arrive and the flip never fires.

  // Two abilities per face, because they are two mechanisms and an `AbilityDefinition` carries one trigger: a
  // forced response that places the starting counters, and a persistent `stateCheck` that flips both cards once
  // they run out (docs/phase7-wave1.md §3.4). The state check is edge-triggered and a first observation only
  // records, which is what lets the counters be placed by a response to the same entering-play event without the
  // still-empty card flipping itself first.
  //
  // §4.1's reading — the new face's "enter play with N counters" applies on a flip — is why the front face
  // listens for `cardFlipped` as well as `cardEntersPlay`, and why the back face (only ever reached by a flip)
  // listens for `cardFlipped` alone. Without it State of Madness would arrive empty and flip straight back.
