 * "Cards in another hero's deck" (`docs/custom-deck-testing.md`, "Cards in another hero's deck"): every Hulk pack

 * `hero:10001a` (an identity-specific card, RRG 1.8 "Identity-Specific Card", p. 23, only a Hulk deck could hold) —
 * played through the engine from a Core hero's own precon instead of Hulk's (`hlk-aggression`).
 *
 * Covered (12): 10011 Brawn, 10012 Sentry, 10013 She-Hulk, 10014 Drop Kick, 10015 Toe to Toe, 10016 "You'll Pay
 * for That!", 10018 Martial Prowess, 10019 To the Rescue!, 10029 Beat Cop (both abilities), 10030 Inspiring
 * Presence, 10031 Electrostatic Armor, 10032 Resourceful.
 * Skipped: 10017 The Power of Aggression (verbatim Core 01055), 10023 Avengers Mansion (Core 01091) and 10024
 * Helicarrier (Core 01092), all aliased in `../reprints.ts`; 10020-10022 Energy/Genius/Strength print no ability
 * (`abilities: []`); 10025-10028 are the obligation/nemesis/encounter cards, not player aspect cards. 10030's
 * "identity has the Avenger trait" gate cannot be shown refused: every Core hero has the Avenger trait.
 *
 * Seats: aggression cards in She-Hulk/Aggression, justice and basic in Spider-Man/Justice, leadership in Captain
 * Marvel/Leadership, protection in Black Panther/Protection (`CORE_HERO_FOR_ASPECT`).
