 * **A nemesis set never naturally enters play in this engine yet.** `createGame` (`engine/src/setup.ts`) puts each
 * identity's nemesis set into the *seated player's* `setAside` pile at setup — never into the shared encounter deck
 * — and nothing in `@mc/engine` ever moves cards out of `setAside` again (confirmed: no code path reads
 * `player.setAside` except the `CardSelector { kind: "setAside" }` a card ability could explicitly select from, and
 * no wave 1 pack's obligation script does). The real rule (RRG "Nemesis Set") shuffles a hero's nemesis set into the
 * encounter deck once that hero's obligation is discarded; that hookup doesn't exist yet, in Core or any wave 1
 * pack (`cap`'s own nemesis set has no test coverage for the same reason — see its `captain-america.test.ts`). This
 * is a cross-pack engine gap, not specific to `msm` or a reason to leave Ms. Marvel's own nemesis abilities
 * unscripted: they're correct DSL over well-proven primitives (§6 `cannotTakeDamage`/`blankTextBox`/`whenRevealed`
 * with `selectCards`), just not reachable through a real game flow yet. The two helpers below place/find a nemesis
 * card by reading `player.setAside` directly (test-only surgery, matching `patchInstance`/`moveToHand`'s
 * conventions), the way `game-rules-architect`'s own engine test suites use an internal `encounterInPlay` helper.
