 * Melee (05030, aggression), Concussive Blow (05031, justice), Morale Boost (05032, leadership) and Down Time
 * (05033, basic) are bundled in the physical Ms. Marvel pack but are **not** part of the 40-card "Ms. Marvel
 * (Protection)" precon `msm-protection` (`packages/content/src/data/msm/starterDecks.ts` lists only up to 05024) —
 * they're pool cards for a differently-built Ms. Marvel deck (a different secondary aspect, or a generic/basic
 * card usable by any deck). Reaching them through a *real game* the way the tests below do would need a second,
 * fully-built 40-card legal deck of a different aspect, which is disproportionate for four cards whose shapes are
 * already proven elsewhere in this exact test file (Melee/Concussive Blow mirror Big Hands/Tackle's
 * attack-with-conditional-bonus shape; Morale Boost/Down Time mirror Endurance's stat-modifier shape). This matches
 * `cap`'s own precedent: its four analogous off-precon pack cards (Enraged, Followed, Expert Defense, Enhanced
 * Awareness — `wave1/cap/pack-cards.ts`) have no dedicated tests in `captain-america.test.ts` either. They're still
 * scripted (not a "record and skip" gap) and exercised structurally by `coverage.test.ts` and `defineAbilities`'s
 * own validation at import time.
