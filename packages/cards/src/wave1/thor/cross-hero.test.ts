 * "Cards in another hero's deck" (`docs/custom-deck-testing.md`, "Cards in another hero's deck"): every Thor pack

 * `hero:06001a` (an identity-specific card, RRG 1.8 "Identity-Specific Card", p. 23, only a Thor deck could hold) —
 * played through the engine from a Core hero's own precon instead of Thor's (`thor-aggression`).
 *
 * Covered (13): 06011 Hercules, 06012 Valkyrie, 06014 Get Over Here!, 06015 Mean Swing, 06017 Hall of Heroes (both
 * abilities), 06018 Battle Fury, 06019 Jarnbjorn, 06020 Heimdall, 06021 Invulnerability, 06031 Under Surveillance,
 * 06032 Teamwork, 06033 Second Wind, 06034 Enhanced Physique.
 * Skipped: 06013 Chase Them Down (verbatim Core 01052), 06016 The Power of Aggression (verbatim Core 01055) and 06025
 * Avengers Mansion (verbatim Core 01091), all aliased in `../reprints.ts`; 06022-06024 Energy/Genius/Strength print
 * no ability (`abilities: []`); 06026-06030 are the obligation/encounter cards, not player aspect cards.
 *
 * Seats: aggression cards in She-Hulk/Aggression, justice and basic in Spider-Man/Justice, leadership in Captain
 * Marvel/Leadership, protection in Black Panther/Protection (`CORE_HERO_FOR_ASPECT`).
