 * Several cards here print byte-identical text to Wrecker's copy of the same card (`wrecker.ts`) — each is its own
 * physical card with its own ability id, so each gets its own registry entry, but the script bodies are
 * intentionally identical (never a shared reference across files: `docs/phase7-wave1-scripting.md` "a pack agent
 * never imports another pack's folder" extends to never importing across a scenario pack's own per-villain modules
 * either, so `wrecker.ts` stays readable standalone).
