/**
 * The sixteen leader-specific basic player cards of the Civil War box (MC56 p. 3: "These leader-specific player cards
 * are used only when playing in competitive mode"; docs/competitive-mode-plan.md sections 1.6, 2.1, 4 tasks 11 and 13).
 * The data marks them competitive-only and `validateDeck` refuses a cooperative deck that lists one, so none can be
 * seated in a real game. The tests run at the levels the engine allows, as `standard-pvp.test.ts` does:
 *
 * - registry: every ref registered once, valid, and the `competitiveOnly` sentences pinned;
 * - the cooperative guard: the exact refusal for each of the sixteen;
 * - two-team values: `yourLeader` and `enemyLeader` on the engine's two-team fixture;
 * - STAGED: this card cannot appear cooperatively. A card put into a hand by direct state arrangement in a real game,
 *   showing what the cooperative reading of MC56 p. 6 does: "the enemy leader" is the villain, "the enemy team" is the
 *   players, "your leader" cannot be resolved and "Do as much as you can".
 *
 * Missing from the engine, so not tested as a resolution: a leader attacking a leader, a leader scheming, a leader's
 * main scheme, redirecting an attack onto a leader (plan milestone M3).
