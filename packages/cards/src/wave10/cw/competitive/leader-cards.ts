 * the game has none; a sentence that needs something the engine does not have yet is a `competitiveOnly` marker.

/**
 * Competitive cards (docs/competitive-mode-plan.md section 4 task 11): the sixteen leader-specific basic player cards of
 * the Civil War box, four per leader (MC56 p. 3). The data marks them competitive-only and a cooperative deck holding one
 * is refused (`competitive_card`), so none can be played in a real game today. Every ref is scripted from the printed
 * text for when the mode arrives. Sentences the engine cannot yet run are `competitiveOnly` markers in the competitive
 * branch of `ifThen(inCompetitiveMode(), ...)`; each waits on plan milestone M3 (cross-area effects: the leader-versus-
 * leader attack, a leader scheming, a leader's main scheme, redirecting an attack onto a leader, a minion moving to
 * the other team's area).
 *
 * Cooperative reading, followed by every card (owner's answer to question 11 = A for the like case of Darkforce, 2026-10-11):
 * a sentence aimed at "your leader" does nothing, and the rest of the card resolves. So the leader attack events still
 * run their rider against the enemy leader (the villain): paying with the named resource confuses, stuns or strips it.
 * A Forced ability whose instruction cannot be resolved still triggers and its "Discard this card" still happens.
 *
 * Iron Man
 * - 56129 The Futurist: marker "Your Iron Man leader schemes. Do not give him a boost card for this activation."
 * - 56130 Target Lock: marker for the attack; "if you spent a [mental] resource" the discard of a Hero Response or Hero
 *   Interrupt attachment on the enemy leader (`abilityTiming`).
 * - 56131 High-Tech Suit: attaches to your leader (card data), counts as a Tech attachment (the Iron Man leader counts Tech
 *   attachments), Hero Action: spend [energy][mental] to discard it, any player may trigger it.
 * - 56132 Suit Up: after you spend it, give your Iron Man leader a tough status card.
 *
 * Captain Marvel
 * - 56133 Provoked Response: marker for the redirect and its 3-damage cap; discards itself.
 * - 56134 You Started This: marker for the attack; with [energy] paid, confuse the enemy leader.
 * - 56135 Alpha Flight Recruit: after energy counters are placed on your leader's Energy Channel, heal 1 from the ally.
 * - 56136 Raw Power: after you spend it, place 2 energy counters on your leader's Energy Channel.
 *
 * Captain America
 * - 56207 No, You Move!: attaches Cap's Shield to your leader (a no-op without one); marker for "resolve this attack
 *   against him instead"; discards itself.
 * - 56208 Fighting Dirty: marker for the attack; with [physical] paid, stun the enemy leader.
 * - 56209 Recruited by Cap: choose a minion engaged with you and a player on the enemy team; the minion engages that player.
 * - 56210 The People's Hero: after you spend it, give your Captain America leader a facedown boost card.
 *
 * Spider-Woman
 * - 56211 Double Agent: remove 2 threat from the main scheme; marker for "Place 2 threat on your leader's main scheme."
 * - 56212 Spider-Blast: marker for the attack; with [mental] paid, confuse the enemy leader.
 * - 56213 Hard to Hit: attaches to your leader (card data), gives her a tough status card as it enters play; Forced
 *   Response: after she attacks, 2 skill counters on her Finesse, then discard.
 * - 56214 Secret Contact: after you spend it, place 2 skill counters on your leader's Finesse.
 *
 * Wherever a card reads "Your <name> leader", the leader is the one on the player's own team; it is the only leader the
 * card can be in a deck with (the data's `specificTo` leader set), so the name is not checked again.
