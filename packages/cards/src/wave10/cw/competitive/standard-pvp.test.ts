 * record refuses the set, so none of these cards can appear in a real game. The tests run at the levels the engine
 * allows:
 *
 * - registry: every ref registered once per printing, valid, and the marker sentences pinned;
 * - the cooperative guard: scenario records, modular picks and the engine's mode refusal;
 * - two-team values: the script's own "players on your team" read on the engine's two-team fixture;
 * - STAGED: this card cannot appear cooperatively. A Core Rhino game with the card put into the encounter deck by
 *   hand, showing what the cooperative reading of MC56 p. 6 does ("the enemy leader" is the villain, "the enemy team"
 *   is the players, "your leader" cannot be resolved).
 *
 * Missing from the fixture, so not tested: a resolving ability in a two-team state (the fixture has no main scheme
 * and no card pool for Civil War cards) and the leader-versus-leader attack.
