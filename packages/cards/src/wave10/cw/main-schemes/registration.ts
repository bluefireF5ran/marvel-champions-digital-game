 * phase per player by the player who revealed it (`oncePerPhasePerEventPlayer`). **S.H.I.E.L.D. Recruits (56096b)**:

 * **Public Outrage (56122b)**: after step 1 of the villain phase, each player discards the top 3 cards of their deck.
 *
 * **Stage 2 B sides**: **Negative Zone Prison (56064b)** lowers the target threat by 1 for each card tucked under it
 * and tucks a defeated ally facedown (every card it tucks is facedown). **Hunting Rebel Heroes (56097b)**: each hero
 * gains Unregistered; a revealed card that gives heroes the trait deals them 2 damage (question 12 = A: every hero the
 * card's text reaches, a hero that already had the trait included; an identity in alter-ego form takes none).
 * **The Initiative (56123b)**: When Revealed, one side scheme for each player, from the deck and the discard pile.
