/**
 * The Civil War resistance main scheme (56141a to 56202b, docs/phase7-wave10.md sections 1.2, 2.6, 7.6; MC56 pp. 4-5):
 * one card of eight stages, a scenario choosing one stage 1 and one stage 2 by the id of their B faces. Every test
 * plays the real `resistance-spider-woman` scenario (`civilWarGame`: the Tigra starter deck, with `twoPlayers` the Core
 * Spider-Man deck beside it, seed 1, cooperative mode) through real commands. Only the encounter deck's order and
 * contents (`stackEncounterDeck`, `onlyDeck`) and a threat count are surgery. Spider-Woman's and the modular sets'
 * scripts are in the registry; nothing here depends on them beyond the cards named.
 *
 * The villain phase, with both heroes in hero form, is: step 1 (the main scheme's threat: 1 per player for the stage's
 * escalation, plus 1 for Self-propelled Glide's acceleration icon, 3 with two players); each villain activation
 * draws its boost card; then each player is dealt a card. Spider-Woman I attacks (ATK 2) a hero in hero form.
