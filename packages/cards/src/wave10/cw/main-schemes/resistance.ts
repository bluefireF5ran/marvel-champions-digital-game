 * treachery, 1 threat here, limited once per phase per player by the player who revealed it
 * (`oncePerPhasePerEventPlayer`). **Rallying Call (56199b)**: each minion gains guard. **Going Underground
 * (56200b)**: the enemy leader gains steady.
 *
 * **Stage 2 B sides**: **Secret Avengers (56142b)**: the enemy leader gets +1 ATK while attacking, +2 instead if the
 * attack is undefended (two modifiers, +1 and a further +1 when undefended). **Neighborhood Protectors (56173b)**: When
 * Revealed, one side scheme for each player, from the deck and the discard pile. **Guerilla Warfare (56201b)**: after
 * a status card is placed on the enemy leader, 1 threat here. **Superhero Jailbreak (56202b)**: after step 1 of the
 * villain phase each player discards the top card of the encounter deck, and a minion discarded is put into play
