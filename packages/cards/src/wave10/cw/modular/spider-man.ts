/**
 * Modular encounter set `spider_man_modular` (Civil War, Resistance side; docs/phase7-wave10.md sections 3.4, 3.21 and
 * 3.23). The boost icons and stars, Spider-Man's Avenger and Elite traits and Neighborhood Hero's starting threat are
 * data.
 *
 * **Spider-Man (56180)**: When Revealed: he attacks each character with Tangled Up attached, one attack per character.
 * "If no attack was made this way" is read off the attacks themselves (`attacks.hit.made`, the number made): none
 * when no character has a copy attached, and none when the attack was replaced, as a stunned Spider-Man's is (RRG 1.8
 * "Stun, Stunned", p. 41: the stun card is removed instead and he "is not considered to have attacked"). Then the
 * enemy team searches the encounter deck and discard pile for a copy of Tangled Up and deals it to you as a facedown
 * encounter card. The two copies are identical, so "the enemy team searches" has nothing to decide and no prompt is
 * shown (as for Unregistered Super in `cape-killer.ts`); the searched decks are shuffled after (RRG 1.8 "Search",
 * p. 39).
 *
 * **Tangled Up (56181)**: attaches to your leader, otherwise to your hero (`attachesTo` is data; cooperatively there
 * is no "your leader", MC56 p. 6). Forced Interrupt: when the attached character would scheme, thwart or attack, this
 * card is discarded instead (docs/phase7-wave10.md section 3.21; RRG 1.8 "'Would'", p. 48): the character is exhausted
 * if it paid that cost, and nothing else of the use happens. Boost: if the Spider-Man minion is in play, reveal this
 * card.
 *
 * **Spectacular! (56182)**: 2 threat on the main scheme. The competitive sentence is written out as a competitive-only
 * marker; cooperatively there is no "your leader's main scheme" and nothing is removed.
 *
 * **Neighborhood Hero (56183)**: in competitive mode, 2 threat moves from your leader's main scheme to this scheme
 * (written out as a competitive-only marker); otherwise 2 per player threat is placed here, on top of its starting 2.
 *
 * Cards (4):
 * - 56180 Spider-Man (minion)
 * - 56181 Tangled Up (attachment)
 * - 56182 Spectacular! (treachery)
 * - 56183 Neighborhood Hero (side_scheme)
