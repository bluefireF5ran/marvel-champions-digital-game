/**
 * Modular set `moon_knight_modular` (Resistance side) (Synthezoid Smackdown, MC57; docs/phase7-synthezoid.md section 8.3).
 * Retaliate 2 and Toughness (Moon Knight) and Hinder 1[per_hero] (Khonshu's Avatar) are data keywords.
 *
 * **Moon Knight (57065)**: When Revealed: resolve the "When Revealed" ability of the topmost treachery in the encounter
 * discard pile. Current text adds "(Limit once per phase.)" (RRG 1.8 errata; the printed card lacks it): the limit is
 * the ability's own `limit`, counted per card instance, so it also holds when another card resolves this ability
 * (`resolveSpecials`), where a limited-out step does not count as resolved (RRG 1.8 "Resolve", p. 37). Not a
 * reveal of that treachery (it announces nothing), but its incite and surge are When Revealed abilities and resolve
 * with its printed ones, in the order the first player chooses (RRG 1.8 "Simultaneous Resolution", p. 40; FFG
 * ruling, September 22, 2026; owner decision 2026-10-20,
 * revising docs/phase7-wave4.md §4 Q23; spec §S7 E37). Khonshu's Avatar (57068) resolves its treachery's the same
 * way. With no treachery in the discard pile nothing happens. "You" in the borrowed ability is the player revealing
 * Moon Knight.
 *
 * **Crescent Dart (57066)**: the attach sentence (Moon Knight, otherwise the enemy leader) and +2 ATK are data. Forced
 * Interrupt when the attached enemy attacks: that attack gains piercing and ranged, and the card is discarded at the
 * end of that attack (the Ahab's Energy Spear shape, `45099`).
 *
 * **Fist of Khonshu (57067)**: When Revealed: exhaust your identity and deal 2 damage to it (two instructions joined by
 * "and", RRG 1.8 p. 7: an identity that is already exhausted still takes the damage). Boost: exhaust your identity.
 *
 * **Khonshu's Avatar (57068)**: When Defeated: discard from the top of the encounter deck until a treachery is
 * discarded (it stops if the deck runs out, RRG 1.8 p. 17), then resolve that card's When Revealed.
 * "You" in it is the first player: the text names no player (RRG 1.8 p. 19), not the defeating player.
 *
 * Cards (4):
 * - 57065 Moon Knight (minion)
 * - 57066 Crescent Dart (attachment)
 * - 57067 Fist of Khonshu (treachery)
 * - 57068 Khonshu's Avatar (side_scheme)
