/**
 * Modular set `shield_ops` (Registration side) (Synthezoid Smackdown, MC57; docs/phase7-synthezoid.md section 8.3).
 * Patrol and Hinder 1[per_hero] are data.
 *
 * **S.H.I.E.L.D. Operator (57013)**: When Revealed: 2 threat on the main scheme.
 *
 * **Strategic Overwatch (57014)**: When Revealed: a tough status card on the enemy leader (the villain) and on each
 * minion. Boost: one on the activating enemy.
 *
 * **Rapid Response (57015)**: When Revealed: discard encounter cards until a minion is discarded (the match stays in
 * the discard pile). If the encounter deck empties first the search stops there, not continuing with the reshuffled
 * deck (RRG 1.8 "Encounter Deck", p. 17): nothing is bound, no threat or damage is dealt. In alter-ego form, threat
 * on the main scheme equal to that minion's SCH; in hero form, damage to your hero equal to its ATK. The minion's
 * printed stat is read as the card lies in the discard pile (no modifiers apply there).
 *
 * **Homeland Security (57016)**: the first minion revealed each round gains surge (anyone's reveal).
 *
 * Cards (4):
 * - 57013 S.H.I.E.L.D. Operator (minion)
 * - 57014 Strategic Overwatch (treachery)
 * - 57015 Rapid Response (treachery)
 * - 57016 Homeland Security (side_scheme)
