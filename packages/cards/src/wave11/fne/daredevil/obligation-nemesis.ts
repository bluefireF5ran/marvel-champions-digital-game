 * Wave 11 scripting module `fne/daredevil/obligation-nemesis` (docs/phase7-wave11.md §8.4 line 5).
 *
 * Cards (5):
 * - 60032 Sensory Overload (obligation)
 * - 60033 Bullseye (minion)
 * - 60034 Deadliest Man Alive (side_scheme)
 * - 60035 Stolen Sai (attachment)
 * - 60036 Eye on the Target (treachery)
 *
 * **60032**: "Give to the Matt Murdock player" is engine data (`obligationCardId`); the card stays in play. The Forced
 * Response hears any Sense upgrade entering play (put into play or played) and the Matt Murdock player takes 1 damage.
 * The Alter-Ego Response (optional) discards it after a basic recovery, as Hot-Headed (46024) does.
 *
 * **60033**: When Revealed, choose: discard a Persona support you control (offered only with one), or Bullseye attacks
 * you. A revealed minion engages the revealing player first; an attack is made against the identity in either form.
 *
 * **60034**: Forced Interrupt: when Bullseye attacks, he is given a facedown boost card (flipped in this attack).
 *
 * **60035**: "Attach to the enemy with the highest ATK" and +1 ATK are data. Attached character's attacks gain piercing
 * (an enemy or Elektra). Hero Action: spend two [physical] resources, choose to attach it to Elektra (offered only with
 * Elektra in play) or discard it. Boost: if the activation is an attack it gains piercing.
 *
 * **60036**: When Revealed, choose: remove an ally or Persona support you control from the game (offered only with
 * one), or Bullseye attacks you; "if he is not in play, find him and reveal him" is read as the attack's alternative
 * (he cannot attack from outside play), so with him in play he attacks and otherwise he is found and revealed, his own
 * When Revealed then resolving.
