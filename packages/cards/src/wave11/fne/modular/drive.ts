 * ability with one triggering condition met by either event (RRG 1.8 "Triggering Condition", p. 45), so one forced
 * "would" interrupt on `placeThreat` and `removeThreat` whose replacement branches on the kind of the event (RRG 1.8
 * "Replacement Effect", p. 37; "'Would'", p. 48).
 *
 * The character is the event's source: an enemy's scheme activation places threat as that enemy, and a basic thwart,
 * a "(thwart)" ability or a character's own ability removes it as that character. An unlabeled "remove N threat" on a
 * player's event card removes it as that card, not as the identity, so it is not replaced (engine interpretation,
 * authority step 5: no ruling names the character behind an event card's removal). Threat added to or removed from
 * Traffic Jam itself is not replaced (it is already "here"). The threat removed from here is removed by the player who
 * would have removed it (`by: eventPlayer`), and the replacement keeps the original's source and the thwart or scheme
 * activation it belonged to (`Frame<"effects">.replacesEvent`), so that thwart reports the threat and is credited
 * with a defeat. A removal that would be stopped (a crisis icon, patrol, a "cannot" rule) removes no threat and is
 * not replaced (`removalWillApply`). Removing more than is here removes what is here and the rest is lost: the
 * original removal does not happen. Traffic Jam's own crisis icon keeps players off the main scheme (RRG 1.8 "Crisis
 * Icon", p. 14), so a hero's redirected thwart is always one of a side scheme.

 * "instead" of revealing it (so none of its reveal happens, surge included). The player chooses which; with no
