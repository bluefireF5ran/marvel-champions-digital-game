/**
 * The Kingpin scenario (docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md section S7, task S12), built by
 * `wave11Scenario("kingpin", ...)` and played whole by the greedy driver (testing/driver.ts, which knows no card
 * names): Core's Spider-Man (Justice) and Captain Marvel (Leadership), standard mode, the Kingpin set with Tombstone
 * and Tracksuit Mafia.
 *
 * - The loss is a plain seeded game: Kingpin stays untouchable on his first side (no hero can damage him), so the
 *   driver can only wear the table down until the main scheme or the heroes give out.
 * - The win (2 players) starts the same game with Public Support at 2[per_hero]+2 counters and Kingpin one hit point
 *   from defeat. He cannot be hurt on his first side, so the game has to get through its first villain phase, where
 *   Public Support flips him and advances the main scheme to 2A (Endgame: every minion gains guard); the driver's
 *   attack after that defeats the villain on his final stage.
 *
 * Each game must end with no pending prompt, replay deep-equal from its log (`replay`) and command by command
 * (`sessionApply`), and run twice to the same end state.
