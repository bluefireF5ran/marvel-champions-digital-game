 * The Kingpin scenario (docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md section S6; MC60 p. 23, FAQ p. 26).
 *
 * **60159a/b, 60160a/b Kingpin (A1/A2, B1/B2)**: side 1 (both modes) cannot be dealt damage or have upgrades attached
 * and
 * schemes in place of every attack (Stalwart is data); side 2 (Steady is data) gives Kingpin 1 additional boost card
 * for an activation against a player not engaged with a minion, and in expert mode (B2) an attack that activation makes
 * gains overkill.
 * **60161a/b The King's Gambit**: Setup reveals each player's set-aside nemesis minion; one that shares a title with a
 * character in play (Echo's Kingpin) is removed from the game and that player finds and reveals an Underling instead
 * (the minion is removed, not discarded: MC60 p. 23, unlike the Unique Icon rule of RRG 1.8 pp. 45-46). 1B puts Public
 * Support into play, Low side up. Hero Action: remove 5 threat (4 in expert mode), shuffle the encounter discard pile
 * into the deck and discard
 * until a minion is discarded and reveal that minion. Completing the stage loses the game (data).
 * **60162a/b Endgame**: When Revealed: each player finds their nemesis minion that is out of play and reveals it; a
 * player whose nemesis minion did not enter play this way (in play, removed from the game, or not found) finds an
 * Underling and reveals it; in expert mode the first player finds and reveals Organized Crime. Each minion gains guard.
 * **60163a/b Public Support**: a Forced Response counts defeated minions; at 2[per_hero]+2 support counters the
 * villain phase's start flips Kingpin, advances the main scheme and flips this card to High (a flip reveals the new
 * face but is not a reveal of this card, so no When Revealed: docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md section S4.0).
 * **60164 Bear Hug**: "cannot change to alter-ego form" only matters in hero form, where it is attached
 * (`inForm("hero")`); the Forced Interrupt replaces a thwart or attack by the host with a grip counter lost, and Uses
 * (data) discards it with the last.
 * **60165 James Wesley**, **60168 Vanessa Fisk**: attach to Kingpin (data). Their Hero Actions pay with an event from
 * hand.
 * **60166 Kingpin's Cane**: Forced Response stuns the hero Kingpin damaged and discards the Cane if a status card was
 * given.
 * **60167 Mountain of Muscle**: Retaliate 1 to its host; absorbs the host's damage ("would take", so after a tough
 * status card, RRG 1.8 "Damage", p. 14) and goes at 8.
 * **60169 Black Cat**: owner decision Q205 = B (docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md section S4.1): she is an ally while she
 * has exactly 4 threat. The Hero Action puts the 4th threat on and takes control of her.
 * **60170 Diamondback**: 1 damage to the player when he attacks them, and as a boost. **60171 Spot, 60172
 * Stilt-Man**: "enters
 * play with N counters" is a Forced Response after entering play (as Core's Hawkeye). Spot sends an attack's damage
 * back to the
 * attacker while he has a counter; Stilt-Man loses a counter instead of taking damage while he has one (with none he
 * takes it: reading flagged to the rules expert).
 * **60173 Kingpin's Influence**: the defeating player puts 3 threat on their nemesis side scheme, or reveals it when it
 * is not in play (no threat is placed on a scheme that is not there yet: the printed order).
 * **60174 Organized Crime**, **60176 Unrelenting Hate**: as printed (an unfound nemesis minion is replaced by an
 * Underling).
 * 60163b's High-side Interrupt replaces the give of a facedown boost card to an enemy (`on.boostCardWouldBeGiven`,
 * docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md E23). **60175 Bag of Tricks** picks its card from the seeded RNG (`setAside`'s
 * `random`, E24).
