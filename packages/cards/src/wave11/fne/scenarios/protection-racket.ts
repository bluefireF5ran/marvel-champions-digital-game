/**

 *
 * Each player has their own main scheme in their play area (`Scenario.mainSchemeChoice`, chosen or drawn by `createGame`
 * from the 1A Setup text, so every 1A Setup script is empty). On a scheme "you" and "this play area" are its player's
 * (MC60 p. 13, `uncontrolledYouOf`). Every 1B ends with "If any main scheme is completed or any player is eliminated,
 * the players lose the game": the completion is the RRG's final-stage loss, the elimination a state check.
 *
 * **60134b Battle in the Bodega**: Forced Response: after a character in this play area is attacked (`characterAttacked`:
 * the target is the character actually hit), 1 damage to the attacker and 1 threat here; once per phase in standard mode
 * (a counter, see `BODEGA_USED`). A hero attacking an engaged minion triggers it too: the minion is in this play area.
 * **60135b Bull in a China Shop**: Forced Interrupt: when excess damage is dealt to an ally (expert mode: or a minion) in
 * this play area, that much threat here. Excess damage is how far the damage taken passed the character's remaining hit
 * points (RRG 1.8 "Excess Damage", p. 19), which is always a defeat, so it is read as the defeat's excess in the defeat's
 * interrupt window (`defeatExcessDamage`); a tough status card or a prevention leaves none (RRG 1.8 "Overkill", p. 31).
 * **60136b Hung Out to Dry**: Forced Response: after a character (an ally, or a minion engaged with the player) enters
 * play in this play area, 1 damage to it and 1 threat here. The hero never "enters play".
 * **60137b Pawn Shop Showdown**: the first upgrade its player plays each round costs 1 less (the round count, as Steve
 * Rogers' FAQ reads it, RRG 1.8 p. 59); Forced Response: after an attachment or upgrade enters play in this play area,
 * 1 threat here.
 * **60138b A Slice of the Pizza Dough**: Forced Response: after a character in this play area defeats another character or
 * a side scheme (in any play area), heal 1 damage from the defeating character and 1 threat here.
 * **60139 Shop Proprietor**: When Revealed: put into play under the revealing player's control and surge. Forced
 * Interrupt: when it leaves play, 4 threat on the main scheme in its controller's play area.
 * **60140 Man-Bull**: Forced Response: after he attacks, threat on the main scheme equal to that attack's excess damage
 * (the damage taken past the remaining hit points: RRG 1.8 "Overkill", p. 31). Boost: on an attack, the same once the
 * attack has dealt its damage (`atEndOfAttack`: a boost resolves before the damage), on the main scheme of the
 * villain's play area, i.e. each one (MC60 p. 13: a boost card on the villain is in no player's play area; one on an
 * engaged minion is in that player's).
 * **60141 Change of Venue**: Surge (data). When Revealed: swap your main scheme with a random set-aside one and place the
 * previous scheme's threat on the new one (`swapMainScheme`; MC60 p. 26 FAQ: the old scheme's attachments are
 * discarded). Boost: resolve this card's When Revealed ability.
