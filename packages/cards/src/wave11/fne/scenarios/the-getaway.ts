/**
 * The Getaway scenario (docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md section S6; MC60 p. 19).
 *
 * **60128a/b The Getaway**: Setup puts 1 speed counter on the main scheme (2 in expert) and attaches Out Front, found
 * in the encounter deck, to the villain (the deck is shuffled after the search, RRG 1.8 "Search", p. 39). Acceleration
 * 2 per hero, the 2/9 per hero threat and "if this stage is completed, the players lose" are data. The Forced
 * Interrupt "when the round ends, if there is threat here" is the main scheme's `while`; it places 1 speed counter,
 * then flips Alongside to Out Front (a flip, no reveal) or, with no Alongside in play, places 1 more. The two numbered
 * lines of that one ability parse as the stage's two constants, which are therefore empty (`constant()`).
 * **60129a/b Out Front / Alongside**: the "if there is no threat on the main scheme, flip this card" line is a standing
 * condition (`stateCheckFromEntering`), and the flip is a reveal so Alongside's When Revealed resolves (MC60 p. 19:
 * "This triggers the When Revealed effect on Alongside"). "[star] Attached villain's attacks gain ranged" is an attack
 * keyword grant to the villain. The Forced Interrupt is a "would be dealt" interrupt (before a tough status card, which
 * the villain keeps, RRG 1.8 "Damage", p. 14; MC60 p. 19), replacing the damage with the same amount of threat removed
 * from the main scheme, ignoring crisis icons as printed. It does not resolve while Jackknifed Tanker Truck is in play:
 * no damage is dealt, so there is nothing for it to replace (docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md section S3.5).
 * Alongside: each player takes 1 indirect damage and the villain takes 2 per hero damage.
 * **60130 Escort Vehicle**: Guard and Patrol are data; it gains toughness at 3 speed counters, quickstrike at 6, surge
 * at 9 ("also": the grants stack).
 * **60131 Jackknifed Tanker Truck**: Hinder 1 per hero and the crisis icon are data; "the villain cannot be dealt
 * damage" is `cannotTakeDamage` at the `dealt` stage, so no "would be dealt" or "would take" interrupt sees the damage.
 * **60132 Burning Rubber / 60133 Pedestrians**: once for each speed counter on the main scheme, the revealing player
 * chooses one of two options ("choose" with no one named is the revealing player's; each pass its own choice, RRG 1.8
 * "For Each", p. 20): spend 1 resource of any type or place 1 threat on the main scheme (the spend is offered to a player who
 * cannot pay it too, and pays what they can: RRG 1.8 "Choose (Option)", p. 12; owner 2026-10-20 reversing Q8); exhaust a
 * character they control (offered only while one is ready, which is the target) or take 1 indirect damage.
 *
