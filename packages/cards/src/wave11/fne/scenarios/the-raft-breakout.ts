/**
 * The Raft Breakout scenario (docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md section S7; MC60 p. 15, FAQ p. 26).
 *
 * **60142a/b The Raft Breakout**: Setup attaches Master Key (found in the encounter deck) to the villain, then each
 * player in turn discards cards from the encounter deck until a Prisoner minion is discarded and reveals it (the deck is
 * shuffled after the search, RRG 1.8 "Search", p. 39). 2 / 11 per hero threat, acceleration 1 per hero and "if this
 * stage is completed, the players lose" are data. Each minion gains a When Defeated that removes 1 threat from the
 * main scheme, 2 if the minion is Elite (`gainsAbility` to each minion, a granted When Defeated). A crisis icon does not
 * stop it on an encounter minion and does on an ally treated as a minion (owner Q209 answered A, 2026-10-19; RRG 1.8 p. 14).
 * The campaign's "tough status card / facedown boost card on each Prisoner minion" line is campaign setup (MC60
 * p. 15), not this card's text.
 * **60143 Master Key**: Permanent is data. Forced Response: each boost card of the villain's scheme activation that is a
 * minion is dealt to the player schemed against, facedown, after its Boost ability has resolved and in place of its
 * discard (MC60 p. 15: "resolve any boost effects as normal and then deal each such minion ... instead of discarding
 * it").
 * **60144 Absorbing Man**: tucks the top card of the attacked player's deck under him; +1 ATK for each different
 * resource type (printed; wild is its own type) on the cards tucked under him, the new card counted.
 * **60145 Baron Zemo**: the constant treats each ally with threat on it as a Deceived minion (`treatAsMinion`: SCH
 * from base THW, a blank text box, no consequential damage; read live, so the allies are allies again when he leaves
 * play and keep their threat, FAQ MC60 p. 26). When Revealed: the first player (RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 19) chooses
 * an ally without threat, 1 threat goes on it and it engages its controller. An ally Converted (60100) and Zemo both
 * claim is owner decision Q206 = A (docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md section S4.1).
 * **60146 Drang**: a barrage counter after each attack on the player, then indirect damage equal to his counters.
 * **60147 Mysterio**: as Master Key for the treachery boost cards of his attack on the player.
 * **60148 Proxima Midnight**: the attacked player chooses: 1 threat on the main scheme, or +2 ATK for this attack.
 * **60149 Rhino**: Toughness and Villainous are data; his attacks gain overkill; as a Boost he gives the activating
 * enemy a tough status card.
 * **60150 Imprisoned**: the holder's identity (not their allies) cannot thwart or attack, and cannot change to alter-ego form (which only
 * matters in hero form, as Bear Hug 60164). Hero Action: spend 3 resources of any type, or exhaust characters with a
 * combined THW of 3 or more (more than 2), to discard it. Boost: reveal it.
 *
