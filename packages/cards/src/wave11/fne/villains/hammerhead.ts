 * Hammerhead villain set (docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md section S6).
 *
 * **60086-60088 Hammerhead**: Toughness and Retaliate are data. Forced Response as `hammerheadResponse`.
 * **60089 Energy Gatling Gun**: Forced Response: after the attached enemy attacks, if the attacked character was
 * not defeated, discard this card as the cost; Hammerhead attacks that character again (a new activation's attack
 * with its own boost card, `enemyAttack` with `targetCharacter`). The cost needs the effect to be able to resolve
 * (RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 14): a defeated target leaves the ability unavailable and the card in play.
 * **60090 Hardheaded**: stalwart on the host; Hero Action (as Klaw's Sonic Converter); Boost: the activating enemy
 * gets a tough status card.
 * **60091 Chameleon**: +X SCH, X the highest THW among the other characters in play (`highestStatAmong`, H3.10).
 * He prints no THW; a character that does not print one counts as 0.
 * **60092 Maggia Enforcers**: Guard is data. Her SCH prints a star and is emitted 0, not a dash (RRG 1.8 p. 15);
 * "SCH is equal to" is a base set (`setBase`) over every Maggia enemy in play, herself included.
 * **60093 Maggia Underboss**: Villainous is data. Forced Interrupt: when it activates against you, if you are
 * stunned, 1 additional boost card for this activation (`modifyAttack.extraBoostCards` reads either activation).
 * **60094 Consolidate Power**: Forced Response: after a minion is defeated, it is given to the villain as a facedown
 * boost card. Printed as a response (unlike Dangerous Recruits' interrupt), so the minion has already left play
 * (discard pile, or the victory display for a card with Victory) and is given from there with `giveBoostCard`.
 * **60095 Power Struggle**: defeat the minion with the fewest remaining hit points (a tie is decided by the first
 * player, RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 19), discard from the encounter deck until a minion, reveal it.
 * **60096 "Head First!"**: Alter-Ego: surge. Hero: Hammerhead attacks you; if you are stunned (read before the
 * attack) he gets +2 ATK for it and it gains overkill.
 *

 * - 60086 Hammerhead (villain)
