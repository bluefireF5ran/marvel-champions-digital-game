/**
 * Wave 11 scripting module `jj/jessica-jones/obligation-nemesis` (docs/phase7-wave11-hero-packs.md H8.4).
 *
 * Cards (6):
 * - 61030 Work-Life Balance (obligation)
 * - 61031 Purple Man (minion)
 * - 61032 Indomitable Will (side_scheme)
 * - 61033a Suggestion (obligation)
 * - 61033b Suggestion (obligation)
 * - 61033c Suggestion (obligation)
 *
 * **61030**: the extra cost to change forms is a `formChangeCost` (either way, at any time). The Alter-Ego Action's two
 * "→" options are offered only while their cost can be paid (an ally you control; room for a confused card on your
 * identity), and the cost steps come first in each option. **61031**: SCH and ATK are bases that read the other
 * characters (HT5, H3.10; excluding himself is an engine reading). **61032**: Hinder 3 per player is data.
 * **61033a-c**: Uses is data; the card data gives its paragraph a `-constant` ref, which the coverage guard needs
 * registered, so each is an empty `constant()` (no behavior is invented). The play option is gated by `canPlayFromHand`
 * (RRG 1.8 pp. 12, 24): offered only while a card with that printed icon can be played and paid for.
