/**
 * Wave 11 scripting module `luke_cage/luke-cage/support-upgrades-allies` (docs/phase7-wave11-hero-packs.md H8.4).
 *
 * Cards (6):
 * - 62002 Jessica Jones (ally)
 * - 62007 Fogwell's Gym (support)
 * - 62008 Burstein Process (upgrade)
 * - 62009 Cruisin' for a Bruisin' (upgrade)
 * - 62010 Metal Bracer (upgrade)
 * - 62011 Power Man (upgrade)
 *
 * **62002**: +1 THW per tough status card on your identity, to a maximum of +4 (a bonus capped at 4, however many
 * tough cards Luke Cage holds). **62007**: the response answers a tough card discarded from any Defender character
 * (hero, ally or another player's), once per card (H3.2); it readies that character. **62008**: the "2 instead if he has
 * none" is read as the action resolves; Luke Cage can hold any number of tough cards (his identity script).
 * **62009**: the constant parts are the engine's HT10 rules, scoped to the attached minion; the response is
 * "after you play this card" (not "from your hand"), engaging the attached minion. **62010**: "When damage would be
 * dealt to Luke Cage" is a "would be dealt" interrupt (`wouldBeDealt`), so it is offered before a tough status card
 * (RRG 1.8 "Damage", p. 14, steps 1-2), and "reduce that damage by 1" lowers the damage dealt (`reduceDamage`), which
 * can leave 0 dealt and keep the tough card: ruling August 26, 2026 - Ruling 2 ("Metal Bracer interrupts when damage
 * would be dealt to Luke Cage, which can potentially reduce the damage dealt to 0"). Earlier rulings (June 25, 2026 -
 * Ruling 6; July 9, 2026 - Ruling 2, "Metal Bracelet" is this card) cover damage taken as a cost: reducing it to 0
 * keeps the cost paid. Luke's own unpreventable damage cannot be reduced (H3.3), so Bracer is not offered against it.
 * **62011**: exhausts, so several tough cards discarded at once (Augmented Jaws) draw one card (H3.2).
