 * its Setup side and 72B (OVERPOWERING) once flipped; the campaign instructions put one 72A into play under each
 * player's control.
 *
 * **72A** "If there are at least 5 corruption counters here, remove each of them from here and flip this card." A
 *   standing condition (`stateCheckFromEntering`, RRG 1.8 "Ability", p. 4): it also resolves the moment the card is in
 *   play with five already on it. The removal is first, so 72B begins with none (this is why the counters "survive the
 *   flip" only as far as the card's own text lets them).
 * **72A** "Action: Exhaust Creeping Corruption and place 1 corruption counter here -> draw 1 card." Both parts are the
 *   cost: the counter is placed even when it brings the card to five, and the draw still resolves.
 * **72B** "If there are at least 5 corruption counters here, you are defeated." The controller's hero is defeated
 *   (`defeat`: an identity's player is eliminated), the printed "you" being the card's controller.
 * **72B** "Action: Exhaust Creeping Corruption and place 1 corruption counter here -> draw 2 cards, then discard 1
 *   card from your hand." The discard is after the draw ("then", RRG 1.8 p. 44).
 *
 * Permanent, Setup, "Max 1 per player" and the OVERPOWERING trait are data.
