/**
 * Shadowland, the Dark Protege set (MC65, scenario 1; docs/phase7-shadowland.md section 6). The six villains' A sides
 * are scripted here where their printed text stands alone; Linked is data on the ten linked cards (M7).
 *
 * **65012a Archpriestess**: "After Archpriestess attacks you, give a minion a tough status card. If no tough status
 *   card was placed this way, discard the top 3 cards of the encounter deck, then deal 1 minion discarded this way to
 *   yourself as a facedown encounter card." Nothing prints "choose", so the first player picks the minion and the
 *   discarded minion (RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 19); only a minion that can take a tough status card is a target
 *   (one already holding one is not), and "placed" reads the status card actually given.
 * **65013a Daredevil**: after you or an ally you control attacks him, "choose: either discard 1 random card from your
 *   hand, or Daredevil attacks you" (once per round per player). The discard is offered only to a player with a card in
 *   hand (an option that cannot be carried out is not one to choose, RRG 1.8 "Choose (Option)", p. 12).
 * **65014a Elektra**: the top card of your deck is discarded and its printed cost read: odd gives +1 ATK, otherwise
 *   (even, zero, a dashed cost, or no card) overkill and piercing. The DSL has no parity value yet, so odd is the list
 *   of printed costs 1 to 15.
 * **65015a Gorgon**: choose to spend a physical resource, stun your identity, or take 2 indirect damage.
 * **65016a Lady Bullseye**: after her attack, 1 indirect damage if it was undefended, otherwise 1 threat on the main scheme.
 * **65017a White Tiger**: after she attacks you, she attacks you again with +1 ATK (once per round per player, so the
 *   second attack's own response is stopped by the limit).
 * **65018 Art of the Kill**: an enemy attacking you gets +1 ATK; if the attack defeats a character, 1 threat on the main
 *   scheme (read at the attack's end, as every "if that attack defeats"). Alter-Ego Action: spend one of each
 *   energy, mental and physical to discard it.
 * **65019 Krahllak's Blessing**: when the attached villain would take damage from a character, reduce it by 3, the
 *   villain attacks that character, discard this card. "From a character" is the character the damage's source acts
 *   for (owner decision 2026-10-20, docs/phase7-shadowland.md; RRG 1.8 "You, Your", p. 49): an identity, ally or enemy
 *   itself, the identity for an event its player plays or an upgrade it controls, labeled "(attack)" or not; never a
 *   support, a player side scheme or an encounter card, whoever owns it. An enemy source has nobody to be attacked
 *   (enemies attack players), so the damage is reduced and no attack is made.
 * **65026 Darkness Within**: change to hero form, the villain attacks you. Boost: an attack gains overkill.
 * **65027 Embraced by Darkness**: the villain schemes; if 2 or less threat was placed that way (none included), discard
 *   the top 3 cards of the encounter deck. Boost: an attack places 2 threat on the main scheme.
 *
