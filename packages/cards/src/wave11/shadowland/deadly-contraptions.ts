// RRG 1.8 "Choose (Option)" (p. 12) and the February 28, 2026 Spell Blast ruling (owner decision 2026-10-20, reversing
// Q8): an encounter card's option is barred only when it needs a target and has no valid one, and a target is valid only
// if the ability can affect it (RRG 1.8 "Target", p. 42). So Avoid and Disarm need a card in hand to discard (Disarm
// with fewer than 2 discards what it can and skips its "then"), Disarm needs a character that can take a tough card or
// an enemy, and Trip is offered to an identity that already holds the status (the damage can still be dealt). None of
// the card's targets says "choose", so the first player selects (RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 19).

 *
 * **Blinding Powder (65050)**, **Caltrops (65051)**: When Revealed: choose Avoid, Disarm or Trip. Disarm's second
 * part is a "then" (RRG 1.8 "'Then'", p. 44).
 *
 * **Hall of Punishment (65048)**, **Path of a Thousand Cuts (65049)**: the boosts only. The Forced Interrupts on
 * "choose the Trip / Avoid effect", Nervous Jitters and Iron Monk need an engine trigger for an option choice, see
 * the skip reasons.
 *
