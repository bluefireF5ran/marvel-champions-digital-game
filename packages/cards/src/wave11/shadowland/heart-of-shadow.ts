/**
 * Shadowland, the Heart of Shadow set (MC65, scenario 3; docs/phase7-shadowland.md section 6). Corruption counters sit on
 * each player's Creeping Corruption upgrade (`creeping-corruption.ts`); "your Creeping Corruption" is the upgrade in the
 * play area of the player the card speaks to. A player who has none cannot place a counter on it: an option that places
 * one is not offered to them, as RRG 1.8 "Choose (Option)" (p. 12) has it for an option with no valid target.
 *
 * **65057 Krahllak** (villain, stage A; Steady is data): "Interrupt: When Krahllak attacks you, you may place 1
 *   corruption counter on your Creeping Corruption. If you do, Krahllak gets -3 ATK for this attack." It is an optional
 *   interrupt, so the attacked player decides before a teammate declares a defender (insert FAQ p. 18, M11). The counter
 *   is placed, then "if you do" reads that it was.
 * **65064 Mark of the Wicked** / **65065 Pull of Power** (attachments): "When Revealed: You may attach this card to
 *   your identity. If you do not, take 4 damage, stun (confuse) your identity, remove 1 corruption counter ... and
 *   discard this card." Two options, the second the "do not". The Forced Response is the attached hero's own basic
 *   attack (basic thwart) and places a counter on the Creeping Corruption of the attached hero's player.
 * **65067 Hellbride** (minion): When Defeated, the defeating player places 2 counters, "then" heals 6 from their
 *   identity (RRG 1.8 "Then", p. 44). Hero Action: with 2 or fewer remaining hit points, exhaust your hero to discard
 *   her (a discard, not a defeat, so no When Defeated), then remove 1 counter from your Creeping Corruption.
 * **65069 Snakeroot Elders** (minion): guard and patrol while a counter is on her. When Revealed: "you may" place a
 *   counter on your Creeping Corruption, "if you do not" one goes on her (the same two options).
 * **65070 Veil of Nightmares** (side scheme): Hero Action: placing a counter on your Creeping Corruption is the cost
 *   (written as an effect, `costEffects`, so nothing resolves without a Creeping Corruption), then remove 5 threat from
 *   this scheme.
 * **65071 Submit or Suffer** (treachery): choose to place a counter, or remove one and the villain (Krahllak) attacks
 *   you. Boost: place a counter, or stun your identity ("you" is the defending player).
 *
 * Cards (7):
 * - 65057 Krahllak (villain)
 * - 65064 Mark of the Wicked (attachment)
 * - 65065 Pull of Power (attachment)
 * - 65067 Hellbride (minion)
 * - 65069 Snakeroot Elders (minion)
 * - 65070 Veil of Nightmares (side_scheme)
 * - 65071 Submit or Suffer (treachery)
