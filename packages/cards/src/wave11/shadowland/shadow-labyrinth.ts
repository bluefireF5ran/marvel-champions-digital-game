/**
 * Shadow Labyrinth (Shadowland, MC65; docs/phase7-shadowland.md section 6 rules briefs M3 to M6). The trap deck is
 * declared by the scenario (`traitEncounterDeck`); these cards only reveal from it and shuffle into it.
 *
 * **Into the Labyrinth (65038a, one pool card: stage 1 = printed 65038, stage 2 Chamber of Vile Secrets = printed
 * 65039)**: 1A's Setup builds the trap deck (the choice of the Dark Protégé villain and its linked cards is the
 * scenario setup's, `GameSetupConfig.villainChoice`). 1B places the passage counters and turns damage to Shifting
 * Corridors into threat removed from the scheme; the last threat removed advances the scheme (the card's gloss
 * "the players win by advancing" is flavor: the game continues at 2A and 2B against the chosen villain). 2A sets Shifting Corridors aside and reveals the chosen villain
 * ("side B instead in expert mode" is a flip of the freshly added villain, which reveals the face it turns to). 2B is
 * the lose-by-completion stage (`completionLoses` is data).
 *
 * **Shifting Corridors (65037)**: infinite hit points and Stalwart are data (M4). The Forced Interrupt replaces each
 * activation ("instead", RRG 1.8 "Replacement Effect"): remove a passage counter and the player the activation was
 * against reveals the top of the trap deck. The players lose when none remain (M5, a state check).
 *
 * **Lord Deathstrike (65041)**, **Dead End (65042)**: "If Shifting Corridors is in play" is a villain by that name.
 * Dead End's Assault is data (M6).
 *
 * **Hall of Hidden Doors (65043)**: "discard cards from the encounter deck until a minion or side scheme is discarded,
 * then reveal it" is `discardEncounterUntil` then `revealCard`.
 *
 * **No Time to Think! (65044)**: the villain activates against the revealer. Its boost adds two icons to its own count
 * and, for an attack, overkill.
 *
 * **Sudden Shift (65045)**: shuffles the trap discard pile and encounter cards into the trap deck.
 *
 * **Whisper in the Dark (65040)**: with Shifting Corridors in play, the set-aside chosen villain enters play engaged
 * with the revealer, side A faceup, with Whisper attached (`putIntoPlayAsHost`). The constant makes it an Elite minion
 * (`treatAttachedVillainAsMinion`): never "the villain", side A's ATK and SCH, 6 printed hit points (flat: the card
 * prints no per player icon), and its own text box kept, since the card blanks nothing (RRG 1.8 "Card Types", p. 12: a
 * card whose type changes "functions as would any card of the new card type"), so side A's star ability still answers
 * its attacks. It gains Guard, Villainous and the When Defeated "Set this minion aside", in which `self` is the villain
 * card: back to the encounter set-aside area, and Whisper, discarded with its host, goes to the trap discard pile (M3).
 * Whisper leaving while the minion stays (a player card discards it) leaves a villain card in play: it is one of the
 * game's villains there, beside Shifting Corridors (rules expert, 2026-10-22: a status change, ruling Dec 17, 2025
 * (1) #3; owner question 4, docs/phase7-shadowland.md §5.1, default built), and defeated as that villain it is out of
 * the game with no win (RRG 1.8 p. 15, p. 17; Grim Rule p. 4; owner question 8, same table, default built). The minion discarded is removed from the game: a Dark Protégé villain is
 * one double-sided card (RRG v1.8 "Double-Sided Card", p. 17). With no set-aside chosen villain to put
 * into play, Whisper has nothing to attach to and is discarded (RRG 1.8 "Attach To", p. 8). Otherwise Whisper is set
 * aside and the villain schemes.
 *
 * Cards (8):
 * - 65037 Shifting Corridors (villain)
 * - 65038a Into the Labyrinth / Chamber of Vile Secrets (main_scheme)
 * - 65040 Whisper in the Dark (attachment)
 * - 65041 Lord Deathstrike (minion)
 * - 65042 Dead End (side_scheme)
 * - 65043 Hall of Hidden Doors (side_scheme)
 * - 65044 No Time to Think! (treachery)
 * - 65045 Sudden Shift (treachery)
