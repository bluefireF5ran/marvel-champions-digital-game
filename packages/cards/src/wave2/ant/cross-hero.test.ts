/**
 * "Cards in another hero's deck" (`docs/custom-deck-testing.md`, "Cards in another hero's deck"): every Ant-Man pack
 * (`ant`, 12001a-12033) aspect/basic player card that has an ability script — every one whose own `aspect` is not
 * `hero:12001a` (an identity-specific card, RRG 1.8 "Identity-Specific Card", p. 23, only an Ant-Man deck could
 * hold) — played through the engine from a Core hero's own precon instead of Ant-Man's.
 *
 * Covered (15): 12011 Ant-Man, 12012 Giant-Man, 12013 Ronin, 12014 Stinger (play gate and ally-limit exemption),
 * 12015 Call for Aid, 12016 Moxie, 12017 Power Gloves, 12018 Reinforced Suit, 12024 Team-Building Exercise,
 * 12030 Moment of Triumph, 12031 Lay Down the Law, 12032 Muster Courage (and its Avenger gate), 12033 Assess the
 * Situation, 12020 Swarm Tactics (refused: Team-Up, RRG 1.8 "Team-Up" p. 43, the deck itself is illegal).
 * Skipped: 12019 First Aid (verbatim Core 01067), 12021 Energy, 12022 Genius, 12023 Strength (verbatim Core
 * 01075-01077 reprints aliased in `../reprints.ts`; the last three print no ability anyway); 12025-12029 are the
 * obligation/nemesis/encounter cards, not player aspect cards.
 *
 * Seats: leadership cards in Captain Marvel/Leadership, justice in Spider-Man/Justice, aggression in
 * She-Hulk/Aggression, protection in Black Panther/Protection (`CORE_HERO_FOR_ASPECT`), basic in whichever suits.
 * Every Core hero (hero face) has the Avenger trait; every alter-ego face but She-Hulk's/Cap's lacks it.
