/**
 * The `ant` pack's non-hero-specific player cards (docs/phase7-wave1-scripting.md §1's convention): Leadership
 * (12011–12018), Basic (12024, 12033), Aggression (12030), Justice (12031), Protection (12032). Verbatim Core
 * reprints (First Aid 12019, Energy 12021, Genius 12022, Strength 12023) are aliased by `../reprints.ts`, not
 * scripted here.
 *
 * **Previously skipped, now scripted (docs/phase7-wave2.md §18/§23):**
 * - `12024.team-building-exercise-action` — "play a card from your hand **that shares a trait with your hero**,
 *   reducing its resource cost by 1" is `playFromHandReducingCost` (§9, landed) with a `filter` built from
 *   `TargetQuery.sharesTraitWith` (§20.1, new) — `dsl/values.ts`'s `sharesTraitWith(ref)` wraps it. Both sides are
 *   read live through `traitsOf`, so a granted trait counts on either end (RRG 1.8 "Gains", p. 21).
 * - `12032.muster-courage-action` — "give up to X friendly characters a tough status card (to a maximum of 3),
 *   where X is the villain's stage number" is `chooseTarget`'s `count: ValueSpec` (`scaled(villainStageNumberOf(),
 *   { max: 3 })`) plus `upTo: true` for "up to" (at least 1; docs/phase7-wave3.md §4 Q16) — not `chooseCards.max` (the *out-of-play* selector), which
 *   the original skip named. docs/phase7-wave2.md §18.5.
 * - `12011.ant-man-interrupt` — "place 1 pym counter on him (to a maximum of 4) for each resource you overpaid for
 *   Ant-Man's cost" reads `overpaid.total` from the `cardEntersPlay` interrupt itself: `abilityFrame` merges the
 *   play's own payment vars into every ability frame for a card still on a `playCard` frame, so a later interrupt
 *   on the same card already sees them — the skip's claim that this needed a new primitive didn't hold up under
 *   a real command sequence. docs/phase7-wave2.md §18.3.
