/**
 * The `qsv` pack's non-hero-specific player cards (docs/phase7-wave1-scripting.md §1's convention): Protection
 * (14012–14017), Basic (14018, 14022, 14023, 14032), Aggression (14029), Justice (14030), Leadership (14031).
 * Armored Vest (14016) and the three basic resources (14019–14021) are verbatim Core reprints, aliased by
 * `../reprints.ts`, not scripted here.
 *
 * **Multiple Man's "search your deck and hand … shuffle your deck if it was searched this way" (14012) always
 * shuffles**, not only when a copy is actually found there: RRG 1.8 "Search" (p. 39), "If any portion of a deck is
 * searched … shuffle that entire deck" — the deck is always part of the pool searched (deck **and** hand), so it
 * is always shuffled, the same reading `searchAndReveal` (`dsl/effects.ts`) already established for an encounter
 * deck search that comes up empty.
 *
 * **Never Back Down's "if you take no damage from this attack, stun the attacking enemy" (14014) is a single Hero
 * Interrupt, not two abilities**: the `+2 DEF` applies immediately (before damage is calculated), and the stun is
 * queued with `atEndOfAttack`, resolving once the attack's final results are known — the same "defer a conditional
 * half of one Interrupt to the attack's own end" shape Sweeping Swoop's boost (01168, `core/heroes/spider-man.ts`)
 * already uses, reading `eventDealt`/`not(eventDealt(...))` off the now-finished `enemyAttack` event
 * (`currentActivationFrameId`, confirmed by `resolve/event.ts`'s own "`const event = withResults(frame.event,
 * frame.vars)`" for a deferred end-of-attack effect).
 *
 * **Vibration Resistance's "reduce the damage attached enemy takes from each attack by 1" (14027, nemesis) is a
 * Forced Interrupt + `preventDamage`, not a new `RuleSpec`**: RRG 1.8 "Prevent" (p. 35), "the damage is dealt but
 * not taken" for the prevented amount — mechanically identical to a flat reduction, and there is no card in the
 * pool (or precedent elsewhere) needing the two to behave differently, so no new primitive was requested for it.
