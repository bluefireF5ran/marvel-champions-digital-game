/**
 * Scarlet Witch / Wanda Maximoff (15001a/b) and her hero kit (15002–15009).
 *
 * **Chaos Control (15001a) — Interrupt: "When boost icons on an encounter card would be counted, discard the top
 * card of the encounter deck and count the number of boost icons on that card instead."** `on.boostIconsCounted()`
 * hears both counts the engine announces: an activation's boost step, and a card effect's own count
 * (`countBoostIcons`, docs/phase7-wave2.md §3.6, §4 Q8), which Hex Bolt, Molecular Decay and Warp Reality below make.
 * `replaceBoostCount` changes whichever count the interrupt answered.
 *
 * **Agatha Harkness (15007) — "look at the top 3 cards of your deck. Add 1 of those to your hand and place the rest
 * on the bottom of your deck in any order"** is three sequential player choices (keep one, then place each of the
 * other two on the bottom one at a time), not `EffectSpec.reorderCards` — that primitive's own `to` field is
 * hardcoded to `"encounterDeckTop"` (built for Heimdall's identically-worded "put the others back in any order",
 * `wave1/thor/local.ts`, which reorders the *encounter* deck's own top, not a player's deck at all), so it can't
 * reach a player's own deck, let alone its bottom. Two single-card `chooseCards` steps (rather than one two-card
 * step) make the player's choice of *order* an explicit decision point instead of leaning on answer-array order for
 * something the client isn't guaranteed to present as ordered (`chooseCards`'s own request has no `ordered: true`
 * flag the way `reorderCards`'s does). Not a primitive gap: every step is an existing, general-purpose builder, and
 * the result is exactly "you choose which of the two goes on the bottom first."
 *
 * **Chaos Magic (15003) — "Play a card from your hand, ignoring its resource cost. Discard cards … equal to that
 * card's printed resource cost"** needed one more step than `playFromHandIgnoringCost` (`dsl/effects.ts`,
 * docs/phase7-wave2.md §3.8) supplies on its own: that effect's own "which card" prompt never binds the card it
 * played (its internal `_play.*` bindings are cleared before the card enters play — `resolve/effects-frame.ts`'s
 * `executePlayFromHand`), so a later effect in the same ability has nothing to point `totalPrintedCost` at. Fixed by
 * choosing the card *first* (`chooseCards`, binding it to a slot) and then restricting `playFromHandIgnoringCost`'s
 * own candidate filter to `{ inSlot: "played" }` — the same "an already-bound slot as the only legal candidate"
 * idiom `wave1/{gob,hlk,twc,bkw,drs}/local.ts` use for a tied villain/scheme pick — confirmed to work on a *hand*
 * card because `playFromHand`'s own candidate list is filtered by `matchesQuery` directly over hand-card instance
 * ids (`resolve/effects-frame.ts`'s `executePlayFromHand`), never through `chooseTarget`'s own candidate function
 * (`selectTargets`, `cardsInPlay(state)`-scoped), which is the exact trap `wave1/drs/nemesis.ts`'s own docblock
 * documents for `chooseTarget`+`inSlot` against a hand card. **Also fixes a one-line docblock mislabel while
 * reading this primitive**: `dsl/effects.ts`'s own comment on `playFromHandIgnoringCost` cited this card as
 * "(Chaos Magic, `qsv` pack)" — Chaos Magic is 15003, `scw`, not a `qsv` card; corrected in that file's own comment
 * as part of this pass (a doc-only fix, no shape change).
 *
 * **Molecular Decay (15005)** reads "Deal 5 damage … and discard the top 2 cards … For each boost icon discarded
 * this way, deal 1 additional damage" as one combined `attack` (`scaled(<bind>.boostIcons, { plus: 5 })`), the same
 * "one attack for the base plus the bonus" reading Repulsor Blast (01031, Core) already established for the
 * identical sentence shape, rather than two separate damage effects.
 *
 * **Hex Bolt (15004)** — "Discard the top 3 cards of the encounter deck. For each card discarded this way that has
 * boost icons equal to: 0/1/2/3+, …" is `discardEncounterCards(3, { bind })` then a `forEachCard` over the discarded
 * cards: FAQ "Hex Bolt (#4)" (RRG 1.8 p. 61) — "resolve the first sentence of Hex Bolt entirely, without
 * interruption. Then, determine and resolve the appropriate bulleted abilities based off of what was discarded" — and
 * FFG ruling #106 (Oct 26, 2023) — "you can choose which order to resolve the cards discarded by Hex Bolt" (The Next
 * Evolution's extra icons end the moment it leaves play, so each card's icons are counted as its own pass starts).
 * `forEachCard` asks the player which waiting card resolves next, and each pass counts its own card's icons. "Place a status card on a character" names
 * no type, so it is scripted as a player choice among the three (RRG 1.8 gives no default for an unspecified status
 * card), the same reading `wave1/drs`'s Vapors of Valtorr already uses. Its four extra ability refs
 * (`.hex-bolt-constant` through `-constant-4`) are the parser's own per-bullet split (the same ingestion artifact
 * `qsv`'s Double Time and several `trors` cards carry) — `.hex-bolt-action` already carries the whole printed text,
 * so the extras are stood up empty (`coveredByEngineRule()`).
 *
 * **Scarlet Witch's Crest (15009)** is the card `adjustBoostCount`'s own docblock names as its motivating example
 * (`dsl/effects.ts`, docs/phase7-wave2.md §3.6) — "increase or decrease … by 1" is a `chooseOne` between the two
 * signed `adjustBoostCount` calls.
