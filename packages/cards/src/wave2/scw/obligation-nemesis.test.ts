 * Shuffle the rest of your set-aside nemesis encounter set into the encounter deck." Confirmed by inspection before
 * relying on it: it puts Luminous (15025) and The Next Evolution (15024) into play directly, and shuffles Magical
 * Suspension (15026) and Chaos Manipulation (15027) into the encounter deck proper — real content, not a synthetic
