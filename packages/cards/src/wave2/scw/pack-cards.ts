/**
 * The `scw` pack's non-hero-specific player cards (docs/phase7-wave1-scripting.md §1's convention): Justice
 * (15010–15015, her own precon aspect — Speed, Wiccan, Crisis Averted, Multitasking, Swift Retribution, Turn the
 * Tide), Basic (15018, 15019, 15031), Aggression (15028), Leadership (15029), Protection (15030). The Power of
 * Justice (15016), Heroic Intuition (15017), and the three basic resources (15020–15022) are verbatim Core/wave 1
 * reprints, aliased by `../reprints.ts` (confirmed against a throwaway `wave2ReprintPairs()` dump before writing
 * this file, per docs/phase7-wave2-scripting.md §3 — never assumed from the name alone), so they are not scripted
 * here; defining their ability ids in this module would throw `mergeRegistries`' "defined twice".
 *
 * **Order and Chaos (15018)** prints the identical text (down to the FAQ-settled internal reading it needs none
 * of) as the `qsv` pack's own 14018 — a genuine same-name/same-type/same-text duplicate, but `reprints.ts` only
 * aliases a wave 2 card against the wave 1/Core pool (`WAVE2_CARDS` vs `WAVE1_CARDS`), never one wave 2 pack
 * against another (`reprints.ts`'s own docblock), so this is hand-scripted here rather than aliased, identically
 * to `qsv/pack-cards.ts`'s own `14018.order-and-chaos-interrupt`.
 *
 * **Turn the Tide (15015)** — "Response (attack): After your hero thwarts and removes all threat from a scheme,
 * deal 3 damage to an enemy" reads as "your hero defeats a scheme by thwarting it": a scheme is only ever defeated
 * by its threat reaching 0 through a removal (RRG 1.8 "Side Scheme", p. 39), and `schemeDefeated.sourceInstanceId`
 * (§17.2, docs/phase7-wave2.md) already carries whichever character's thwart removed the last threat — basic or
 * "(thwart)"-labeled alike, both read `applyPlayerThwart`'s own `sourceInstanceId: event.thwarterInstanceId`
 * (`packages/engine/src/resolve/event.ts`). A raw `EventPattern` (`{ on: "schemeDefeated", sourceIs: { categories:
 * ["identity"], controller: "you" } }`) says exactly that, the scheme-only sibling of `on.defeats(source)`'s own
 * `["characterDefeated", "schemeDefeated"]` pair (§17.2) — Turn the Tide only ever cares about the scheme half, so
 * the narrower literal avoids also firing on an unrelated attack that defeats a minion.
 *
 * **Browbeat (15028)** — "Deal 2 damage … Deal X additional damage … (to a maximum of 3)" is one combined `attack`
 * (the same "one attack event for the base plus the bonus" reading Repulsor Blast, 01031, Core, and this pack's own
 * Molecular Decay, `kit.ts`, already use) with the cap applied to the bonus alone before the base is added:
 * `scaled(scaled(villainStageNumberOf(), { max: 3 }), { plus: 2 })` — `scaled`'s own `max` clamps *after* `plus`
 * (`packages/engine/src/select.ts`'s `"scaled"` case), so capping the whole expression at 3 would be wrong; nesting
 * two `scaled` calls caps only the inner "X" term.
 *
 * **Off-aspect cards, `toBeDefined()`-only** (`pack-cards.test.ts`'s own docblock explains why, following `qsv/
 * pack-cards.test.ts`'s precedent for the identical situation): Browbeat (Aggression), Last Stand (Leadership),
 * Bait and Switch (Protection) are unreachable from Scarlet Witch's own single-aspect Justice precon.
