/** The trait Expert Kang minions and Kang's Chosen search for/among (`packages/content`'s upper-cased spelling). */
const TEMPORAL = trait("TEMPORAL");

/**
 * The Kang encounter set (11014–11017, 11022–11029) plus its "Temporal" modular set (11030–11033, marked by
 * traits rather than a separate module — Temporal's own cards are few enough to keep here) and the four "Temporal
 * obligations" (11018–11021).
 *
 * **The Temporal obligations no longer combine two trigger kinds under one ref** (the pipeline split 11018,
 * 11019 and 11021 into their own "When Revealed"/"Forced Response" ref plus their own "Alter-Ego Action" ref, each
 * scripted below; the leading `.obligation` ref on each is a leftover empty artifact, `coveredByEngineRule()`).
 * **`card-data-pipeline` has since split 11020 (Depowered) and 11049 (Fear of Kang) the same way**
 * (docs/phase7-wave2.md §18.2/§18.3): each now carries a `-constant` ref (the "you cannot …" clause) beside its own
 * `-action` ref (the "Alter-Ego Action: discard … → discard this obligation" clause), so both halves can finally be
 * scripted independently instead of one ref forcing a choice between them.
 *
 * **11020 (Depowered) is now fully scripted, with one correction to §18.2's own shape.** `11020.depowered-action`
 * is `discardFromHandCost(1, 1, undefined, { identitySetOf: you })` (§19's cost-side `filter`) →
 * `discardThisObligation` — `you` here is fine, because `planCost` (§19) deliberately evaluates a cost's filter in
 * the *paying player's own* context. `11020.depowered-constant` is `RuleSpec cannotPlay` with `player: you` (scopes
 * *who* is restricted — fine, `rulePlayers` falls back to whichever player's play area holds the obligation) and
 * `cards: { identitySetOf: you }` — the printed text's own reading ("you cannot play *your* hero-specific cards").
 * `game-rules-architect` closed the gap this used to route around (docs/phase7-wave2.md §25.3): `cannotPlay`'s
 * `cards` query now matches with the rule's speaker as "you" (`ActiveRule.context`), not the source card's raw
 * (controller-less, for an obligation) context, so `you` resolves correctly instead of silently matching nobody.
 * `eachPlayer` was the
 * workaround while that gap stood; it produced the identical result in practice (RRG 1.8 "Identity-Specific Card",
 * p. 23: a hero-specific card can only ever be in its own hero's hand to begin with), but `you` is the narrower,
 * more literal reading of "you" and no longer needs a workaround to work.
 *
 * **11049 (Fear of Kang) is now fully scripted too** (docs/phase7-wave2.md §25): `RuleSpec cannotAttack` gained the
 * same `player?: PlayerRef` field `cannotPlay`/`cannotThwart`/`cannotChangeForm` already carried, so
 * `11049.fear-of-kang-constant` ("You cannot attack Kang") was `player: you`; it is now `attacker` the holder's identity
 * (docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.77, RRG 1.8 "You, Your", p. 49), so neither the other players nor the holder's allies are
 * restricted. `11049.fear-of-kang-action` (discard a random card from hand → discard this
 * obligation) is scripted below with `discardRandomFromHandCost(1)`, the same builder Magic Crowbar (`07018`)
 * already uses. `fear-of-kang-constant.test.ts` keeps the two-player proof: it still pins that a *bare*, target-only
 * `cannotAttack` rule (the shape Distracting Taunts, `twc` 07035, genuinely needs) is table-wide by design, and now
 * also proves the scoped shape this card ships with blocks only its own controller.
 *
 * **11021 (Time-Travel Hijinks)'s "When Revealed" half is now scripted** — `superlative`/`printedCostOf` (`dsl/
 * values.ts`, added this pass) supply "the highest-cost card you control" (a gap the module docblock previously
 * claimed had no primitive at all; `TargetRef { kind: "superlative" }` already existed for other packs, just not as
 * a shared `@mc/cards` builder — see `superlative`'s own doc comment).
 *
 * **11018/11019/11021's own "Alter-Ego Action" refs are now scripted too** (docs/phase7-wave2.md §19,
 * `ability-scripting-engineer`): `AbilityCost.discardFromHand` gained `filter?: TargetQuery`, the cost-side twin of
 * the effect's own `discardFromHand.filter` (Power Drain's "discard 1 resource of any type"). `discardFromHandCost`
 * (`dsl/abilities.ts`) grew a matching fourth argument. A wild icon never pays one of these — RRG 1.8 "Wild
 * Resource" (p. 48): "When resources are not being generated for a cost, a wild resource does not have any
 * characteristic other than 'wild resource'" — the engine enforces this directly, not this file.
 *
 * **Skipped (missing engine primitive — see docs/phase7-wave2-scripting.md):**
 * - `11029.when-revealed` — "Each player searches the encounter deck and discard pile for a **different**
 *   obligation and reveals it" is scripted below reading "different" as "this player's own choice" only: no
 *   primitive compares one player's pick against another's within `forEachPlayer`, so cross-player distinctness
 *   isn't enforced. Flagged, not silently assumed correct.
 *
 * **The Expert encounter set (11040–11051, scripted this pass)** substitutes for the Kang/Temporal set in expert
 * mode (docs/phase7-wave2.md §2.3). Every "[star] Boost: … Give this enemy another boost card" reads "this enemy"
 * as the card's own current activation, the same `modifyAttack({ extraBoostCards })` reading Hydra Exo-Soldier
 * (04131, `trors/red-skull.ts`) established — never `giveBoostCard`, which the validator refuses inside a `boost()`
 * ability for exactly this reason (docs/phase7-wave2-scripting.md §5). "Kang (Master of Time) activates against
 * you" (11051) is `enemyActivates`: it attacks in hero form and schemes in alter-ego form (docs/phase7-wave5.md
 * §4.1 Q67 — this previously read as always an attack, `absorbing-man.ts`'s now-superseded cycle-1 convention).
