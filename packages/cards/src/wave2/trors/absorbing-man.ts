 * The Absorbing Man scenario (`absorbing_man` encounter set, plus the Hydra Patrol modular set — no new cards of
 * its own beyond `trors/hawkeye-obligation-nemesis.ts`'s Hydra-nemesis pool): the villain (04076–04078), main
 * scheme "None Shall Pass" (04079), and his own encounter set (04080–04092).
 *
 * **Reading: "After resolving step one of the villain phase."** `on.villainStepResolved()` (default step
 * `"placeThreat"`, docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.2, engine event `villainStepResolved { step: "placeThreat" }`) is the
 * dedicated timing point for this: announced once, after step one's threat and its own windows have resolved,
 * before step two. Wave 2 originally wired None Shall Pass's Forced Response to `on.threatPlaced(mainScheme)`
 * instead, which fires on *every* threat placement on the main scheme from any source (a minion's scheme, Incite,
 * a card's effect), not once per villain phase — fixed per docs/phase7-wave3.md §5 / docs/phase7-wave3-qa.md
 * Finding 1.
 *
 * **Reading: "Absorbing Man activates against you"** (04078's `[star]`) is `on.enemyActivates({ categories:
 * ["villain"] }, { againstYou: true })` (docs/phase7-wave5.md §4.1 Q67; RRG 1.8 "Activation", p. 6): it fires on his
 * scheme against an alter-ego player too, not only his attack — this module previously read it as "attacks you"
 * (`on.villainAttacks`) only, matching every other "against you" phrasing in this pack (Mockingbird, docs/phase7-
 * wave2-scripting.md §6.6); that reading still holds for every OTHER card cited there, which print "attacks you"
 * rather than "activates against you".
 *
 * **Data gap flagged for `card-data-pipeline` (docs/phase7-wave2-scripting.md):** Omni-Morph Duplication (04089)
 * prints one "When Revealed:" line followed by four bulleted sub-clauses, but the data carries FIVE ability refs
 * (`.when-revealed` plus four more suffixed `-constant`/`-constant-2/3/4`) — the whole bulleted list reads as one
 * ability (a single reveal effect with four trait-conditional branches), so the four "constant" refs look like a
 * parser artifact that split the bullets into spurious extra ids rather than one that a reader would expect to
 * carry a genuinely independent constant ability. They're stood up as empty (`coveredByEngineRule()`) rather than
 * left unscripted, since `.when-revealed` already carries all four branches faithfully.
