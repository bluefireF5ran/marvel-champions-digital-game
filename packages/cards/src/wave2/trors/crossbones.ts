/**
 * Crossbones scenario (`crossbones` encounter set, plus Experimental Weapons and the "Three modular sets (Hydra
 * Assault, Weapon Master, and Legions of Hydra)" the 1A text calls for): the villain (04058–04060), main scheme
 * "Attack on Mount Athena" (04061), his own encounter set (04064–04071) and the Experimental Weapons attachments
 * (04072–04075). The data gap this docblock used to flag (`trors/encounterSets.ts` had no "Legions of Hydra"
 * `EncounterSet`) is resolved: `@mc/content`'s `TRORS_SCENARIOS` record now lists all three in
 * `recommendedModularSetIds` (`legions_of_hydra` is Core's own encounter set, wired in cross-pack — Legions of
 * Hydra's three minions print no cycle-1-specific text), and `../setup.ts`'s `wave2Scenario("crossbones", …)`
 * uses all of them by default (`options.modularSetIds ?? scenario.recommendedModularSetIds`).
 *
 * **Skipped (missing engine primitive):**
 * - `04058.crossbones-constant` (and `04059`/`04060`'s copies) — "While Crossbones has a Weapon attachment, his
 *   attacks gain piercing" IS scriptable as a conditional constant (`gainsKeyword` with `while: exists(...)`) and
 *   is scripted below — not actually blocked (an earlier pass over this text mistook it for the one-shot-event
 *   gap; a villain's own conditional keyword grant reads the villain's own keywords correctly).
 *
 * `04070.when-defeated` (Crossbones' Assault) was pinned pending a "player who defeated this scheme" `PlayerRef`;
 * the engine's `defeatingPlayer` primitive (docs/phase7-wave2.md §3) now covers it.
