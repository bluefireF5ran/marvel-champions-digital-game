/**
 * Criminal Past (04026), Hawkeye's obligation, and his nemesis set: Crossfire (04027), Marked for Death (04028),
 * Crossfire's Rifle (04029), Sniper Shot (04030).
 *
 * `04027.boost` and `04029.crossfires-rifle-action` were pinned pending engine primitives that have since landed
 * (docs/phase7-wave2.md §3): `AttackKeyword`/`modifyAttack({ keywords: [...] })` for the boost (see the ability
 * below for why no separate "if this boost resolves during an attack" condition is needed), and a `wild` slot on
 * `ResourceRequirement` for the Rifle's "spend a [wild] resource" cost.
 *
 * `04028.when-revealed` was pinned on a skip that had gone stale by the time of the audit
 * (docs/phase7-wave2.md §18.4): `anyOf` (CardSelector, landed for §10.1) unions the `zone` selector (hand/deck/
 * discard) with a `ref` selector over `each(query(...))` — the play area — into one pool and one choice, and
 * `tuckCards` already takes an in-play card out of play correctly (attachments discarded, RRG 1.8 "Leaves Play",
 * p. 27) rather than merely relocating the instance.
 *
 * "The Clint Barton player" is `eventPlayer`, checked rather than assumed: Marked for Death has no path into this
 * reveal at all except through Shadow of the Past (Core 01190, `core/modular/standard.ts`), whose own "Reveal
 * your set-aside nemesis side scheme and put it into play" is `revealCard(chosen("nemesisScheme"))` — default
 * player `you`, i.e. whichever player is *currently resolving* that copy of Shadow of the Past — over
 * `setAside(you, query("sideScheme"))`, which only ever finds a scheme in *that same player's own* set-aside pile.
 * Marked for Death sits nowhere else before this (RRG 1.8 "Nemesis Encounter Set", p. 30: set aside out of play at
 * setup). So the only way this ability's own reveal frame is ever created is when the player resolving Shadow of
 * the Past is the Hawkeye player — `eventPlayer` and "the Clint Barton player" are the same player by construction,
 * not by coincidence of a solo table.
