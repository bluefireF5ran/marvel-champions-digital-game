/**
 * Wave 3 §3.2's own docblock (docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.2, "Wave 2 bug found on the way") flagged this as a live bug:
 * three `trors` main schemes scripted "After resolving step one of the villain phase" as
 * `on.threatPlaced(query("mainScheme"))` (None Shall Pass 1B `04079b`, Hunting Down Heroes `04096b`, The Mad
 * Doctor 2B `04113b`) instead of the villain-phase-round-structure primitive built for exactly this wording this
 * wave, `on.villainStepResolved("placeThreat")` (`villainStepResolved { step: "placeThreat" }` in the engine,
 * docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.2, landed, commit `6ebb61f`). `on.threatPlaced` fired on *every* threat placement on the
 * main scheme (any source, any step), not once per villain phase.
 *
 * Printed text (Red Skull rulebook, spoiler edition, p. 10, Taskmaster's Hunting Down Heroes): "Forced Response:
 * After resolving step one of the villain phase, each hero must choose to either place 1 threat on Hunting Down
 * Heroes or take 1 damage." That is a single event per villain phase (RRG 1.8 "Round Overview" p. 4, "step one"),
 * so the Forced Response resolves exactly once per villain phase — RRG 1.8 "Forced" (p. 20): a forced ability
 * "must be triggered" by its triggering condition, which here is the villain phase's step one, not any later
 * `placeThreat` on the same card (Hunting Down Heroes' own "place 1 threat here" branch places threat on itself,
 * so on the old wiring it *retriggered its own Forced Response* the moment that branch was chosen; None Shall
 * Pass's delay counters and The Mad Doctor's test counters likewise accumulated on any threat placed on the main
 * scheme by any other source in the same villain phase, not only once).
 *
 * **Fixed** (docs/phase7-wave3.md §5): all three now trigger on `on.villainStepResolved()`
 * (`absorbing-man.ts`/`taskmaster.ts`/`zola.ts`). The tests below replace the earlier structural `test.fails` pin
 * with live, full-game repros of exactly the three properties the fix has to hold: fires once per villain phase,
 * ignores threat placed by another source in the same phase, and (Hunting Down Heroes specifically) doesn't
 * retrigger from its own "place 1 threat here" branch.

/**
 * BLOCKER — card script (owner: `ability-scripting-engineer`, card 04146 "Hydra Jet-Trooper",
 * `packages/cards/src/wave2/trors/red-skull.ts`): its Boost ability causes unbounded recursion that crashes the
 * game in ordinary, non-adversarial solo play, in *any* scenario that includes the `hydra_assault` modular set
 * (Crossbones and Red Skull both do — `packages/content/src/data/trors/scenarios.ts`'s `recommendedModularSetIds`).
 *
 * **Corrected diagnosis** — a previous pass at this same file blamed this crash on Crossbones' Assault (04070)'s
 * `whenDefeated` and the engine's `additionalResolution` trigger-matching guard (`triggers.ts:26`). That diagnosis
 * was independently re-checked and is wrong: `crossbones.test.ts`'s own unit test defeats 04070 in isolation and
 * passes cleanly (no recursion), and instrumenting `pushFrames` (a temporary `vi.spyOn` over
 * `packages/engine/src/ctx.ts`, removed after use) on both cited seeds (3001 and 4001) shows the actual repeating
 * ability at the moment of the crash is `04146.boost`, not `04070.when-defeated`, in both cases. 04070 is not
 * involved in the crash at all; the two are coincidentally similar-shaped card texts (both script an
 * out-of-sequence villain attack) in the same pack.
 *
 * Printed text (04146, "Hydra Jet-Trooper", minion, `hydra_assault` encounter set, quantity 2, star-icon Boost):
 * "Quickstrike.\n[star] Boost: If you are in hero form, the villain attacks you after this activation. Do not deal
 * any boost cards for that attack." Scripted (`red-skull.ts` `04146.boost`) as
 * `boost(ifThen({ kind: "form", player: you, form: "hero" }, enemyAttack(theVillain, { against: you })))` — a
 * plain `enemyAttack` with none of the printed text's two extra clauses applied: not "after this activation" (the
 * engine's `EffectSpec.enemyAttack.after: "currentActivation"`, `packages/engine/src/spec.ts` line ~818, "the
 * newly initiated activation resolves after the current activation has finished resolving") and not "do not deal
 * any boost cards for that attack" (`EffectSpec.enemyAttack.boost: false`, `spec.ts` line ~809, "'That attack does
 * not get a boost card' (Escaped Convict) / 'do not give the villain a boost card' (I See You)"). The `enemyAttack`
 * DSL wrapper in `dsl/effects.ts` doesn't expose either field, which is exactly why a `wave1/twc/local.ts` helper,
 * `enemyAttackAfterThisNoBoost`, already exists for the *identically worded* Escaped Convict (07009, "Surge. [star]
 * Boost: … If you are in hero form, that villain attacks you after this attack. That attack does not get a boost
 * card.") — `wrecker.ts`'s `"07009.boost": boost(moveActiveCounterToVillain("lowest"), ifThen(isHero(),
 * enemyAttackAfterThisNoBoost(theVillain, you)))`. 04146 needed the same treatment and didn't get it.
 *
 * Why the missing `boost: false` is exactly what recurses: 04146.boost resolves *while a boost card is being
 * counted for an ongoing villain attack* (`packages/engine/src/resolve/enemy-activation.ts`'s `stepBoostCard`,
 * `flipBoosts` stage). Its own effect starts a brand-new villain attack with no `boost: false`, so that new
 * attack's own `giveBoost` stage deals *it* a boost card too (Crossbones `getsBoostCard`, RRG 1.8 "Boost, Boost
 * Icon" p. 11: "the villain is given one facedown card from the encounter deck"). Confirmed by instrumenting
 * `pushFrames`: every single cycle re-deals and re-flips the exact same 04146 copy (instance `i70` in seed 3001,
 * `i71` in seed 4001) as that new attack's own boost card, whose Boost ability is Hydra Jet-Trooper's own — which,
 * in hero form, starts yet another un-de-boosted attack, forever. And independently confirmed causal, not just
 * correlated: patching *only* `04146.boost`'s effect in a throwaway `EngineDeps` (adding `boost: false` and
 * `after: "currentActivation"`, nothing else) made seed 3001 finish cleanly (a loss, 33 commands, round 4) instead
 * of crashing.
 *
 * Observed (unpatched): driving a plain, deterministic solo Crossbones game (`../../testing/driver.ts`'s
 * card-name-agnostic greedy player — no adversarial or hand-picked inputs) with seed 3001 succeeds for 31 commands,
 * then the 32nd command (a `resolveChoice`) returns `internal_error: flow did not settle at
 * villain/revealEncounterCards` (`packages/engine/src/flow.ts`'s `MAX_STEPS_PER_COMMAND` = 5000 safety valve
 * firing). Seed 4001 hits the same pattern at a different outer context (`villain/enemyActivations`). In an
 * 11-seed sample of otherwise-ordinary solo Crossbones games, 2 hit this (seeds 3001, 4001) — not a rare edge case
 * once Hydra Jet-Trooper is in the encounter deck and a hero is in hero form when it comes up as a boost card.
 *
 * Authority: the card's own printed text is the rule being implemented, and it already states the fix ("do not
 * deal any boost cards for that attack") — this is a card-script omission, not an engine gap or a disputed ruling.
 *
 * Fixed 2026-09-21: `04146.boost` now passes `afterCurrentActivation` and `noBoost` (`dsl/effects.ts`'s
 * `enemyAttack`). This was a `test.fails` until then; it stays as the regression.
