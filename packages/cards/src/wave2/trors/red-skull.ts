/**
 * The Red Skull scenario (`red_skull` encounter set, plus the required Hydra Assault/Hydra Patrol modular sets and
 * the Weapon Master modular set within them): the villain (04125–04127), main scheme "The Rise of Red Skull" →
 * "New World Hydra" (04128), his own encounter set (04130–04144), and the shared Hydra Assault (04145–04147, only
 * 04145/04146 are new — 04147 is a Core/wave 1 reprint), Weapon Master (04148–04151) and Hydra Patrol (04152–04154,
 * only 04154 is new) modular cards.
 *
 * `04141.when-defeated` (Prison Camps) and `04143.when-defeated` (Hydra Reinforcements) — both print "the player who
 * defeated this scheme," the same missing `PlayerRef` Crossbones' Assault (04070, `crossbones.ts`) was pinned for —
 * were pinned pending that primitive; the engine's `defeatingPlayer` (docs/phase7-wave2.md §3) now covers all three.
 * Test Subjects (04123, `zola.ts`) is unaffected — it names "the first player" explicitly, not the defeating player.
 *
 * **Reading: "Set The Sleeper aside, out of play"** (1A Setup) is modeled at the scenario-builder level
 * (`../setup.ts`'s `redSkullScenario`, `GameSetupConfig.setAside`) rather than as a scripted effect — the same
 * choice Taskmaster's Captive allies use (`taskmaster.ts`'s module docblock) — since it's equivalent to never
 * building the card into the encounter deck in the first place, and the engine's `setAside` config already exists
 * for exactly this.
 *
 * **Reading: "Interrupt: When a character thwarts this side scheme, they may use their ATK instead of their THW"**
 * (The Red House, 04139) is modeled as a *constant* `RuleSpec.thwartWithAtk` (docs/phase7-wave2.md §3.11: "The
 * Assault keyword [...] `RuleSpec thwartWithAtk` with `basicThwart.useAtk` is the Red House's optional version"),
 * not as a scripted Interrupt ability — the underlying primitive is itself a standing rule read whenever a thwart
 * against this scheme resolves, the same way `cannotTakeDamage` (this card's own first sentence) is a constant
 * despite reading like an ongoing prevention rather than a trigger.
 *
 * **"Forced Interrupt: when attached side scheme is defeated"** (Twisted Reality, 04135) was once scripted as a
 * `forcedResponse`, on the reading that it made no difference. It did: the attachment is discarded with its scheme
 * before the response window opens, so it never fired. `schemeDefeated` now has an interrupt window while the scheme
 * and its attachments are still in play (docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.37), and this is a true forced interrupt.
