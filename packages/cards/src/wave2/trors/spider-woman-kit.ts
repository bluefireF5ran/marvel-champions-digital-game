 * Spider-Woman / Jessica Drew (04031a/b) and her hero kit (04032–04039). Reprints in this pack (Combat Training,
 * Tac Team, Heroic Intuition, Interrogation Room) are aliased from Core by `../reprints.ts`.
 *
 * `04031a.superhuman-agility`, `04033.finesse-resource`, `04034.jessica-drews-apartment-action` and
 * `04044.piercing-strike-action` were all pinned pending engine primitives that have since landed
 * (docs/phase7-wave2.md §3): `TargetQuery.anyAspect` (`ANY_ASPECT_CARD`, `dsl/effects.ts`) for "an aspect card",
 * `AbilityLimit.per: "aspectOfEventCard"` for Superhuman Agility's own per-aspect limit, and `AttackKeyword`/
 * `attack(...).keywords` for Piercing Strike (the same one-shot-attack grant as Vibranium Arrow, `hawkeye-kit.ts`).
