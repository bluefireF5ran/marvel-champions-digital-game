/**
 * The Taskmaster scenario (`taskmaster` encounter set, plus the required Hydra Patrol set and the Weapon Master
 * modular set): the villain (04093–04095), main scheme "Hunting Down Heroes" (04096), and his own encounter set
 * (04097–04108). Hydra Patrol's own cards (04152–04154) are scripted in `red-skull.ts`, where the set is shared.
 *
 * `04093.taskmaster-forced-response` (and its identical copies on 04094/04095) were pinned pending an
 * `EventPattern` field to filter `formChanged`'s own `to` direction; the engine's `EventPattern.eventIs` and
 * `PlayerRef { kind: "eventPlayer" }` (docs/phase7-wave2.md §3.13.9) now cover it — `on.playerChangesForm("hero")`.
 *
 * **Captured by Hydra (04107) now carries its own `.when-defeated` ref too** (a later data pass split the two
 * printed triggers apart, the same fix Hydra Prison, 04122, `zola.ts`, already had two refs for) — both halves are
 * scripted below.
