/**
 * "Cards in another hero's deck" (`docs/custom-deck-testing.md`, "Cards in another hero's deck"): every Wasp pack
 * (`wsp`, 13001a-13034) aspect/basic player card that has an ability script — every one whose own `aspect` is not
 * `hero:13001a` (an identity-specific card, RRG 1.8 "Identity-Specific Card", p. 23, only a Wasp deck could hold) —
 * played through the engine from a Core hero's own precon instead of Wasp's.
 *
 * Covered (14): 13011 Thor, 13012 Wasp (ally; the constant and the overpay interrupt), 13013 Into the Fray, 13014
 * Surprise Attack, 13016 Boot Camp, 13017 Lie in Wait, 13018 Ironheart, 13019 Spider-Man, 13024 The Power in All of
 * Us, 13031 Running Interference, 13032 All for One, 13033 Perseverance, 13034 Athletic Conditioning, and 13020
 * Swarm Tactics (refused: its Team-Up keyword names Ant-Man and Wasp, RRG 1.8 "Team-Up", p. 43 — no Core hero can
 * include it, so it is shown refused at deck validation rather than played).
 * Skipped: 13015 The Power of Aggression (verbatim Core 01055) and 13025 Quincarrier (verbatim Core reprint), both
 * aliased in `../reprints.ts`; 13021-13023 Energy/Genius/Strength print no ability (`abilities: []`); 13026-13030 are
 * the obligation/nemesis/encounter cards, not player aspect cards. 13031's "identity has the Avenger trait" gate
 * cannot be shown refused: every Core hero has the Avenger trait.
 *
 * Every Hero Action (13013, 13031, 13032, 13034) is also shown refused in alter-ego form (RRG 1.8 "Action", p. 5:
 * "Hero Action" is form-gated; the pack prints no plain "Action:" card).
 *
 * Seats: aggression in She-Hulk/Aggression, basic and justice in Spider-Man/Justice, leadership in Captain
 * Marvel/Leadership, protection in Black Panther/Protection (`CORE_HERO_FOR_ASPECT`).
