/**
 * The `wsp` pack's non-hero-specific player cards (docs/phase7-wave1-scripting.md §1's convention): Aggression
 * (13011–13017), Basic (13018, 13019, 13024), Justice (13031), Leadership (13032), Protection (13033), Basic
 * (13034). Verbatim Core reprints (The Power of Aggression 13015, Energy 13021, Genius 13022, Strength 13023,
 * Quincarrier 13025) are aliased by `../reprints.ts`, not scripted here.
 *
 * **Previously skipped, now scripted (docs/phase7-wave2.md §18.3/§23):**
 * - `13012.wasp-interrupt` — "place 1 pym counter on her (to a maximum of 3) for each [energy] resource you
 *   overpaid for Wasp's cost" reads `overpaid.energy` from the `cardEntersPlay` interrupt itself: `abilityFrame`
 *   merges the play's own payment vars into every ability frame for a card still on a `playCard` frame, so a later
 *   interrupt on the same card already sees them, per resource type — the identical shape Ant-Man's own overpay
 *   interrupt (12011, `ant/pack-cards.ts`) is scripted for, `.total` there vs. `.energy` here.
