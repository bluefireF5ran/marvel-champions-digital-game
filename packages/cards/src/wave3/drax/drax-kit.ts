/**
 * Drax (19001a/b) and his hero kit (19002–19024). Two reprints in this range (19014 Counter-Punch, 19019
 * Indomitable) are aliased automatically by `../reprints.ts`, not scripted here — see docs/phase7-wave3-
 * scripting.md.
 *
 * **`19012.martyr-response`** ("Response: After Martyr takes consequential damage from performing an attack, if
 * that attack defeated an enemy, give her a tough status card.") — docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.44: the consequential
 * damage event now reports the basic power's own results (`attack.made`/`attack.defeated`) onto itself
 * (`pushConsequentialDamage`, `packages/engine/src/actions.ts`), so `after.consequentialDamage(who, { from:
 * "attack", defeated: true })` reads it directly. The response stays on the consequential damage itself (RRG 1.8
 * "Consequential Damage", p. 13), so the fresh tough status card arrives after that damage and cannot absorb it.
 *
 * **`19013.moondragon-action`** ("That minion attacks another enemy of your choice") — docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.23,
 * with §4 Q12 decided by the user (2026-09-23): an attack, not an activation (`enemyAttacksEnemy`). No boost card, no
 * defense, no "when this minion attacks" abilities; the minion's ATK is attack damage, so the target's tough and
 * retaliate apply and the minion's overkill spills a defeated minion's excess onto the villain (RRG 1.8 "Overkill",
 * p. 31). Guard does not stop it (RRG 1.8 "Guard", p. 21: a player's attacks only). The action needs a minion with
 * another enemy it may attack, else it has no valid target (RRG 1.8 "Target", pp. 42–43) and cannot be initiated.
