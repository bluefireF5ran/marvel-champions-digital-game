 * `basic`/`aggression`/`justice`/`leadership`-aspect filler cards bundled in the Drax pack, not part of his
 * signature hero-kit set (`aspect` is the generic aspect, not `hero:19001a`): "Bring It!" (19030, aggression),
 * "Think Fast!" (19031, justice), Regroup (19032, leadership) — the wave1 `cap/pack-cards.ts` convention. Gamora
 * (19020, `basic`) and Athletic Conditioning (19021, `basic`, reprint) are scripted in
 * `drax-obligation-nemesis.ts`/aliased by `../reprints.ts` respectively; Enhanced Physique (19033, `basic`) is
 * also a reprint, aliased automatically.
 *
 * **`19032.regroup-interrupt`** ("Interrupt: When an ally is defeated by an enemy attack, return it to its
 * owner's hand instead of discarding it.") — docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.45: `EffectSpec setDefeatDestination`
 * redirects a pending defeat's own discard, and `characterDefeated.fromAttack` (set when the defeating damage was
 * attack damage) lets `on.defeated(…, { byAttackFrom })` read "defeated by an enemy attack". The ally is still
 * defeated — When Defeated, Victory X and "after … is defeated" all still apply; only the discard is replaced.
 * Any player's ally, since the printed card does not say "your" (§4 Q17: an open reading against the Collector's
 * own discard redirect, `gmw/museum.ts`).
