/**
 * The Badoon Headhunter modular set (16183–16185): a minion (Badoon Headhunter, victory/villainous printed as
 * data, no ability ref for either — RRG 1.8 "Victory X"/"Villainous", pp. 46/47, are both reminder text for
 * constant engine rules already enforced generically) and two treacheries.
 *
 * **Modular, not campaign-only, despite living among the campaign-numbered cards (#178–187).** RRG 1.8 FAQ
 * "Modular Encounter Sets" (p. 61) lists Badoon Headhunter as one of the eight; docs/phase7-wave3.md §1.7/§4 Q3
 * (`card-data-pipeline`, 2026-09-22) confirms `EncounterSet.campaignSpecific` is correctly `false` for it —
 * neither it nor Campaign Challenge prints the "Campaign" word RRG 1.8 p. 11 defines as the marker. So it is
 * scripted here alongside the rest of `gmw`'s modular sets, not deferred with The Market/Campaign Challenge
 * (16150–16182, still campaign-mode-deferred per `wave3/coverage.test.ts`'s own `KNOWN_SKIPPED`).
