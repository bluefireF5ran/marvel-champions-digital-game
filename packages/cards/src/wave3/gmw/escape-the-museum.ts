/**
 * Escape the Museum: the mode-labeled Collector pair (16080a/16080b standard, 16081a/16081b expert; docs/phase7-
 * wave3.md §1.1), the main scheme The Missing Milano → Lost in the Museum → The Great Escape (16082–16084), Library
 * Labyrinth / Museum Ship (16085), and the treacheries "I Have You Now!" (16086) and Impossible Geometry (16087).
 * Galactic Artifacts and Ship Command's own cards are scripted elsewhere (`ship-command.ts`; Galactic Artifacts is
 * not reached yet).
 *
 * **The ∞ back faces (16080b/16081b) and the front faces' own flip (16080a/16081a).** docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.1:
 * the engine resets the hit point dial itself on any flip into or out of an `infiniteHp` face, so the back face's
 * own printed "…then set Collector's hit point dial to his printed hit points" is a no-op restatement of that
 * engine rule, the same reading `gmw/museum.ts`'s own Collector I–III docblock already used for a different
 * Collector ability. `cannotBeDefeated` (§3.1) is exact for "Collector cannot be defeated." even though it is
 * already unreachable by damage (`infiniteHp`) — it also stops a card-effect defeat (`EffectSpec defeat`, §3.9).
 *
 * **"Gets +X SCH and +X ATK, where X is equal to the main scheme's current stage number"** needed a new, generic
 * value (`ValueSpec mainSchemeStageNumber`, `dsl/values.ts`) — the main-scheme analog of the already-landed
 * `villainStageNumberOf`. No printed card before this needed the main scheme's own stage number as a value.
 *
 * **"When the last threat is removed from this scheme, advance to stage 2A/3A"** (16082b, 16083b) is printed as a
 * Forced *Interrupt*, but is scripted as a forced *Response* to `removeThreat` on self, checking the scheme's own
 * threat only once the removal has actually applied (docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.26's own reading for this exact
 * wording): advancing *before* the removal would apply "remove N threat" to the wrong stage's own threat total
 * (RRG 1.8 "Main Scheme": excess threat does not carry over on an advance, and the new stage's own starting threat
 * is placed immediately), and the removal must be confirmed to have actually reached zero (RRG 1.8 "Threat
 * Removal", the removed amount is capped at what's there) before "the last threat" is a true statement.
 *
 * **Known correctness gap, found while testing (not covered, and NOT in `KNOWN_SKIPPED` because the ref itself
 * resolves): "If this stage is completed, the players lose the game."** Unlike `gmw/badoon.ts`'s Protect the Planet
 * 2B (whose stage really is the scenario's *final* one, so the RRG 1.8 "Villain Defeat" (p. 47) default already
 * covers it), stages 1 and 2 of *this* scenario are not final, and the engine's own `completeMainScheme` default
 * for a *non*-final stage is to advance — so if this stage instead completes the ordinary way (threat reaching its
 * printed *target*, e.g. from step one's placement, acceleration and an Incite reveal over a normal round), the
 * engine currently advances it, when the printed text says it should lose instead. Confirmed empirically while
 * writing `escape-the-museum.test.ts`: an unpatched villain phase reached stage 1's target threat and the game
 * silently advanced to 2A. Every test below resets the main scheme's threat before running a real villain phase,
 * specifically to avoid this confound — it is not fixed. Fixing it needs a `whenCompleted` trigger (RRG 1.8 "When
 * Completed Abilities", p. 48: a forced interrupt to the completion, which can call `endGame("loss")` before the
 * engine's own advance runs, exactly like the `next === null` final-stage branch already does) — but the emitted
 * data gives this whole two-sentence text box exactly **one** ability ref (`16082b.the-missing-milano-forced-
 * interrupt` / `16083b.lost-in-the-museum-forced-interrupt`), already spent on the `removeThreat` response above,
 * and an `AbilityDefinition` carries exactly one trigger kind — `forcedResponse` and `whenCompleted` cannot share
 * one id. This is a `card-data-pipeline` gap (the two independently-triggered sentences need a second ref, the
 * same way Blind Side's `chooseOne` needed `partOf` bullets) or a `game-rules-architect` one (a compound-trigger
 * `AbilityDefinition`), not a wording question — flagged rather than guessed at.
 *
 * **"Set aside the Ship Command modular encounter set" / "shuffle the remaining … into the encounter deck"**
 * needed a new, generic `CardDestination` (`"encounterSetAside"`, `spec.ts`/`resolve/cards.ts`): `moveCards` could
 * already *read* the shared set-aside pile (`CardSelector encounterSetAside`, `gmw/badoon.ts`'s own Milano
 * pattern) but had no way to *send* cards there. Both directions bind a reference card from the set first
 * (Rogue Vessel, 16143 — any always-shuffled-in Ship Command card works) and match every other card sharing an
 * encounter set with it (`TargetQuery.encounterSetOf`, already generic and pack-agnostic) — no new `TargetQuery`
 * field for "belongs to a named encounter set" was needed.
 *
 * Library Labyrinth / Museum Ship (16085) were recorded as two more primitive gaps, both now closed
 * (docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.36, §3.38; docs/phase7-wave3-scripting.md §6d):
 *
 * - `16085a.this-way` ("Hero Action: Deal yourself 1 facedown encounter card → remove 5 threat from the main
 *   scheme. (Limit once per round per player.)") needed `AbilityLimit.per` to support a per-*acting-player* key.
 *   Closed by `AbilityLimit.per: "player"` (§3.36), the same primitive The Grand Collection 1B (16073b) needed.
 * - `16085b.hold-on-to-your-butts` ("Forced Interrupt: When
 *   the villain phase begins, choose one: exhaust the Milano → assign 2[per_hero] indirect damage among players;
 *   or assign 3[per_hero] indirect damage among players.") needed a primitive for a chooser freely splitting a
 *   pool of *indirect* damage across players. Closed: this is exactly `EffectSpec dealIndirectDamage`'s existing
 *   `to: "group"` form (RRG 1.8 "Indirect Damage", p. 24: "…dealt to a group of players (or among players) can be
 *   divided as the group chooses among friendly characters in play"), which had no card exercising it until now
 *   (§3.38). "As the group chooses" is submitted by the first player (docs/phase7-wave1.md §4.7); "choose one" on
 *   an encounter card naming no player is also the first player's (RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 19).
