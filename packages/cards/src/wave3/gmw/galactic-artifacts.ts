/**
 * The Galactic Artifacts modular set (16122–16130, one of the eight modular sets RRG 1.8 FAQ p. 61 names; required
 * by Infiltrate the Museum and Escape the Museum, MC16 p. 4's own "Contents" text for each). Five attachments
 * (16122–16126) and four identical-shell side schemes (16127–16130, each "Hinder 2[per_hero]. Victory 0. When
 * Defeated: the defeating player may …" — Hinder/Victory are data-driven keywords, §1.3/§1.6, no ability ref).
 *
 * **"Attach to the enemy with the lowest/highest ATK/SCH" (16122, 16124, 16126) is data, not an ability ref** —
 * `AttachmentCard.attachesTo: { kind: "superlative", among: "enemy", order, measure }` (`packages/content/src/
 * schema/cards/attachment-host.ts`), already emitted (`packages/content/src/data/gmw/cards.ts`). Same for "Attach
 * to your identity" (16123, 16125: `attachesTo: { kind: "yourIdentity" }`). Only each card's own printed Hero
 * Action (and Obedience Potion's stat penalty, The Poison's Forced Interrupt) needs scripting here.
 *
 * **"Any player can do this" (Obedience Potion 16123, The Poison 16125) is `triggerableBy: eachPlayer`.** The errata
 * (RRG 1.8 p. 66, "Changed reminder text to rules text") makes it card text, which takes precedence over the
 * attachment rule of RRG 1.8 p. 8 ("Only the player who controls the card to which that attachment is attached can
 * trigger abilities or pay costs on that attachment") by the Golden Rules (p. 4), as `triggerableBy` replaces it in
 * `useAbility`. The triggering player pays the cost,
 * so "Take 1 damage" is taken by that player's identity (`damageSelf`). Cloak of Hercules/The Beyonder's
 * Blazer/Vandarian Power Stone (16122/16124/16126) attach to an enemy, which no player controls, so any player may
 * already use them.
 *
 * **The Poison's "Forced Interrupt: When your turn begins" (16125)** is `forcedInterrupt(on.yourTurnBegins(), …)`. A
 * turn beginning opens an interrupt window before its response window (docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.46, RRG 1.8
 * "Interrupt", p. 25), and "your" on an uncontrolled attachment on your identity is that identity's controller (RRG
 * 1.8 "Attachment", p. 8), so it answers the attached player's turn only. "Take 1 damage" is `takeDamage` on that
 * player's identity (RRG 1.8 "You, Your", p. 49).
