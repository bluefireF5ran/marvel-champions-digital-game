 * - `16009.lashing-vines-response`: `on.basicPowerUsed` already covers a basic attack, thwart and defense with one
 *   subject role (§3.28); a defense's "after" window was also fixed to wait for the attack to end.
 * - `16024.deft-focus-action`: `reduceNextCardCost`'s existing `duration: "turn"` (§3.29).
 * - `16020.flora-and-fauna-action` (Team-Up (Groot and Rocket Raccoon); printed identically at 16048 in Rocket
 *   Raccoon's own card range, scripted there with the identical composition): naming "Groot" and "a Rocket

 *   `teamUpCharacters(i)`/`ofTeamUpSet(i)` (§3.34) — a Team-Up card can be played from either player's hand, so
