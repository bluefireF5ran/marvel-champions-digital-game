/**
 * Infiltrate the Museum: the villain Collector I–III (16070–16072), the main scheme The Grand Collection
 * (16073a/16073b), the Infiltrate the Museum encounter set (16074–16079), and the Menagerie Medley modular set
 * (16135–16137, MC16 p. 9's own recommended modular for this scenario, confirmed directly on 16073a's own printed
 * "Contents" text). 16075 (Monarch Starstalker) and 16136 (Servant Bot) carry no ability refs at all (Villainous
 * and Guard/Patrol are both data-driven keywords) — nothing to script for either.
 *
 * **The out-of-play area "The Collection"** (docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.14) is `createScenarioArea`/`{scenarioArea}`/
 * `scenarioAreaCount`, all landed in the engine; this pass adds the DSL builders (`dsl/effects.ts`'s `scenarioArea`/
 * `createScenarioArea`, `dsl/values.ts`'s `scenarioAreaCount`) that nothing in `@mc/cards` had exposed yet.
 *
 * **Collector III's own printed ability is one Forced Interrupt box** ("…instead, then place 1 threat on the main
 * scheme"), and only the active stage's own abilities apply (RRG 1.8 "Villain Defeat", p. 47) — so the redirect and
 * its follow-up have to be one ability id (`16072.collector-forced-interrupt`), not the redirect plus some other
 * card's own response to the announced `discardRedirected` event (the engine's own `scenario-area.test.ts` only
 * uses two cards to prove the event is independently usable). This needed a minimal, generic engine change:
 * `RuleSpec discardFromPlayDestination` gains an optional `thenPlaceThreat`, applied by `leavePlay` itself right
 * after the redirect, through the ordinary interruptible `placeThreat` event — see `packages/engine/src/abilities.ts`,
 * `rules.ts`'s `discardRedirectArea`/`mainSchemeForRedirect`, and `effects.ts`'s `leavePlay`, with its own test in
 * `packages/engine/src/scenario-area.test.ts`.
 *
 * **Biogram Image's "put this card faceup into The Collection →" is scripted as an ordinary effect, not an
 * `AbilityCost`.** No `AbilityCost` primitive exists for "move this card to an out-of-play area as a cost", and
 * unlike `exhaustSelf` (whose payability gates whether an *already*-exhausted card's ability may even be offered),
 * there is no state in which this attachment is in play, on the villain, with its Forced Interrupt active, and yet
 * unable to move itself to The Collection — so ordering it as the ability's first effect, ahead of the prevention,
 * produces the identical result to modeling it as a cost. Flagged here as a scripting decision, not a guess.
 *
 * `16073b.the-grand-collection-action` ("Hero Action: Choose to either exhaust your hero or spend 2 resources of
 * any type → discard 1 card from The Collection (to its owner's discard pile). (Limit once per round per
 * player.)") was recorded as a primitive gap — a true either/or `AbilityCost`, distinct from `cost: [a, b]`'s AND.
 * Closed by `AbilityCost.either`/`costSelection.branch` and `AbilityLimit.per: "player"` (docs/phase7-wave3.md
 * §3.36).
 *
 * "If this stage is completed, the players lose the game" (16073b's own second clause) needs no ability ref: The
 * Grand Collection is a single-stage main scheme, so completing it is completing the *final* stage, and RRG 1.8
 * "Villain Defeat" (p. 47)'s own default (a completed final main scheme stage loses the game) already covers it —
 * the same reading `gmw/badoon.ts`'s Protect the Planet 2B docblock already recorded for cycle 2's other 1B/2B main
 * schemes.
 *
 * **16077 (View the Cosmos) data note, flagged to `card-data-pipeline`:** its "Choose one:" block uses `-` bullets
 * (rather than the `•` bullets `01165`'s Eviction Notice special-cases into one `obligation` ref), and the raw data
 * carries two extra empty ids, `16077.view-the-cosmos-constant`/`-constant-2`, alongside the real
 * `16077.when-revealed` that already carries the whole "Choose one:" text — the same parser-artifact shape
 * `wave2/trors/absorbing-man.ts`'s Omni-Morph Duplication (04089) already worked around. Stood up empty below.
