/**
 * Nebula: the villain Nebula I–III (16088–16090), the main scheme The Art of Evasion → Warp Drive Initiated
 * (16091a/16091b–16092a/16092b), the Nebula encounter set (16093–16101: Nebula's Ship, the five Technique
 * attachments Cutthroat Ambition/Evasive Maneuvering/Unyielding Persistence/Weapon Mastery/Wide Stance, the side
 * scheme Lethal Intent, the treacheries Barrel Roll/Combat Ready), the Power Stone modular set's own card
 * (16149 — shared with Ronan the Accuser, scripted once here since this is its first scenario), and the Space
 * Pirates modular set (16138–16141, MC16 p. 14's own recommended modular for this scenario, confirmed directly on
 * 16091a's own printed "Contents" text). Ship Command's own cards are scripted elsewhere (`ship-command.ts`).
 *
 * **"Attach the Power Stone to Nebula" (16091a's own Setup text) is not scripted.** The Power Stone (16149) prints
 * the `setup` keyword and `attachesTo: { kind: "villain" }`, so RRG 1.8 Appendix II step 11 ("every card with the
 * setup keyword begins the game in play") already auto-attaches it to the villain, *before* the main scheme's own
 * Setup ability frames run (`setup-steps.ts`'s `putSetupCardsIntoPlay`, called ahead of the villain/main-scheme
 * setup-ability frames) — the same "explicit clause restates an engine default" reading `gmw/escape-the-museum.ts`'s
 * Collector docblock already used for the dial-reset text. Ronan the Accuser's own Setup text ("Attach the Power
 * Stone to the first player") is *not* redundant — a different host than the villain-default — and is scripted on
 * that scenario's own main scheme once it lands.
 *
 * **"Nebula initiates an activation against you"** (16088–16090's own Forced Interrupt) is scripted as
 * `on.enemySchemesOrAttacks("self")` with no extra "against you" filter: RRG 1.8 "Villain Phase" (p. 47) step 2a,
 * "the villain activates against the player" — a villain (unlike a minion) has no engaged player to filter by, so
 * every one of its own activations is already "against" exactly the player it is resolving against, and the
 * ability's own effects read that player as "you" through the ordinary encounter-card "no controller" binding
 * (`resolve/triggers.ts`'s `matchesPattern`): matching `playerIs: "controller"` with no explicit `usesAttackedPlayer`
 * scoping would be a no-op filter here, so it is omitted rather than written for no effect.
 *
 * **The Power Stone's Forced Response** is `on.damage("host", { fromAttack: true, dealt: 3 })`: "deals
 * 3 or more damage … with a single attack" is damage **dealt** (RRG 1.8 "Prevent", p. 35; owner ruling 2026-10-07,
 * docs/dealt-vs-taken-audit.md), so the stone moves when a tough status card or a prevention kept the attached
 * character from taking it. The shape `packages/engine/src/power-stone.test.ts` (docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.19) proves.
 *
 * **DSL builders added this pass:** `resolveSpecialsOf` (`dsl/effects.ts`) — the engine's `resolveSpecials` already
 * carried an `of: TargetRef` field (a card named directly, not found by query) for exactly this shape, needed
 * because a Technique attachment is not unique (`quantityInSet: 2` on two of the five), so "resolve *its* Special
 * ability" after attaching it (the five Technique's own Boost body) has to name the specific instance, not "any
 * Technique in play" (which could resolve a different, already-attached copy of the same card). `spendUpTo`
 * (`dsl/abilities.ts`) — the engine's `AbilityCost.resourcesX` already supported `resource: "any"` with a `max`
 * and no `min` (docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.25, built for this very card, Nebula's Ship's own "Shoot the Thrusters!"),
 * with no DSL wrapper yet; `spendX` is the wrong shape (a single named type, `min` defaulting to 1).
 *
 * No genuine primitive gaps this pass: every `gmw` primitive Nebula needs (§3.2, §3.7, §3.8, §3.13, §3.15, §3.19,
 * §3.25) had already landed for `stld`/`gam`/`vnm` before this session began.
