/**
 * Ronan the Accuser (docs/phase7-wave3.md §2.2): the villain Ronan the Accuser I–III, the main scheme Interception
 * Imminent → "Take What Is Mine", Kree Command Ship, Universal Weapon, Fanaticism, the side schemes Cut the Power/
 * Pincer Maneuver/Superior Tactics, the treacheries Single-Minded Fury/Kree Physiology/"You Stand Accused!", and
 * the Kree Militants modular set. `16114.when-revealed` and `16131.kree-combat-armor-action` (once the last two
 * genuine primitive gaps this pack had, `gmw/ronan.ts`'s own module docblock) are now scripted too, per
 * docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.39/§3.40/§3.43.
 *
 * **Traps hit writing this file, beyond the standing ones in docs/card-scripting-process.md §7:**
 *
 * - **Ronan's own printed "Toughness" keyword gives him a tough status card at setup** (RRG 1.8 "Toughness", p.
 *   45: enters play with one already on). A test that primes his damage dial and lands one small attack, expecting
 *   a kill, silently does nothing until the tough card is cleared first (it absorbs the whole hit instead).
 * - **The Power Stone starts attached to the first player's identity** (16106a's own Setup text), so "you control
 *   the Power Stone" — and the Forced Interrupt's extra boost card — is already *true* in the default post-setup
 *   state. Any test staging a specific card as *the* boost card for Ronan's own activation has to move the stone
 *   off the identity first (`withoutPowerStoneControl`), or the extra boost card silently consumes the staged
 *   card as a second, unplanned boost draw instead of leaving it to be dealt and revealed normally — the same
 *   "villain deals more than one boost card" trap `gmw/badoon.ts`'s own §6c note names, just triggered by this
 *   scenario's own printed setup rather than a card in play.
 * - **A boost card "given" outside an activation (`giveBoostCard`) is consumed by the very next activation of that
 *   enemy, in the same villain phase.** 2A's own "give him 1 facedown boost card" is confirmed via the
 *   `boostCardDealt { outsideActivation: true }` event, not via a post-villain-phase `boostCards.length` check —
 *   by the time a full phase finishes, Ronan's own activation has already flipped and discarded it.
 * - **An ability id is only active on the main scheme stage that prints it.** 16106b (1B's own First Player
 *   Action) does not exist once the main scheme has advanced to 2B (16107b) — testing "threat cannot be removed"
 *   at stage 2 needs the engine's own `threatCannotBeRemoved` rule check directly, not a `useAbility` call to an
 *   ability id that stage no longer carries.
