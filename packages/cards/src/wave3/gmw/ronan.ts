/**
 * Ronan the Accuser: the villain Ronan the Accuser I–III (16103–16105), the main scheme Interception Imminent →
 * "Take What Is Mine" (16106–16107), Kree Command Ship (16108), Universal Weapon (16109), Fanaticism (16110), the
 * side schemes Cut the Power/Pincer Maneuver/Superior Tactics (16111–16113), the treacheries Single-Minded Fury/
 * Kree Physiology/"You Stand Accused!" (16114–16116), and the Kree Militants modular set (16131–16134). Power Stone
 * (16149, shared with Nebula) is scripted in `nebula.ts`, where it landed first.
 *
 * **"Attach the Power Stone to the first player" (16106a's own Setup text) is not redundant.** Unlike Nebula's own
 * Setup text (`gmw/nebula.ts`'s own docblock), the Power Stone's `setup` keyword only auto-attaches it to *the
 * villain* by default (RRG 1.8 Appendix II step 11) — Ronan's own Setup text moves it again, to the first player's
 * identity, which `attachCard` does regardless of the stone's current host.
 *
 * **"Ronan the Accuser activates against you, give him 1 additional boost card if you control the Power Stone"**
 * (16103–16105, identical text on all three stages): "you" is the villain-phase player the activation concerns —
 * the same reading `gmw/nebula.ts`'s own Forced Interrupt docblock uses for the same shape — and "you control the
 * Power Stone" is read as "the Power Stone is attached to your identity" (docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.19, §4 Q11:
 * encounter cards are controlled by the scenario, RRG 1.8 "Ownership and Control" p. 31, so the printed "control"
 * has to mean the attachment relationship MC16 p. 15's own campaign text uses the same wording for).
 *
 * **`16114.when-revealed`** ("Ronan the Accuser attacks the player who controls the Power Stone (even if that
 * player is in alter-ego form). If no attack was made this way, this card gains surge.") — docs/phase7-wave3.md
 * §3.39/§3.40, §4 Q11: "controls the Power Stone" is "the Power Stone is attached to that player's identity",
 * `controllerOf(each(query("identity", hasAttachment({ name: "Power Stone" }))))`. With the stone on the villain
 * (an encounter card, controlled by the scenario, RRG 1.8 "Ownership and Control" p. 31) the ref names nobody,
 * `enemyAttack` makes no attack against an empty `against`, and the card's own sentence gives the surge.
 *
 * **`16131.kree-combat-armor-action`** ("Hero Action: Spend 3 resources of the same type → discard this card.") —
 * docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.43: `AbilityCost.sameResourceType` (`spendSameType(3)`), the payer's choice of type, a
 * wild counting as any type.
