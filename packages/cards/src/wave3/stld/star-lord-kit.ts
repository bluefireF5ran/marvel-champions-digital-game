 * lists are offered for every player deck, so the choice gives away nothing about what that hidden deck holds. The
 * encounter deck offers the encounter types, environment included.

 *   `EffectSpec divide`'s new `upTo: true` lets the chooser divide fewer than the computed amount, but at least 1

 *   docs/phase7-wave2.md §3.7's own Inconspicuous/Wasp Sting, which print "a total of N" with no "up to").
 * - `17005.sliding-shot-constant` ("Play only if you control an Element Gun") — `constant.playOnlyIf`, read from
 *   the card being played wherever it is (not the in-play-only `activeRules`/`activeAbilityRefs` a bare
