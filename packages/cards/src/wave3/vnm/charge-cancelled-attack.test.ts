/**
 * Rhino's Charge (01099) against Venom's Grasping Tendrils (20003): an "at the end of this attack" delayed effect whose
 * attack is cancelled in the same "when the villain attacks" window.
 *
 * Charge: "Forced Interrupt: When Rhino attacks, the attack gains overkill. At the end of this attack, discard
 * Charge." Grasping Tendrils: "Hero Interrupt (defense): When the villain initiates an attack against you, cancel that
 * attack. If you paid for this card using only [physical] resources, stun the villain." The two share a window (RRG 1.8
 * "Attack (Enemy Activation)", p. 9: "when [enemy name] attacks" has the timing of "when [the villain] initiates an
 * attack") and the forced one resolves first, so Charge's delayed effect exists when the attack is cancelled.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Cancel" (p. 11): the cancelled effect is "replaced with no effect" and "is not considered to have
 * occurred". "Delayed Effect" (p. 16): a delayed effect resolves "immediately after [its] specified timing point".
 * An attack that did not occur has no end, so Charge is not discarded and waits for Rhino's next attack. No ruling
 * found addresses it (the ruling of January 11, 2026 - Ruling 1, answer 3 is about an attacker that left play, whose
 * attack did end).
