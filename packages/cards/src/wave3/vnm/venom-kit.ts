/**
 * Venom / Flash Thompson (20001a/b) and his hero kit (20002–20022, 20026–20029). Reprints in this pack — The
 * Power of Justice (20014, verbatim Core 01062) and Resourceful (20020, verbatim reprint) — are aliased
 * automatically by `../reprints.ts`, not scripted here.
 *
 * **Errata/FAQ checked:** none of 20001–20029 carries current errata (`pnpm card` shows no `!! ERRATA` for any of
 * them); the printed text transcribed from `packages/content/src/data/vnm/cards.ts` is the current legal text.
 *
 * **No genuine primitive gaps in the kit.** Every ability composes from existing DSL vocabulary, plus three small
 * additive DSL wrappers this pass needed and added generically (no engine change, in `dsl/values.ts`/`dsl/
 * abilities.ts`/`dsl/effects.ts` respectively):
 * - `paidWithOnly` — the engine `Predicate` already existed (wave 2's own play-restrictions test), with no DSL
 *   builder; "If you paid for this card using only [X] resources" (Behind Enemy Lines, Grasping Tendrils, Savage
 *   Attack) needed it.
 * - `restrictedLimit` — docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.22's `RuleSpec`, landed in the engine with no DSL wrapper yet;
 *   Venom's own identity (both faces) and Side Holster (20021) both print it.
 * - `atEndOfActivation` — the engine `EffectSpec` already existed (a Boost ability's own "after this activation
 *   ends"), with no DSL wrapper; Making an Entrance's "After that thwart ends, if your hero removed all threat
 *   from a scheme that way, heal 2 damage" needs it from a player-side interrupt, not a Boost body.
 *   `currentActivationFrameId` (`packages/engine/src/stack.ts`) already matches a `thwart` event frame alongside
 *   `attack`/`enemyAttack`/`enemyScheme`, so this composes with no engine change.
 *
 * **Making an Entrance (20013)** reads "removed all threat from a scheme that way" as the scheme's threat sitting
 * at 0 once the (boosted) thwart resolves — `valueEquals(threatOn(eventTarget), 0)` inside the deferred
 * `atEndOfActivation` block, where `eventTarget` is the thwart event's own scheme (RRG 1.8 "Thwart", p. 44;
 * `trigger-events.ts`'s `eventSubjects` names the scheme as a `thwart` event's target). The interrupt itself
 * triggers on `basicPowerUsing` (the `on.basicPowerUsing`/`modifyBasicPower` pairing Rapid Growth, `wsp` 13005,
 * and Venom's own Pistol already use), not `on.thwarts`, since `modifyBasicPower` only reads that event.
 *
 * **Multi-Gun (20008)** parses into one `-action` ref plus three bullet-line refs (`-constant`/`-constant-2`/`-
 * constant-3`), the same ingestion artifact Hex Bolt (`scw` 15004) and several `trors` cards carry (docs/phase7-
 * wave2-scripting.md's own precedent): the `-action` ref's `chooseOne` already carries the whole printed text, so
 * the three extras are `partOf` it, each covered by its own branch test in `venom-kit.test.ts`.
