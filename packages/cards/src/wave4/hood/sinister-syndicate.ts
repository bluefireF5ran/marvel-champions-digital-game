/**
 * The Sinister Syndicate modular set (`hood` 24042-24048, docs/phase7-wave4.md §2.3): a side scheme (Crime Pays),
 * five minions (Beetle, Boomerang, Shocker, Speed Demon, White Rabbit) and a treachery (Sinister Onslaught).
 *
 * Crime Pays reads "if no minion was put into play this way" from `putIntoPlay`'s own report (`bind`,
 * docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.59), so a search that finds nothing, or a minion the unique rule turns away, surges.
 *
 * **Speed Demon (24046, `speed-demon-forced-interrupt`) is docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.21's own worked example** —
 * `forcedInterrupt({ on: "attack", selfIs: "target" }, enemyAttack(self, { targetCharacter: eventSource }))`.
 *
 * White Rabbit's boost, "choose and discard 1 identity-specific card from your hand", is `discardFromHand` filtered by
 * `identitySetOf: you` (wave 2's "a card of this player's identity set", reusable as is).
