/**
 * The State of Emergency modular set (`hood` 24055-24059, docs/phase7-wave4.md §2.3): four side schemes (Feisty
 * Heist, Disaster at the Docks, Offshore Inferno, Hot Pursuit) and a treachery (Citywide Crisis).
 *
 * Feisty Heist's "the highest-cost card from your hand" is a superlative over the hand bound as a slot (`selectCards`,
 * then `superlative` over the slot, the out-of-play pool `TargetRef.superlative` documents) and a real discard among the
 * tied cards (`discardFromHand` with `inSlot`): the player whose hand it is picks among ties, as a hidden hand is theirs
 * to show (docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.55). Citywide Crisis re-resolves each side scheme's When Revealed abilities, its
 * incite and surge included, in the order the first player chooses; a resolved incite or surge counts against the fallback
 * (`resolveWhenRevealedOf`, §3.56; FFG ruling, September 22, 2026; §4 Q23 as the owner revised it on 2026-10-20,
 * superseding the 2026-09-25 decision).
