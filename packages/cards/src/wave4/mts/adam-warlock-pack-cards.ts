 * "Discard up to N cards from the top of your deck → …" (Karmic Blast, Cosmic Awareness, Magic Attack, Zone of
 * Silence): the docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.12 composition — a `chooseOne` of 1..max, each `selectCards(topOfDeck(n))`
 * then `moveCards` to the discard pile. **The dependent effect (reading `chosen("discarded")`) has to be inside the
 * same `chooseOne` option, not a sibling after it**: `executeChooseOne` (`packages/engine/src/resolve/apply-effect.
 * ts`/`effects-frame.ts`) pushes a chosen option's own effects as a *child* frame, and a `selectCards` binding
 * written there (`updateFrame` on that child's own `frame.frameId`) never propagates back up to the parent frame a
 * sibling effect after the `chooseOne` would read — found by testing, not assumed (Magic Attack dealt 0 damage until
 * this was fixed). `effectFor(n)` gets the option's own literal count `n` to build the dependent effect with.
