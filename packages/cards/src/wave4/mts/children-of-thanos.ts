 * Children of Thanos (`mts` modular, 21125–21128, docs/phase7-wave4.md §2.2, §3.23): Thanos's own recommended
 * modular set (Black Order, `mts` 21100–21110, is scripted by Tower Defense — docs/phase7-wave4.md's own note on
 * `ebony-maw.ts`). Corvus Glaive and Ebony Maw (21125, 21127; Elite, Retaliate 1, Toughness, Villainous are data)
 * each print only a Boost line; Proxima Midnight (21126) also prints a standing "attacks gain piercing" line above
 * her Boost (the `[star]` marking both is the card's own bullet-icon convention, not a boost-only condition — the
 * same convention Black Panther's "Special" abilities use, `bp` 20003/20501/etc., not tied to being dealt as a
 * boost card); Tribute (21128, side scheme, Crisis icon is data) is a plain When Defeated.
