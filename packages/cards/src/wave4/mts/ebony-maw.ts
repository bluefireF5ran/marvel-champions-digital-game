/**
 * Ebony Maw (`mts` scenario, docs/phase7-wave4.md §2.2, §3.15, §3.16): the villain Ebony Maw I–III (21071–21073),
 * the main scheme Attack on Knowhere → The Power Stone (21074/21075), his own encounter set's Spell environments
 * (Fireball/Manipulation/Pacification/Rubblestorm, 21076–21079), treacheries and attachments (21080–21083),
 * Reactor Overload (21084), and the two recommended modular sets, Black Order (21085–21088) and Armies of Titan
 * (21089–21091).
 *
 * **The general rule "when a player reveals a Spell environment, they place that card in front of them in their
 * play area" (MC21 p. 6) is a rulebook instruction, not printed on any single card.** It is seeded at setup as a
 * scenario rule (`EBONY_MAW_SCENARIO_RULES`, `GameSetupConfig.scenarioRuleSpecs`, docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.40), so
 * every Spell revealed or put into play by an effect ("puts that card into play in their play area") goes to that
 * player's area through the engine's `entersRevealersPlayArea`.
 *
 * The rest of the set does not depend on that routing: the Forced Interrupt only reads whichever Spell
 * cards *are already* in a play area (`inPlayAreaOf`), and each Spell's own "enters play with N counters" / "last
 * counter removed" pair fires regardless of which area the card sits in.
