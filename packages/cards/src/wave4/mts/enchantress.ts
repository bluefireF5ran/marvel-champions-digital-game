 * Enchantress (`mts` modular, 21177–21179, docs/phase7-wave4.md §2.2, §3.9, §3.23): Thanos's own Valkyrie-nemesis
 * counterpart with the same three card names (Enchantress, Beguiled, Seduced) and near-identical printed text as
 * her Valkyrie obligation/nemesis set (`valk` 25029/25031/25032, `valk/valkyrie-obligation-nemesis.ts`) — but
 * `../reprints.ts` only aliases a wave 4 card against an *earlier* (Core–cycle 2) card, so a same-wave coincidence
 * like this is never auto-aliased, and the two sets are not the same encounter set at setup (this one is a
 * standalone recommended modular, not shuffled into a nemesis-only deck), so each gets its own script here. The one
 * behavioral difference: Beguiled/Enchantress's "the set-aside area" is `encounterSetAside` (the scenario's own
 * shared set-aside pool a set-aside Seduced would sit in — the same pool Odin's or Kang's set-aside cards use), not
 * a hero's own nemesis-set-aside pile (`valk`'s `setAside(you, …)`, only meaningful when Enchantress is played as
 * Valkyrie's nemesis set).
