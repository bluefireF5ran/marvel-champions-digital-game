/**
 * The Infinity Gauntlet modular set (docs/phase7-wave4.md §1.10, §3.6): the Infinity Gauntlet attachment (21129)
 * and the six Infinity Stone environments (21130–21135), used by the Thanos and Loki scenarios. Single-villain only
 * (`EncounterSet.singleVillainOnly`, data), so only the Thanos scenario (`thanos.ts`) is wired against it today;
 * Loki is left to whoever scripts that scenario's own primitives.
 *
 * **"Attach to the villain" (errata) needs no ability ref.** `attachesTo: { kind: "villain" }` plus the `setup`
 * keyword already puts the Gauntlet into play attached to the (single) villain at setup, generically
 * (`enterPlayOnReveal`'s `case "attachment"`, `packages/engine/src/resolve/reveal.ts`) — the same mechanism
 * `packages/cards/src/wave3/gmw/ronan.ts`'s own docblock describes for the Power Stone's `setup` keyword.
 *
 * **"After attached villain activates against you, resolve the Special ability of each infinity stone in play.
 * Otherwise, put the top card of the infinity stone deck into play."** "Activates against you" is the villain's own
 * attack *or* scheme, targeted at "you": `after.enemySchemesOrAttacks("host")` (the Gauntlet's host is the villain)
 * plus the same `playerIs: "controller", usesAttackedPlayer: true` pair `dsl/abilities.ts`'s private `againstYou`
 * constant builds for `on.enemyAttacks`'s own `againstYou` option — no ready-made helper combines "either enemy
 * event" with "against you", so this spreads the same fields directly onto the pattern object. `resolveSpecials({
 * cards: { trait } })` inherits this Forced Response's own controller (the attacked player) as "you" for each
 * Special that reads it (Mind Stone, Power Stone: "you are confused"/"you are stunned") — proven generically by
 * `packages/engine/src/resolve-specials-controller.test.ts`.
 *
 * Each Special's own "Place this card in the infinity stone deck discard pile" needs no destination beyond a plain
 * `discard`: the card's `home` (set when the Infinity Stone deck is built at setup, `EncounterSet.separateDecks`)
 * already routes it to the deck's own discard pile (`discardZoneFor`, `packages/engine/src/query.ts`) —
 * `thanos.ts`'s own docblock gives the same reading.
