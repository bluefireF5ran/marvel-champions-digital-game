/**
 * Legions of Hel (`mts` 21152–21155), one of Hela's own two recommended modular sets (MC21 p. 20). Draugr (a
 * minion), Fallen Warrior (an attachment, §3.9's own "ally treated as a minion" primitive), No Place for the Living
 * (a treachery) and its own signature side scheme, Legions of Hel.
 *
 * **Fallen Warrior (21153) is scripted exactly on Beguiled's own model** (`wave4/valk/valkyrie-obligation-nemesis.ts`
 * 25031, docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.9, landed): `treatAttachedAllyAsMinion([UNDEAD])` already gives the printed "SCH
 * equal to printed THW" (`schFromThw`) and "does not take consequential damage" (§3.29's own note: a treated-as-
 * minion ally can no longer be chosen as a basic attacker/thwarter, the only way consequential damage is assessed).
 * Unlike Beguiled, Fallen Warrior's own When Revealed does not attach to an *existing* ally — it finds one by
 * milling the revealing player's own deck (`discardDeckUntil`, the player-deck sibling of `discardEncounterUntil`)
 * until an ally turns up, puts *that* one into play, then attaches itself. No "if none found" clause is printed
 * (unlike Beguiled's own superlative-host case), so an empty `chosen("ally")` (the player's deck and discard both
 * ran out) makes every effect after it a no-op — the same reading `nebu/nebula-kit.ts`'s own `discardDeckUntil` use
 * already takes for an unguarded chain.
