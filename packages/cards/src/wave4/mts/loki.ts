/**
 * The Loki scenario (docs/phase7-wave4.md §2.2, §3.7, §3.23, the box's fifth scenario): five random stage-I Loki
 * villain cards (21160–21164), All Hail King Loki → its own victory-display win condition (21165), the Loki
 * encounter set's side schemes (Casket of Ancient Winters, War in Asgard, Madness on Midgard, Open the Bifrost,
 * 21166–21169), Loki's own three attachments (Loki's Staff/Crown/Cape, 21170–21172; Master of Illusions, 21173) and
 * three treacheries (Devious Sorcery, Infinite Mischief, The Trickster, 21174–21176). Enchantress (`enchantress.ts`)
 * and Frost Giants (the Hela pass) are its two recommended modular sets.
 *
 * **The random start, the swap, and the victory count are all engine primitives already** (docs/phase7-wave4.md
 * §3.7, landed 2026-09-24): `GameSetupConfig.randomStartingVillain`/`victoryCondition` (wired for this scenario in
 * `../setup.ts`'s `buildMtsSingleVillain`), `EffectSpec swapVillain`/`advanceToSetAsideVillain`, `ValueSpec
 * victoryCondition`, and a defeated last-stage-with-Victory-X villain going to the victory display automatically
 * (`defeatVillainStage`). All Hail King Loki 1B's own two lines (the Forced Interrupt and the win condition) are
 * exactly the DSL shape `packages/cards/src/dsl/wave4-primitives.test.ts`'s own "§3.7 Loki" test already proves.
 *
 * **21165a's own Setup** ("Set each copy of the Loki villain aside… Reveal 1 set-aside Loki villain at random")
 * needs no ability body for those two sentences (the scenario config does them before any card ability runs); the
 * remaining two — "Put the War in Asgard side scheme into play" and "Reveal the top card of the infinity stone
 * deck" — are `searchAndReveal` (revealing a side scheme puts it into play, `enterPlayOnReveal`'s `case
 * "side_scheme"`, the same reading `infinity-gauntlet.ts`'s own docblock gives for an attachment's `setup` keyword)
 * and a plain `scenarioDeck` top-card reveal (revealing an environment also enters it into play, the same case's
 * `"environment"` branch) — no player is named, so `firstPlayer` (the same choice `thanos.ts`'s own
 * `putTopStoneIntoPlay(firstPlayer)` and `infinity-gauntlet.ts`'s own "otherwise" branch make for an unnamed
 * scenario-level reveal).
 *
 * **The five Loki villain cards' own "When Defeated"** ("discard cards from the top of the encounter deck until a
 * side scheme is discarded, reveal that side scheme") is the Core Standard set's own Rampage idiom
 * (`core/modular/standard.ts` 01192): `discardEncounterUntil` + `revealCard`.
 *
 * **The four side schemes' own "When Defeated"** ("Reveal the top card of the infinity stone deck. Swap Loki with a
 * random set-aside Loki villain.") is the top-of-stone-deck reveal (`firstPlayer`, as above) then a plain
 * `swapVillain()` — there is only ever one villain in play in this scenario, so the default `{ kind: "villain" }`
 * target needs no further scoping.
 *
 * **Loki's Staff's own Boost ("Attack this card to Loki")** is read as "Attach this card to Loki" — MarvelCDB's
 * `text`/`real_text` both print "Attack", but the sibling Loki's Crown prints the same boost line correctly
 * ("Attach this card to Loki"), the sentence is otherwise meaningless game language ("attack" a card onto a
 * villain isn't a defined action), and the two are otherwise identical Uru-item-style attachments (`attachesTo:
 * { kind: "namedVillain", name: "Loki" }`), so this is a MarvelCDB transcription slip, not a rules question.
 *
 * **"Hero Response: After you make a basic attack against Loki, spend … → discard this card"** (Loki's Staff/Crown/
 * Cape) is a plain `response`, not `heroResponse`, for the same reason `thanos.ts`'s own docblock gives for Thanos's
 * Armor/Helmet: `heroResponse`'s `form: "hero"` gate reads `controllerOf` first, which is always `null` for an
 * attachment on the villain — an uncontrolled card. A basic attack can only be made by a hero, so `query("hero")`
 * as the attacker is exactly as restrictive.
 *
 * **The Trickster's own "Loki activates against you"** attacks you in hero form and schemes against you in alter-ego
 * form (`enemyActivates`, docs/phase7-wave5.md §4.1 Q67; RRG 1.8 "Activation", p. 6). It used to always scheme.
 *
 * **Infinite Mischief's own When Revealed** shuffles the Infinity Stone discard pile back into its deck on demand
 * (`scenarioDeckShuffle`, docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.49), distinct from the automatic empty-deck reset
 * (`ScenarioDeckState.whenEmpty`), then reveals the top card.
