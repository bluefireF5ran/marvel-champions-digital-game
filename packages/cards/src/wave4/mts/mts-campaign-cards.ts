/**
 * The Mad Titan's Shadow Campaign encounter set (`mts_campaign`, 21180-21193; MC21 pp. 7, 13, 17, 21, 25, 28):
 * campaign-only side schemes that flip into rewards (Secure the Landing Pad → Cosmo, Save the Shawarma Place →
 * Black Swan, Hack Sanctuary's Computer → Defensive Protocols), Security Breach, the System Shock obligation, the
 * Find the Norn Stones / Retrieve Odin's Armor pair, Norn Stone, Summoned Back, Open the Dungeons → Jormungand, and
 * the four Captive allies (Lady Sif, Fandral, Hogun, Volstagg). The campaign's own SETUP/VICTORY instructions that
 * put these cards into play, shuffle them in, or add them to the campaign pool are `../../campaigns/mts.ts`
 * (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §3); this module scripts each card's *own* printed text only.
 *
 * These cards only ever enter a game through `../../campaigns/mts.ts`'s campaign instructions or `System Shock`'s
 * own "shuffle it into your deck"/hand-grant text — MC21 p. 4: "Cards 180-193 ... cannot be included in any deck
 * unless playing The Mad Titan's Shadow campaign and the players were directed to add them ... by the Campaign
 * Instructions." `@mc/content`'s own `specificTo: { kind: "campaign", ... }` on the player-facing ones (Cosmo,
 * Shawarma, Norn Stone, Lady Sif, Fandral, Hogun, Volstagg) already keeps them out of ordinary deckbuilding
 * (`validateDeck`); nothing here re-enforces that.
 *
 * **The a/b flip pairs enter play on the new face** (docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.10, §4 Q17, user decision 2026-09-24):
 * `flipToOtherFace` (`packages/engine/src/resolve/other-face.ts`) already relocates the new face to where its type
 * lives and fires its "enters play" triggers (starting threat + hinder for a side scheme, engagement for a
 * minion), and already sends the new face's controller to `context.controllerId ?? firstPlayerId` — a side
 * scheme's own `whenDefeated` ability has no controller, so this is *already* "the first player" by construction
 * for every flip below (the same "covered by construction" shape `hela.ts` uses for Garm/Skurge/Nidhogg's own
 * "engages the first player").
 *
 * - **Secure the Landing Pad (21180a) → Cosmo (21180b)**: "The first player gains control of Cosmo" is
 *   `coveredByEngineRule()` (`21180b.cosmo-constant`) — a side scheme's own `whenDefeated` has no `context.
 *   controllerId`, so `apply-effect.ts`'s `flipCard` case already resolves the new face's controller to
 *   `ctx.state.firstPlayerId` by construction (`other-face.ts`'s own doc comment names this exact sentence);
 *   "Cosmo does not count against the ally limit" is a genuine standing rule (`21180b.cosmo-constant-2`); "Forced
 *   Interrupt: When Cosmo leaves play, remove him from the game" is `coveredByEngineRule()` — Cosmo is
 *   double-sided, and RRG 1.8 "Double-Sided Card" (p. 17) already sends a double-sided card leaving play out of the
 *   game (the same reasoning `hela.ts`'s Odin uses).
 * - **Security Breach (21181)**: a facedown-tuck-then-return pair, `tuckCards`/`tuckedUnder`.
 * - **Save the Shawarma Place (21182a) → Black Swan (21182b)**: "Black Swan engages the first player" is
 *   `coveredByEngineRule()` (`21182b.black-swan-constant`) — the same `flipCard`/`firstPlayerId` default as Cosmo
 *   above, and `other-face.ts`'s own `engagedEvent` push for the newly-flipped minion face; "Forced Response: After
 *   Black Swan engages you, discard 1 card from your hand" is genuinely triggered
 *   (`21182b.black-swan-forced-response`).
 * - **Hack Sanctuary's Computer (21184a) → Defensive Protocols (21184b)**: a plain "search deck+discard for 1
 *   card" reward, then a crash-counter countdown to System Shock, scripted with a pack-local `counterAtLeast`
 *   predicate (the same `gob/local.ts` shape — no `dsl` wrapper exists for it yet).
 * - **System Shock (21185)**: an obligation that lives in its owner's *hand* rather than their play area (unlike
 *   every other obligation, RRG 1.8 "Obligation", p. 30's "if a player draws an obligation card from their player
 *   deck, they place that obligation into their play area" — overridden by this card's own printed text, which
 *   only makes sense read as staying in hand), printing two independent clauses — a standing "you cannot choose to
 *   discard" restriction, and an unrelated hand-only Alter-Ego Action — now split into two refs by `parse-text.ts`
 *   (`QUOTED_HEADER_RE`, `card-data-pipeline`'s fix for a trigger header nested inside a quoted "gains: '...'"
 *   clause rather than printed bare, the one shape the existing Martial Law/Anti-Hero Propaganda generalization
 *   didn't cover). Both are `inHand(...)` (`AbilityDefinition.activeIn: "hand"`, docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.13, this
 *   exact card's own worked example in that field's doc comment): the constant rule is `cannotChooseToDiscard`,
 *   and the action removes the card from the game.
 * - **Find the Norn Stones (21186a) → Retrieve Odin's Armor (21186b)**: both a same-type (side scheme → side
 *   scheme) flip, so no relocation; each has a `threatCannotBeRemoved` gate and its own `whenDefeated` reward.
 * - **Norn Stone (21187a/b)**: an ordinary double-sided player upgrade — Setup/Permanent front granting stats and
 *   a Hero Action to ready-and-flip, an Alter-Ego Action on the back to heal.
 * - **Summoned Back (21188)**: "search ... for your nemesis minion" is `TargetQuery.nemesisMinionOf`
 *   (`toafk/kang.ts`'s own 11013b precedent), searched across deck, discard, *and* the player's own set-aside area
 *   (`anyOfCards`).
 * - **Open the Dungeons (21189a) → Jormungand (21189b)**: a same-type flip (side scheme → attachment is a *type*
 *   change, so it *does* relocate — to its printed host, Loki) whose own When Defeated lets each player choose a
 *   Captive ally from the campaign set; Jormungand's own Forced Interrupt pre-empts the normal "attachment
 *   discarded on host defeat" sweep by removing itself from the game first.
 * - **Lady Sif / Fandral / Hogun (21190-21192)**: the three Captive allies' own printed abilities. Volstagg
 *   (21193) has no ability ref (Retaliate/Toughness are both data-driven keywords).
