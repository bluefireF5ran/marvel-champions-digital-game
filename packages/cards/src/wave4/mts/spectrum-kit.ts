 * Spectrum / Monica Rambeau (21001a/b) and her energy-form kit (21002–21010, printed `aspect: "hero:21001a"`):
 * docs/phase7-wave4.md §1.1/§1.3 (the `form` keyword, the dash cost on Gamma/Photon/Pulsar) and §3.1 (additional
 * forms — landed 2026-09-24). Most of the kit is the exact composition `dsl/wave4-primitives.test.ts` §3.1 already
 * gives for these cards.
 *
 * **Energy Duplication (21006)** generates `printedResourcesOf` the faceup energy form (docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.38).
 *
 * **Pulsar Shield's (21009) retaliate grant** is `gainKeywordUntil` (docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.39).
