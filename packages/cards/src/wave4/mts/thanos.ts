/**
 * The Thanos scenario (docs/phase7-wave4.md §2.2, §3.6, §3.11): the villain Thanos I–III (21111–21113), the main
 * scheme The Infinity Stones → Balance the Scales (21114/21115), and his own encounter set (Sanctuary, Thanos's
 * Armor/Helmet, Master of the Stones, Avatar of Death, Deviant Syndrome, "I Am Inevitable", The Mad Titan, The
 * Titan's Throne — 21116–21124). The Infinity Gauntlet modular set (21129–21135) is `infinity-gauntlet.ts`.
 *
 * **The Infinity Stone deck** (MC21 p. 16, §1.10/§3.6) is built at setup from `infinity_gauntlet`'s
 * `EncounterSet.separateDecks` (wired in `../setup.ts`'s `buildMtsSingleVillain`), so "put the top card of the
 * infinity stone deck into play" is `selectCards` of `scenarioDeck("Infinity Stone", { top: 1 })` then
 * `putIntoPlay`, and "place this card in the infinity stone deck discard pile" is a plain move to `"discard"` — the
 * card's own `home` (set at deck-build time) already routes it to the Infinity Stone deck's own discard pile
 * (`discardZoneFor`, `packages/engine/src/query.ts`), matching `packages/engine/src/set-deck-and-run-out.test.ts`'s
 * own worked example.
 *
 * **"Thanos cannot take damage from player cards" (Sanctuary, errata RRG 1.8 p. 67)** is `RuleSpec
 * cannotTakeDamage { fromSource }`. RRG 1.8 "Player Card" (p. 33) lists seven printed types: ally, event, identity,
 * player side scheme, resource, support, upgrade. `PLAYER_CARD` below reads the five a card in this scenario's
 * pool could plausibly deal damage as (identity, ally, event, upgrade, support) — resource and player side scheme
 * cards deal no damage in this game's pool, so they're omitted rather than guessed at.
 *
 * **"Each player may spend up to 3 [physical] resources from their hand. Deal 2 damage to Thanos for each …
 * resource spent this way." (Sanctuary's own When Defeated)**: `spendResources` reports only whether its exact
 * requirement was met (`<bind>.made`, 0 or 1), not how many resources a variable payment used, so "up to 3,
 * scaling the result" can't be read back from one call. Scripted the same way `adam-warlock-pack-cards.ts`'s own
 * `discardUpTo` composes "discard up to N cards → …" (docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.12): each player's `chooseOne` of "spend
 * 0/1/2/3" commits to (and reads back only whether it succeeded at) exactly that count, and records it as `spent`.
 * The loop's `bind` sums those into `sanctuary.spent`, and the damage is one instance after the loop, 2 ×
 * `sanctuary.spent`: Thanos's Armor reduces it once, and no defeat is checked between two players' spends.
 *
 * **"Hero Response: After a hero makes a basic attack against Thanos, spend … → discard this card" (Thanos's Armor,
 * Thanos's Helmet)** is a plain `response`, not `heroResponse`: `heroResponse`'s `form: "hero"` gate is checked
 * against `controllerOf` *before* falling back to the acting player (`packages/engine/src/resolve/triggers.ts`
 * `candidatesFor`: `formSatisfied` returns `false` outright when `controllerOf` is `null`, which it always is for an
 * attachment on the villain — an uncontrolled card). A basic attack can only be made by a hero in the first place,
 * so the plain response with `query("hero")` as the attacker is exactly as restrictive and resolves correctly (the
 * acting player becomes the attacking hero via `uncontrolledYouOf ?? actingPlayerOf`).
 *
 * **"Forced Interrupt: When Thanos would take any amount of damage, reduce that amount by 1" (Thanos's Armor)** is
 * the same `reduceDamageTaken` constant `wave4/vision/vision-kit.ts`'s 26002.intangible-constant-2 uses for the
 * same printed wording without the "Forced Interrupt:" label — the engine's one damage-reduction rule regardless of
 * how the card announces it, and here with no `fromAttack` (the card says "any amount of damage", not "from each
 * attack").
 *
 * **"Thanos attacks you. That attack gains overkill and piercing." (Avatar of Death, 21120)** is `enemyAttack`
 * followed by `modifyAttack` in the same effects list — proven to apply to the very attack `enemyAttack` just
 * initiated by `packages/cards/src/wave1/twc/piledriver.ts` (`enemyAttack(...)` then `modifyAttack({ atkBonus: 2
 * })` right after it), not two separate abilities.
 *
 * **"Discard the top card of the infinity stone deck. Apply its boost icons … as if it were a boost card." (I Am
 * Inevitable, 21122's own Boost)** is `replaceBoostCount` (docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.6's own "not yet proven" item,
 * confirmed here): select the top card, move it to its own discard pile, then `replaceBoostCount(chosen)` — the
 * `packages/cards/src/wave2/scw/kit.ts` Chaos Control shape, over the Infinity Stone deck's own top card rather
 * than the encounter deck's.
