/**
 * Nebula (22001a/b) and her signature hero kit (22002–22010, printed `aspect: "hero:22001a"`): the shared
 * "Technique" mechanic (docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.23, `resolveSpecials`/`resolveSpecialsOf`, already landed and
 * reused as-is — no new primitive needed for this pack).
 *
 * **The identity's own loop**: Combat Protocols (hero face, 22001a) is a Forced Response, not a "Special" itself —
 * "After your turn begins, resolve the 'Special' ability on each technique upgrade you control, then discard each
 * technique upgrade resolved this way." The set of upgrades is bound once (`selectCards`) *before* any of their
 * Specials resolve, so a Special that somehow changed what's in play mid-resolution still only discards the
 * upgrades that actually existed and were offered at the start of this response — never a copy played afterward,
 * and never one already gone by the time this discard step runs (the shared `resolveSpecials({ of })` path already
 * drops ids that no longer exist, `packages/engine/src/resolve/effects-frame.ts`). Cybernetic Upgrades (alter-ego
 * face, 22001b) is a separate response that isn't gated to a form by any `heroResponse`/`alterEgoResponse` builder
 * — an identity's own two faces carry disjoint `abilities` arrays in `@mc/content` (`packages/content/src/data/
 * nebu/cards.ts`), so whichever face is currently up is the only one whose refs are ever "active"
 * (`activeAbilityRefs`); nothing here needs to say so again. Technique upgrades carry no printed form restriction
 * of their own, so a player can play one during alter-ego form specifically to trigger this draw before flipping
 * to hero.
 *
 * **Evasive Maneuvering's "ignores the guard keyword, the patrol keyword, and the crisis icon" (22005)** is the
 * standing `characterIgnores` exemption (docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.24), scoped to hero form.
