/**
 * "Cards in another hero's deck" (`docs/custom-deck-testing.md`, "Cards in another hero's deck"): every Vision pack
 * (`vision`, 26001a-26036) aspect/basic player card that has an ability script — every one whose own `aspect` is not
 * `hero:26001a` (an identity-specific card, RRG 1.8 "Identity-Specific Card", p. 23, only a Vision deck could hold) —
 * played through the engine from a Core hero's own precon instead of Vision's.
 *
 * Covered: protection 26013 Jocasta (response + constant), 26014 Protector, 26015 Victor Mancha, 26016 Flow Like
 * Water, 26018 Defiance, 26021 Preservation (hero form heals; alter-ego form does not) — all from Black Panther;
 * basic 26022 Machine Man (attack and thwart), 26024 Reboot (hero and alter-ego form), 26036 Meditation (Spider-Man,
 * alter-ego form; refused in hero form); aggression 26033 Assault Training (She-Hulk; Alter-Ego Action, refused in hero
 * form); justice 26034 Chance Encounter (Spider-Man, attached to a side scheme, refused on the main scheme);
 * leadership 26035 Joining Forces (Captain Marvel, with an Avenger and a Guardian ally in hand; Hero Action, refused
 * in alter-ego form). Jocasta, Victor Mancha and Joining Forces' extra allies are seated as extra deck copies
 * (`extraDeck`, deck legality relaxed) because the Core precons hold no Android or Guardian ally.
 *
 * Skipped: 26017 Indomitable, 26019 Side Step, 26020 Get Behind Me! and 26023 Avengers Mansion are verbatim reprints
 * aliased in `../reprints.ts` (their scripts are the earlier cards' own, tested with those); 26025-26027 (Energy,
 * Genius and Strength basic resources) print no ability; 26028-26032 are the obligation/minion/side scheme/treachery
 * encounter cards. The pack has no Team-Up card and no card with a trait gate that a Core hero fails.
 *
 * Also covered: 26013.jocasta-constant, playing Defiance (attached by her response) from Jocasta during an attack.
 *
 * Not covered: Protector's once-per-round limit.
 *
 * Every Core hero face has the Avenger trait; none has Android or Guardian.
