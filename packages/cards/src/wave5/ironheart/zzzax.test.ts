/**
 * The Zzzax modular set (`ironheart` 29033–29040, `zzzax.ts`). Games sit at Core's Rhino, Ironheart's own precon
 * with the Zzzax modular set added (`ironheartScenario`/`ironheartScenarioWithExtras`, `wave5Scenario` falls back
 * to `coreScenario(..., { cardPool: WAVE5_CARDS })` for a non-`sm` scenario id, `nova/armadillo.test.ts`'s own
 * "a non-Core modular set needs the pool passed both times" precedent already covered by that fallback). Photon
 * Beam (29006, `[energy]`, her own precon at 3 copies) and Falcon (29015, `[energy]`, 1 copy) are real deck cards,
 * used throughout to give hand/in-play cards a known printed `[energy]` icon count without extra surgery;
 * Propulsion Jets (29013, `[physical]`, 1 copy) is used where a *non*-energy hand card is needed (Haywire's own
 * override). Bombshell (29033) and Wasp (29034) are not in her real precon (Zzzax modular allies), so
 * `ironheartScenarioWithExtras` (deck legality off) carries them; Haywire (29038) and Air Static (29039) are
 * encounter cards (`encounterSetIds`, `attachesTo`/no printed cost) and enter play by being revealed. They're
 * shuffled into the encounter deck (not a set-aside nemesis card), so `revealFromEncounterDeck`/
 * `stageNemesisCardForReveal` is the wrong tool (throws "no `<code>` set aside") — this file's own `reveal` stacks
 * them on top instead, `nova/armadillo.test.ts`'s own `stageForReveal` precedent. Haywire's printed "Attach to your
 * identity" is data the engine's own implicit attach already handles at reveal (`armadillo.ts`'s own "Rollin',
 * Rollin'" docblock precedent: `attachesTo` present needs no scripted attach step, only the fallback a card's own
 * text adds — Haywire has none, and no `when-revealed` ability is registered for it).
 *
 * **Pinpoint (29035)** is exercised on each route a player card takes from play to a discard pile: an ally's defeat
 * (Vivian 29024, defeated by her own consequential damage after attacking), and an upgrade (Propulsion Jets 29013) or a
 * support (Tony Stark A.I. 29011) discarded by Core's Caught Off Guard (01188, Standard set: "Discard an upgrade or
 * support you control"), revealed in the villain phase — so Pinpoint is ready again there, whatever she did on the turn.
