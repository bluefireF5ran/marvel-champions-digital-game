/**
 * The Zzzax modular set (`ironheart` 29033–29040, docs/phase7-wave5.md): three Champion-trait player allies
 * (Bombshell 29033, Wasp 29034, Pinpoint 29035, aspect cards with no `encounterSetIds` — not encounter-deck cards,
 * confirmed against `packages/content/src/data/ironheart/cards.ts`), the side scheme Feedback Loop (29036), the
 * minion Zzzax (29037), the attachment Haywire (29038, quantity 2), the environment Air Static (29039) and the
 * treachery Zzzap! (29040, quantity 2). Every scan (`assets/card-art/bundles/cards/29033-29040.png`) matches the
 * ingested text exactly, including Zzzax's own Boost ("at least [energy] [energy] resources" = 2).
 *
 * **"Total number of [energy] resources"** (Feedback Loop, Zzzax, Zzzap!) counts printed icons, not cards — a card
 * with two energy icons contributes 2 — the same read `wave5/nova/obligation-nemesis.ts`'s "The War's Been
 * Brought" already established for `[wild]`: `selectCards` binds a zone's cards (there is no bare `TargetRef` for
 * "cards in a player's hand", unlike `each(query(...))` for cards in play), then `totalPrintedResources(chosen(
 * <slot>), ["energy"])` sums that pool's icons. "In their hand and on cards they control" (Feedback Loop, Air
 * Static) is the hand pool plus `each(query([], { controlledBy: <player> }))` (cards in play only, not hand —
 * `nova`'s own precedent distinguishes the two), summed together.
 *
 * **Bombshell (29033)** — "Divide damage from Bombshell's attack among each enemy as evenly as possible."
 * The `divideBasicPower` rule (Wasp's Giant form precedent, `wave2/wsp/kit.ts`) with `evenly: true`, so the split is
 * mandatory (`target: { self: true }`, not an identity). Ruling Jan 11, 2026 R4: the damage is divided as evenly as
 * possible among the valid targets (a Guard-protected villain is not one, so it is ignored). The engine refuses her
 * basic attack when two or more enemies are attackable and it is not divided among all of them with shares differing
 * by at most 1; the player still picks who takes a remainder. Not enforced when a card has her attack on its
 * instruction (`BasicPowerBy.instructed`), which keeps the optional split.
 *
 * **Wasp (29034)** — "Wasp ignores the guard keyword, patrol keyword, and crisis icon." `characterIgnores`
 * (`ignores`, wave 4 §3.24, Evasive Maneuvering/Nebula's own precedent) targeted at herself, not an identity, so no
 * `while` (hero-form) gate.
 *
 * **Pinpoint (29035)** — "Hero Interrupt: When a player card would be placed into a discard pile from play, exhaust
 * Pinpoint → shuffle that card into its owner's deck instead." A replacement (RRG 1.8 "Replacement Effect", p. 37) on
 * the generic `cardLeavesPlay` leaving (docs/phase7-wave5.md §4.1 Q17, Q32–Q34), not on `characterDefeated`: every
 * route from play to a discard pile — a defeat, a discard effect or cost, a move to the discard pile, an attachment
 * going with its host — waits for this interrupt window with the card still in play, and `instead(...)` cancels that
 * leaving and moves the card itself. `on.playerCardDiscardedFromPlay()` is "leaving for a player's discard pile",
 * which only player cards reach (RRG 1.8 "Discard", p. 16), so an encounter card going to the encounter discard pile
 * is never offered; an event card resolving is never in play (RRG 1.8 "In Play and Out of Play", p. 23), so it is not
 * either. `moveCards(…, "deckShuffle")` sends a card to its owner's deck and shuffles it, whoever controls Pinpoint.
 * An ally that is defeated this way is still defeated; only where it goes is replaced.
 *
 * **Zzzax (29037)** — the constant "gets +X ATK and +X hit points" reads `engagedPlayerOf(self)` live (no
 * `selectCards`/`chosen` needed outside an effect list: `totalPrintedResources` takes any `TargetRef`, including
 * `each(query(...))`, which is fine to read continuously). The Boost is `boost`'s own effect list, so it can use
 * `selectCards`/`chosen` as the When Revealed cards above do.
 *
 * **Haywire (29038) / Air Static (29039)** share one Hero Action shape: "Choose to either discard a card you
 * control with a printed [energy] resource or take 2 indirect damage → discard this card." RRG 1.8 "Ownership and
 * Control" (p. 31): "A player controls the cards in their own out-of-play areas (such as the hand… )" — so "a card
 * you control" spans hand *and* in-play cards, which needs two different existing cost primitives
 * (`discardFromHandCost`, hand only; `discardCardsCost`, in-play only). `eitherCost`'s own contract ("exactly one
 * branch is paid, the player's choice", `gmw/museum.ts`'s Grand Collection 1B precedent) already generalizes to any
 * number of branches, so a third branch alongside the two discard pools is the same primitive, not a special case —
 * together the three branches are exactly "discard a card you control (hand or in play) with a printed energy
 * resource, or take 2 indirect damage". Once Haywire is attached, its own `printedResourcesInHandAs` (wave 5 §3.20)
 * is "read by… every printed-resource query and count" (its own docblock), so `discardFromHandCost`'s `energy`
 * filter automatically accepts *any* hand card without extra plumbing — matching the printed interaction (a hand
 * card no longer needs a real energy icon to pay Haywire's own action once it is in play).
