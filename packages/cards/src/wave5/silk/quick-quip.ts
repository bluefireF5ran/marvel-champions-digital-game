/**
 * Quick Quip (`silk` 52034, cycle 9): `justice` aspect, generic. "Requirement ([mental]).\nHero Action: Deal 1 damage
 * to a Web-Warrior character you control → place a total of 2 confused status cards on up to 2 enemies."
 *
 * The Silk pack is not in any wave's pool yet; this one card is scripted here, in wave 5, because it is the same shape
 * as SP//dr's Thwip Thwip! (`spdr` 31017, `../spdr/events.ts`) with confused for stunned, and shares its primitives:
 * the `damageCards` cost (dealing damage as a cost: paid even if it is prevented, RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 14; ruling
 * 2026-06-25 R6 and 2026-07-09 R2) and a status `divide` over at most 2 enemies. A non-steady enemy takes one confused card, and
 * choosing just one of two enemies is allowed (ruling, Mar 6, 2026 (2), on this card). The Requirement keyword is
 * read from the card data by the engine. When the Silk pack is wired, this module moves under its own pack folder.
