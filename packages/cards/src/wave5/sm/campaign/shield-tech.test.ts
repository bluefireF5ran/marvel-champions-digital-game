/**
 * Real-game tests for the eight "Campaign - S.H.I.E.L.D. Tech" upgrades scripted in `./shield-tech.ts` (`sm`
 * 27182-27189). `deckLegality.test.ts` territory (`../../../campaigns/sm-campaign-cards-availability.test.ts`)
 * already proves the campaign-only restriction generically off real content for two of the eight; this file
 * proves each card's *own* printed text against a real game, the same division `wave4/mts/mts-campaign-
 * cards.test.ts` uses for its own campaign cards.
 *
 * None of the eight is payable through the normal "play a card" action (`specialCost: "dash"`, MC27 p. 22's own
 * "—" cost, RRG 1.8 "'—' Cost", p. 14): they enter play only through the campaign's own reputation-track reward
 * (`../../../campaigns/sm.ts`). `withUpgradeInPlay` below stands in for that grant the same way `mts-campaign-
 * cards.test.ts`'s own `upgradeInPlay` does — sourced from a real deck instance (`ghostSpiderScenarioWithExtras`,
 * `requireLegalDecks: false`) so the card data and default identity-attach (`packages/engine/src/actions.ts`'s
 * `attachTo = ... card.attachesTo ? null : ownIdentity`) are real, just seated directly in the play area instead
 * of through the blocked "play" action.
