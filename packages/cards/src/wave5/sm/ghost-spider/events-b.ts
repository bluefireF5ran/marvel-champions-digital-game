/**
 * Ghost-Spider's own signature events, part B (`sm` 27013–27019, MC27 p. 5, docs/phase7-wave5.md). Part A
 * (27002–27006) is a separate module/agent; the rest of the box's Ghost-Spider abilities are in
 * `support-upgrades-allies.ts`, `identity.ts` and `obligation-nemesis.ts`.
 *
 * **Bait and Switch (27013)**: "Hero Action (thwart): The villain attacks you. Remove 4 threat from the main
 * scheme." is printed identically at `15030` (`scw` Scarlet Witch pack, `wave2/scw/pack-cards.ts`), whose own
 * ability (`enemyAttack(theVillain, { against: you })` then a plain `thwart(4, theMainScheme)` under the ability's
 * own "(thwart)" label — "the main scheme", not "a scheme", so the real target is named directly rather than
 * offering a choice `thwartAScheme` would) is reused verbatim here.
 *
 * **Jump Flip (27014)**: "Hero Interrupt (defense): When you would take any amount of damage, prevent 2 of that
 * damage. If you paid for this card using a [energy] resource, remove 2 threat from the main scheme." — the same
 * `preventDamage` + `ifThen(paidWith(...), …)` shape §3.32 already cites for this exact card, with the second
 * sentence a plain `removeThreat` (unlabeled — only "prevent … damage" carries the ability's own "(defense)" label)
 * against `theMainScheme` (a printed, not chosen, target).
 *
 * **Return the Favor (27015)**: "Hero Action (attack): Discard cards from the top of the encounter deck until you
 * discard a treachery. Reveal that treachery → deal 5 damage to the villain." `discardEncounterUntil` +
 * `revealCard` (the Core Standard set's own Rampage idiom, `wave1/thor/kit.ts`'s "Defender of the Nine Realms"
 * precedent for the same "discard until X, then act" shape) then a real `attack(5, theVillain)` under the
 * "(attack)" label — not a bare `dealDamage`, so Retaliate/Guard/a Stunned attacker are read the normal way. Ruling
 * Apr 30, 2026 (2): paying this cost can Stun the hero (the revealed treachery's own "When Revealed" resolves as
 * part of `revealCard`, same as any other reveal) or let a Guard minion engage, in which case Step 6's real attack
 * effect fizzles the same way Core's basic attack/thwart actions already do — no extra scripting needed here, the
 * same reasoning `wave1/thor/kit.ts`'s own docblock gives for "Defender of the Nine Realms".
 *
 * **What Doesn't Kill Me (27016)**: "Requirement ([physical])" is schema-level data (Web Binding's own precedent,
 * `events-a.ts`) — no ability ref needed for it. "Hero Action: Heal 2 damage from your hero → ready your hero." is
 * a real cost → effect: `healYourIdentityCost(2)` (Captain Marvel's "Rechannel", `01010a`; Doctor Strange's
 * "Momentum Shift", `09016`) then `ready(yourIdentity)`.
 *
 * **Across the Spider-Verse (27018)**: "Max 1 per deck." is a `deckLimit`/`quantityInSet` fact already on the card
 * record. The exhaust is a COST (everything before the arrow, RRG 1.8 "Cost" p. 13): `exhaustCardsCost`, so with no
 * ready Web-Warrior card the event cannot be played. The repeat repeats the whole ability, cost included, so the
 * chosen player exhausts a card of theirs too (see `CHOOSE_A_PLAYER_WHO_MAY_REPEAT`). Printed: "Hero Action: Exhaust a Web-Warrior card you control → search your discard pile for a Web-Warrior ally
 * and put it into play, then choose a player. That player may spend 3 resources of any type to repeat this
 * ability." resolves the "exhaust a Web-Warrior card / search discard / put into play" sentence for `you` once
 * unconditionally, then a `repeatWhile` loop whose body is exactly the printed "choose a player, they may spend 3
 * to repeat" tail: `choosePlayer` (RRG 1.8 "Choose", p. 12: no printed chooser defaults to the ability's own
 * controller, so `you` — the original activator — keeps making this choice every time, never the newly chosen
 * player), then a `chooseOneBy(chosenPlayer(...), …)` offering that player the spend, and only *if they pay* does
 * this same sentence run again for them (RRG 1.8 "Across the Spider-Verse" FAQ, p. 62/63: "repeating the ability on
 * this card includes the repeat effect itself. As long as a player who can spend 3 resources and exhaust a
 * Web-Warrior card can be chosen, the ability can be repeated" — read here as the chosen player becoming the new
 * "you" for their own copy of the exhaust/search/put-into-play sentence, which is exactly what `repeatWhile`
 * re-running its own effects, parametrized on `chosenPlayer("player")`, gives for free; a player with no legal
 * Web-Warrior card to exhaust or no matching ally in their discard pile just has those steps resolve as no-ops,
 * the same forgiving "chooseCards `min: 0`, then act on whatever was chosen" idiom `identity.ts`'s own docblock
 * uses for Gwen Stacy's "shuffle Ticket to the Multiverse … if it's there"). `spendResources`'s own `<bind>.made`
 * var (`wave4/mts/thanos.ts`'s "Sanctuary" precedent) is both the loop's own decision flag and its `while`
 * condition, so a decline (no `spendResources` call at all in that branch) reads as `0`/`false` and ends the loop.
 *
 * **Young Love (27019)**: "Team-Up (Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales)" is the printed `teamUp` keyword (schema data).
 * "Max 1 per deck." is `deckLimit`. "Alter-Ego Action: Heal 3 damage each from Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales." is
 * `teamUpCharacters()`'s own docblock example verbatim (`dsl/values.ts` §3.34) — `heal(3, teamUpCharacters())`
 * heals both named characters (whoever controls them) in one effect, the same "every character a Team-Up card
 * names, as one ref" shape `wave3/gmw/groot-kit.ts`'s "Flora and Fauna" uses for `ready(teamUpCharacters(0))`.
