/**
 * Ghost-Spider (`sm` 27001a–27029) supports, upgrades and allies scripted directly (docs/phase7-wave5.md §3.13,
 * §3.14, §3.15, §3.32): George Stacy (27007), Ticket to the Multiverse (27008), Web-Bracelet (27009), Silk
 * (27010), Spider-Man / Miles Morales (27011), Spider-UK (27012), Spider-Man / Hobie Brown (27017), Web of Life
 * and Destiny (27023), Plan B (27024). 27020–27022 are basic resources with no abilities (data only). Her events
 * (27002–27006, 27013–27019) and obligation/nemesis set (27025–27029) are separate modules.
 *
 * **George Stacy (27007) — §3.15's own worked example**: a constant `playableAttachments(query("event"))` for
 * "Events attached to George Stacy may be played as if they were in your hand", and an Action that attaches a
 * chosen hand event facedown, gated `to a maximum of 3` by `valueAtMost(countOf({ host: self, facedown: true }),
 * 2)` before adding a fourth (ruling Mar 30, 2026 (1): the maximum is local to this card).
 *
 * **Ticket to the Multiverse (27008)**: "Remove … from the game" prints before the "→", but no `AbilityCost`
 * shape exists for removing the card itself from play as a cost (`discardThis`/`exhaustThis` cover exhaust/discard
 * only) — resolved as the first plain effect instead, the same "remove this card from the game" shape Grand
 * Strategy (`gmw` 16174) and Loss of Control (`mts` 21026) already use for a same-sentence removal with no
 * intervening decision point, so the ordering is unobservable. "Ready each Ghost-Spider card you control" reads as
 * literally titled "Ghost-Spider" (only the identity's own hero face, 27001a, prints that title in this box) —
 * `query(["identity"], { name: "Ghost-Spider", controller: "you" })`, not her signature card pool (there is no
 * `identitySetOf`-style keyword name on any card here, and the card is dated errata-free).
 *
 * **Web-Bracelet (27009)** reuses Ghost-Spider's own `onInterruptOrResponseResolvedOnEvent` (§3.32's
 * `abilityResolved`/`abilityTiming` citation for this exact card) with `maxOnePerTriggeringInstance` (§3.14): the
 * documented "known limit" (the instance is the `abilityResolved` event itself, not the played event card) is
 * accepted as built — no wave 5 card needs two Interrupt/Response abilities to resolve on the same played event.
 *
 * **Silk (27010)** searches the encounter deck (not the discard pile — only "the encounter deck" is printed) for
 * a treachery and discards it, gated on controlling *another* Web-Warrior card (`self: false`); `min: 1, max: 1`
 * follows the "search for a [category] and discard/reveal it" precedent (`trors` Zola set, `04111.when-revealed`)
 * over the "may find none" `min: 0` shape, since a treachery is assumed to exist in a Core-sized encounter deck.
 *
 * **Spider-Man / Miles Morales (27011)** stuns and confuses an enemy if 3+ Web-Warrior cards (himself included,
 * unlike Silk's "another") are controlled — one chosen enemy, not two separate choices, since "stun and confuse
 * an enemy" names one target for both statuses (RRG 1.8 "Status Cards", p. 42: idempotent, so applying both to
 * the same chosen enemy is the literal reading).
 *
 * **Spider-UK (27012)**: `on.defends` names Spider-UK himself (`self: true`, the `rocket-kit.ts` "Groot" precedent
 * for an ally defending), and the attacking enemy is `eventSource` (the "defended" event's own source, per
 * `mts/spectrum-kit.ts` Pulsar Shield / `vision-kit.ts` Mass Increase) — resolved immediately in the interrupt
 * window rather than deferred with `atEndOfAttack`, since dealing damage here isn't a stat modifier riding the
 * attack's own event frame.
 *
 * **Spider-Man / Hobie Brown (27017)** is §3.13's own worked example verbatim, with the printed damage-to-villain
 * sentence added: `countBoostIcons(chosen("discarded"), …)` sums boost icons across every card `discardEncounterCards`
 * bound (`qsv/kit.ts`'s "Ghost Kick" precedent for the same shape). "Play only if you control a Web-Warrior card"
 * is a `playOnlyIf` constant (data does not carry a schema-level `playRestrictions` entry for this card, unlike
 * Plan B's `anyPlayerControl`, so it needs its own ability ref — matching this card's own `abilities` array).
 *
 * **Web of Life and Destiny (27023)**: "Ignore this card's resource cost if your identity has the Web-Warrior
 * trait" is a `costModifier` whose `delta` negates the card's own printed cost (`scaled(printedCostOf(self), {
 * times: -1 })`, since the flat `-1`/`-N` shape `mts/adam-warlock-pack-cards.ts`'s Martinex uses only works when
 * the reduction happens to equal the printed cost) while in hand (`activeIn: "hand"`), gated on `youHaveTrait`
 * (the "Martinex" precedent for "if your identity has the [trait] trait"). The response is §3.13's own worked
 * example, with "choose a player → that player draws 1 card" added (`choosePlayer`/`chosenPlayer`, the
 * `mts/spectrum-pack-cards.ts` Avengers Mansion precedent).
 *
 * **Plan B (27024)**: "Play under any player's control. Max 1 per player." is schema-level `playRestrictions`
 * (`anyPlayerControl`/`maxPerPlayer`, already on the card record) — no ability ref needed for it. Only the Hero
 * Action itself is scripted.
