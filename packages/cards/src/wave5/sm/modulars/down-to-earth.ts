/**
 * Down to Earth (`sm` 27131/27133/27134/27135, docs/phase7-wave5.md §2.2): a modular set built around the
 * alter-ego's own civilian life rather than combat — Common Criminal is resolved with an Alter-Ego Action, Volunteer
 * Work cannot be thwarted at all (only paid down via its own Alter-Ego Action), and both treacheries pressure the
 * player's form choice. Friends and Family (27132, obligation) is a member of this modular
 * (`DOWN TO EARTH (2/7)`, encounter set `down_to_earth`): it belongs to no hero's kit, so it is shuffled into the
 * encounter deck with the set and given to the player who reveals it (RRG 1.8 "Obligation", p. 30), and it is
 * scripted here. (QA 2026-10-13 finding 6: an earlier emit left its `encounterSetIds` empty, which made it look
 * unreachable.)
 *
 * **Loose Ends (27135)**: "Search the encounter deck, discard pile, set-aside area, and removed-from-game area for a
 * copy of your obligation, then reveal it" is one pool (`anyOfCards`) over the encounter deck and discard pile, both
 * set-aside areas the engine keeps (the player's own and the scenario's; `setAside`/`encounterSetAside`) and the
 * removed-from-game area (`removedFromGameCards`), filtered by `TargetQuery.obligationOf` (RRG 1.8 "Obligation",
 * p. 30), capped to one copy (`atMost`). The searched encounter deck is shuffled before the reveal (RRG 1.8 "Search",
 * p. 39). The removed-from-game area is reachable because the card prints it: ruling December 17, 2025 (4)'s "cannot
 * be returned to the game by any means" is about generic retrieval, and card text naming the area overrides it.
 *
 * "During that reveal, if you change to alter-ego form, discard 1 random card from your hand" is approximated as
 * "in hero form before the reveal and in alter-ego form after it": a `setVar` snapshot of the form, compared once the
 * revealed obligation has finished resolving. The shared obligation shape (`core/obligations.ts`: "You may flip to
 * alter-ego form. Choose: …") flips once, first, and its options don't read your hand, so for those the outcome
 * matches the printed text. Not modeled: the discard happening at the moment of the change (mid-reveal) rather than
 * right after the reveal, and a hero → alter-ego → hero round trip inside one reveal (which would not discard here). The exact primitive — a
 * delayed trigger scoped to one reveal ("after you change to alter-ego form during this reveal") — does not exist.
