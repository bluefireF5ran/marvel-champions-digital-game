/**
 * Osborn Tech (`sm` 27147–27152, docs/phase7-wave5.md §2.2/§3.31): the Sinister Motives villain-attachment modular
 * set — Arm Cannon, Ionic Boots, Kinetic Armor, Neocarbon Scales, Spiked Gauntlet, Tracking Display. Every card's
 * printed `[star]` marker is a reminder icon with no gameplay meaning (confirmed by the curation notes for the same
 * marker on other packs, e.g. `packages/content/scripts/marvelcdb/curation/core.ts` "The [star] is a reminder
 * icon.") — the constant/Forced Response text on these cards is unconditional, not gated by anything the star could
 * mean. "Attach to the villain" (`attachesTo: { kind: "villain" }`) is data, resolved by the engine's own reveal
 * step, not scripted here.
 *
 * Every card's "Hero Action: … → discard this card" pays the part before the arrow as a real `AbilityCost`, so the
 * action is offered only while that cost can be paid in full and the cost is paid before (and apart from) the effect
 * (RRG 1.8 "Cost", pp. 13–14; "Cost Arrow Icon", p. 14): Arm Cannon's "discard the highest-cost upgrade you control"
 * is `discardCardsCost(…, { superlative: "highest" })`, Kinetic Armor's "take 3 indirect damage" is
 * `takeIndirectDamageCost(3)`, Neocarbon Scales' "give the villain a tough status card and 1 facedown boost card" is
 * `giveStatusCost` plus `giveBoostCardsCost`.
