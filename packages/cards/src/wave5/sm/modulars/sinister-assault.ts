/**
 * Sinister Assault (`sm` 27158–27163, docs/phase7-wave5.md §2.2/§4.1 Q67 survey's own "not scripted yet" list): six
 * Elite minions, one per Sinister Six member — Doctor Octopus, Electro, Hobgoblin, Kraven the Hunter, Scorpion,
 * Vulture. Each card's own stat line, traits and villain-phase keyword (Incite 2, Retaliate 1, Patrol, Steady,
 * Toughness, Quickstrike) plus "Villainous" are all data (`packages/content/src/data/sm/cards.ts`), not scripted
 * here; only the `[star]` Forced Response on each is an ability.
 *
 * Doctor Octopus, Electro and Vulture are worded "activates against you" — `on.enemyActivates`/`after.enemyActivates`
 * (RRG 1.8 "Activation", p. 6; docs/phase7-wave5.md §4.1 Q67): a card-caused attack or scheme against a player is
 * also an activation, so these fire from a card effect that makes the minion attack or scheme, not only from its own
 * villain-phase step 2 activation. Hobgoblin is worded "attacks you" (the Q67 survey's own "stays an attack" list),
 * so it keeps `on.enemyAttacks`. Kraven the Hunter and Scorpion are worded "attacks and damages a character[, …]",
 * naming no activation at all — also `on.enemyAttacks`, following Klaw's Sonic Converter (`core` 01118) and Laufey
 * (`mts` 21156) for the identical "attacks and damages a character, stun that character" shape.

  // until you discard a [energy] or [wild] resource. "Engages" is a separate event from an activation (RRG 1.8
  // "Engage", p. 18, vs. "Activation" p. 6), so the trigger is a raw multi-kind pattern over `minionEngaged` plus
  // the activation events — the same shape `wave3/gmw/badoon.ts` Badoon Engineer (16065) and Badoon Assassin
  // (16117) already use for "engages you or activates against you". None of these three events carries a
  // controller, so "your deck" resolves through the same "an encounter card's 'you' is the player the event is
  // about" rule (`resolve/triggers.ts` `actingPlayerOf`) the Badoon cards rely on too — no explicit `playerIs`
