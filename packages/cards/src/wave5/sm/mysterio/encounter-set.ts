  // 1` alone is a generic spend, "of any type" (`13027.mothers-orders-constant`'s own precedent); the engine has no
  // `AbilityCost` for "shuffle N cards into your deck" as part of a paid cost, so the shuffle is scripted as an
  // effect after the resource cost instead of inside it. Nothing in this ability branches on whether the shuffle is
  // "cost" or "effect", and it can never go unpaid (the deck reshuffles its own discard pile rather than run out,
