/**
 * The Sinister Six's four encounter attachments (`sm` 27103–27106, MC27 p. 15) and its own side scheme (27107). Each
 * attachment's "Attach to the villain with the [highest/lowest/most] [measure]. If you cannot, resolve the 'Ambush!'
 * ability on the main scheme, then attach this card to the active villain." is `AttachmentCard.attachesTo` (a
 * `superlative` host, docs/phase7-wave2.md §6.7's own reading of this exact card — attachment-host.ts's own
 * `activationOrder` doc cites Heightened Morale/Team Leader by name) plus the printed `statModifiers` box where the
 * bonus is a fixed number; none of that is scripted here.
 *
 * The "If you cannot, resolve the 'Ambush!' ability on the main scheme, then attach this card to the active villain."
 * half is each card's first ability ref (`AMBUSH_FALLBACK`), a `cannotAttach` ability: the engine resolves it instead
 * of RRG 1.8 "Attach To"'s (p. 8) discard when the `attachesTo` host finds no villain. The main scheme's own Setup
 * puts villains into play before any of these is drawn (§1.5), so "no villain in play" is transient: only between a
 * villain's defeat and the next villain activation (`main-scheme.ts`'s own `AMBUSH_INTERRUPT`).
