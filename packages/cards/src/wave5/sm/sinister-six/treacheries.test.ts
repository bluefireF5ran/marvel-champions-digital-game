/**
 * The Sinister Six's five treacheries (`sm` 27108–27112, MC27 pp. 15–16, docs/phase7-wave5.md §3.1/§3.11/§4.1
 * Q67; `treacheries.ts`). The six villains (Doctor Octopus 27094 order 1, Electro 27095 order 2, Hobgoblin 27096
 * order 3, Kraven the Hunter 27097 order 4, Scorpion 27098 order 5, Vulture 27099 order 6) are named by printed
 * title only, per `treacheries.ts`'s own convention — nothing here imports their (separately-scripted) cards.
 *
 * Forcing 2-3 of the six villains into play (below) always leaves one of them holding the *real* active counter, so
 * MC27 p. 15's own "only the villain with the active counter activates" still fires that villain's ordinary
 * per-phase attack/scheme *in addition to* whatever the revealed treachery scripts (RRG's normal step 2, unrelated
 * to step 4's reveal). Rather than fight that with test-only stunning (which turned out to suppress the villain's
 * per-activation boost draw too — RRG "Stun" discards the status "instead of activating", so `activateEnemy` never
 * reaches `giveBoostCard` for a cancelled activation, silently pushing the stacked target card into that boost slot
 * instead of the player's dealt card), these tests read which villain actually holds the counter and add its known,
 * boost-icon-free (the leading `FILLER` filler prints 0) printed ATK/SCH into the expected total instead.
