/**
 * The six Sinister Six villains (`sm` 27094-27099, MC27 p. 15, docs/phase7-wave5.md §1.5/§3.1) print identical
 * structure and differ only in their Forced Response's own effect:
 *
 *   "[star] Forced Response: After <Villain> attacks and damages you, <EFFECT>. Move the active counter to the next
 *   villain in the activation order.
 *   When Defeated: Remove 4 threat from a side scheme (7 threat instead if no other villain is in play). Set this
 *   villain aside."
 *
 * `sinisterSixVillain` builds both ability definitions once per villain; callers only supply `<EFFECT>` and register
 * the pair under that villain's own printed ability ids.
 *
 * Rulings:
 * - "Move the active counter to the next villain in the activation order" wrapping past the highest activation order
 *   value back to the lowest, and a lone villain simply keeping the counter, is `moveActiveCounterToNextVillain`'s own
 *   engine behavior (MC27 p. 15 "Activation Order"; its p. 21 FAQ), not scripted again here.
 * - "A side scheme" with more than one in play is a choice among several; nothing in the printed text says who
 *   chooses, so the first player does (RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 19 — the same reading as Crime Pays's "search…and
 *   put it into play" in `hood/sinister-syndicate.ts`). With zero side schemes in play there is no legal target, so
 *   the whole ability does nothing beyond moving the counter and setting the villain aside — not a forced failure to
 *   remove threat (RRG 1.8 "Choose (Game Element)", p. 12).
 * - "No other villain is in play" is read at the moment When Defeated resolves, excluding this villain itself
 *   (`query("villain", { excluding: self })`) so it reads correctly whether or not the defeated villain has already
 *   left the villain area by then.
 * - "Set this villain aside" (`setVillainAside(self)`) returns the card to the `encounterSetAside` pool that Sinister
 *   Synchronization/Beatdown's own "Ambush!" draws a random villain from (`main-scheme.ts`), as a new copy per RRG 1.8
 *   "Leaves Play" (p. 27).
