 * at the moment this one is revealed (RRG 1.8 "Uses", p. 46's own edge-triggered state check, `dsl/abilities.ts`

 *
 * The least-threat schemes are found first, then `from` is struck from them: an element cannot move to its current
 * placement (RRG 1.8 "Move", p. 30), so a tie with another scheme forces the move there, and `from` alone at the
