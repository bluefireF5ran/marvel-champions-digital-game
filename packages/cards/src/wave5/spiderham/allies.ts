/**
 * Spider-Ham's own non-signature allies (`spiderham` 30002, 30012, 30013, 30020, 30021; Spider-Ham Hero Pack p. 1,
 * 3-4): Captain Americat (30002), Lady Spider (30012), Spider-Man / Pavitr Prabhakar (30013), Scarlet Spider
 * (30020), SP//dr (30021). Read directly off `packages/content/src/data/spiderham/cards.ts` (no errata on RRG 1.8
 * pp. 67-68, confirmed against each card's own scan, `assets/card-art/bundles/cards/<id>.png`).
 *
 * **Captain Americat (30002)** — "Response: After Captain Americat enters play, give someone a high five. Place 1
 * toon counter on your identity and shuffle 1 Spider-Ham card from your discard pile into your deck." "Give someone
 * a high five" is a purely social/narrative instruction with no game-state effect — the same "unscripted flavor
 * direction" reasoning `events.ts`'s own docblock already gives for this exact clause (30004/30005). "1 Spider-Ham
 * card" reads as this player's own identity-specific set (`identitySetOf: you`, RRG 1.8 "Identity-Specific Card",
 * p. 23) rather than a literal name match: no other card in this box is printed with the bare name "Spider-Ham"
 * (only the identity's hero face carries that title; every ally here has its own name), the Quicksilver/Nova
 * "shuffle N [Hero] cards from your discard pile into your deck" precedent (`wave2/qsv/kit.ts` 14007, `wave5/nova/
 * support-upgrades-allies.ts` 28008) for exactly this shape, not the "several differently-typed cards share one
 * printed name" reading Miles Morales's own alter-ego response needs (`wave5/sm/spider-man-morales/identity.ts`
 * 27030b). `min: 0, max: 1` is forgiving when the discard pile holds no such card (the same War Machine/Miles
 * Morales "shuffle 1 named card" idiom), so a missing copy leaves the toon counter placed instead of failing the
 * whole Response.
 *
 * **Lady Spider (30012)** — "[star] Response: After Lady Spider thwarts and removes threat from a scheme, if you
 * control another Web-Warrior card, remove an equal amount of threat from a different scheme." The printed
 * "[star]" is the card's own unique-icon glyph (Agent 13's own precedent, `wave5/ironheart/allies.ts` module
 * docblock), not a keyword — scripted as a plain `response`. `on.thwarts("self")` is the trigger; `eventAmount`
 * reads the threat the thwart actually removed (RRG 1.8 "Thwart", p. 44): in a thwart's response window its event's
 * `amount` is its resolved removal, for a basic thwart as for a "(thwart)" ability (`packages/engine/src/resolve/
 * event.ts` `resolvedAmount`). Gated `valueAtLeast(eventAmount, 1)` so a thwart that removed no threat (blocked,
 * as by Brute Force Barricade) never opens the "different scheme" choice, matching "thwarts **and removes
 * threat**". Her own removal from the different scheme is a `removeThreat`, not a thwart, so it cannot retrigger
 * her. "If you control another Web-Warrior card" is `exists` on `A_WEB_WARRIOR_CARD` with `self: false` (Lady
 * Spider herself does not count as "another"). "A different scheme" excludes the just-thwarted scheme via
 * `TargetQuery.excluding: eventTarget` (`packages/engine/src/spec.ts`'s own worked example is exactly this shape),
 * not `excludeSlots` (that excludes a *chosen slot* from earlier in the same ability, the wrong tool for excluding an
 * externally-triggered event's own target).
 *
 * **Spider-Man / Pavitr Prabhakar (ally, 30013)** — "Response: After Spider-Man enters play, remove 1 threat from
 * a scheme for each Web-Warrior card you control (including Spider-Man)." By the time this Response resolves he is
 * already in play, so `countOf(A_WEB_WARRIOR_CARD)` (no `self: false`) counts him automatically — the same reading
 * the printed parenthetical spells out, needing no extra term. A different card from `sm`'s own hero identity
 * "Spider-Man" (Miles Morales, 27030a/b) and its allies of the same name (27011, 27017, 27049): this module's own
 * ability id namespace (`30013.…`) never collides with theirs.
 *
 * **Scarlet Spider (30020)** — "Play only if you control a Web-Warrior card.\nInterrupt: When you would reveal an
 * encounter card, name a card type, then look at that card. If that card is of the named type, deal 1 damage to
 * Scarlet Spider and draw 1 card." `playOnlyIf(exists(A_WEB_WARRIOR_CARD))` is the Ghost-Spider/Vivian precedent
 * (`wave5/sm/ghost-spider/support-upgrades-allies.ts` 27017, `wave5/ironheart/allies.ts` 29024's own module note)
 * verbatim. `{ ...on.encounterCardRevealed(), playerIn: you }` is Spider-Ham's own "I Don't Think So!" precedent
 * (`events.ts` 30005) for "when **you** reveal a card" — the interrupt window fires before the card resolves, the
 * literal "would reveal" moment (RRG 1.8 "Reveal"). "Name a card type, then look at that card" is Cosmo's own
 * blind-guess-then-look shape (`wave4/nebu/nebula-pack-cards.ts` 22020, copied from `stld` 17020): one `chooseOne`
 * option per encounter card type (the same five Cosmo's own "the encounter deck" branch offers — minion, side
 * scheme, attachment, treachery, obligation), the naming happening *before* any effect reveals the card's actual
 * type, so it is a genuine guess, not an informed choice. `lookAt(cards(eventTarget))` is the printed "look at that
 * card" itself (RRG 1.8 "Look, Looked-At", p. 27) — the card being revealed, not a fresh draw off the top of a
 * deck, so `eventTarget` (not `topOfDeck`/`encounterCards`) is both what's looked at and what `refMatches` compares
 * against the named option's own category, with `anywhere: true` since the card is not "in play" while its reveal
 * is still pending (`refMatches`'s own docblock, Gamora 18001b's precedent).
 *
 * **SP//dr (ally, 30021)** — "Play only if you control a Web-Warrior card.\nWhen Defeated: Add SP//dr to your hand
 * if she was defeated by taking excess consequential damage." The play restriction is the same `playOnlyIf`
 * constant as Scarlet Spider above. The When Defeated reads the defeat itself: `defeatedWithExcessConsequentialDamage`
 * is excess damage (RRG 1.8 "Excess Damage", p. 19: beyond her *remaining* hit points, so exactly lethal consequential
 * damage is not excess and she is discarded) from an ally's own consequential damage (RRG 1.8 "Consequential Damage",
 * p. 13, after an attack or a thwart alike), recorded on the `characterDefeated` event. Any other defeat (an enemy
 * attack, a treachery's damage), excess or not, leaves her to be discarded. A When Defeated resolves before the
 * defeated card leaves play (RRG 1.8 "When Defeated Abilities", p. 48), so `moveCards(cards(self), "hand")` takes her
 * from play to her owner's hand in place of the discard, as Zola's own "remove from the game" does (`wave2/trors`
 * 04122).
