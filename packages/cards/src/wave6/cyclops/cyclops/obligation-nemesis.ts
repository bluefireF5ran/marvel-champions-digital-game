 * Lost Visor (33027), Cyclops's obligation, and his Mister Sinister nemesis set: Mister Sinister (33028, nemesis
 * minion), Genetic Manipulation (33029, side scheme), Gene Therapy x2 (33030, attachment) and Concussive Force (33031,
 * treachery).
 *
 * - **Lost Visor** is not the shared `obligation()` shape: it stays in play with the visor tucked under it, a constant
 *   plus an alter-ego action (the two refs Valkyrie's Trouble in Otherworld has) and an unheaded When Revealed, the
 *   printed search, which the card data carries as `33027.lost-visor-when-revealed` (a curated
 *   `unheadedWhenRevealed` correction). It searches the hand, deck, discard pile and play area (the card prints hand
 *   too) for Ruby Quartz Visor and tucks it facedown under Lost Visor; the action returns whatever is tucked under the
 *   card to the hand.
 * - **Gene Therapy** is Unstoppable's shape (`../../mut_gen/colossus/obligation-nemesis.ts`): the host is `attachesTo`
 *   data (lowest printed ATK, no copy), "otherwise gains surge" and the forced interrupt are scripted.
 * - **Mister Sinister** / **Concussive Force**: his boost is Slammed's (stun, or 2 damage if already stunned).
