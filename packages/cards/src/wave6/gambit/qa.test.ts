/**
 * Wave 6 rules QA, Gambit pack (`docs/phase7-wave6-qa-gambit-rogue.md`). Two parts.
 *
 * 1. Errata, FAQ entries and rulings that touch a card of the pack (Gambit, his nemesis set, the Exodus modular set).
 *    Already pinned exactly by a module test, so not copied here:
 *    - Erratum RRG 1.8 p. 68, Psionic Shield (#34): "When attached minion would leave play, instead heal all damage from
 *      that minion. Then, discard this attachment.": `exodus/index.test.ts` "37034.psionic-shield-forced-interrupt" (two
 *      tests: the defeat heals him and discards the Shield, the next defeat removes him). New below: the "put it back
 *      into play" half of the erratum (nothing re-enters, so no second When Revealed, no second engagement, statuses stay).
 *    - Ruling Dec 17, 2025 (3), "after [enemy] attacks you" is the player (Bishop 37011): `gambit/support-upgrades-
 *      allies.test.ts` "Bishop: an attack on your ally still counts (the player is attacked)".
 *    - Ruling Dec 17, 2025 (3) on "when ... attacks" cards (Flash Freeze) names Storm's card; Gambit's Staff is the same
 *      "when an enemy attacks" shape with no "you": `support-upgrades-allies.test.ts` "Gambit's Staff: also answers a
 *      minion's attack".
 *    - Charged Card's thresholds (RRG-less, card text only) and Q27 (Throw de Card adds to each Royal Flush instance):
 *      `gambit/events.test.ts` "Charged Card (37006)" and "Royal Flush (37007)".
 *    No other erratum, FAQ entry or post-1.7 ruling names a card of this pack (the p. 69 "Exodus (#28)" erratum is the
 *    Magneto Hero Pack's own Exodus, not 37032).
 *    New below: the single-turn Throw de Card / Royal Flush / Charged Card chain (nothing leaks between plays), Natural
 *    Agility's +DEF against a tough status card (FAQ p. 56, RRG p. 44), Toughness against Charged Card's overkill (RRG
 *    pp. 31, 44), Team-Up (RRG p. 43) satisfied by the other hero, and Assassination Attempt's attacks one at a time
 *    (ruling Feb 28, 2026 (1) #2).
 * 2. Whole games with Gambit's precon: 2 players standard (with Cyclops) and 1 hero expert, played by the greedy driver
 *    and replayed deep-equal, asserting Charge de Card and Throw de Card resolved; one more game with the Exodus
 *    modular set.
