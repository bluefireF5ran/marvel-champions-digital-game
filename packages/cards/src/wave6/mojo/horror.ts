/**
 * MojoMania (`mojo`), the Horror genre set (`horror`, 39047-39052; docs/phase7-wave6.md §7.4).
 *
 * **The Mojo Files** is a SHOW environment: it discards the other SETTING environments and surges only when revealed
 * from the encounter deck (§3.64, insert p. 18). "Each ally takes -1 consequential damage after attacking a minion" is
 * a scoped `reduceDamageTaken` (§3.31): the `if` reads the attack's `attack.target`, so an attack on the villain or a
 * thwart is untouched, and a consequential 0 stays 0.
 *
 * **Bandolier of Stakes** attaches to the revealing player's identity at the schema level (`attachesTo`, resolved by
 * the reveal before this card's When Revealed, as Dead or Alive's is); the "you may spend 1 resource" is the optional
 * payment, and "Otherwise, discard this card" is the declined branch. Its interrupt names the host ("your hero"), not
 * "you": an encounter card has no controller, so `controller: you` would match nothing (ally attacks are not offered it).
 *
 * **Cultist** searches the encounter deck and discard pile for The Kraken, puts it into play engaged with the player
 * Cultist attacked, shuffles, then discards Cultist only if The Kraken was found (a printed "Then": a required choice that finds nothing skips it).
 *
 * **Vampire**: "Attacks with piercing deal double damage" is `doubleDamageTaken` with `attackKeyword: "piercing"`
 * (§3.68, RRG 1.8 "Modifiers" p. 29: additions come before doubling). Its heal reports the damage healed, and the tough
 * status card is given only when none was.
 *
 * **Werewolf Pack**: the ally is defeated (so its own When Defeated and the defeat responses happen), then tucked
 * facedown from its owner's discard pile (the Operation Zero Tolerance shape, FAQ RRG 1.8 p. 63). The Forced Interrupt
 * replaces the defeat only while an ally is beneath it: with none, there is nothing to discard and it is defeated.
