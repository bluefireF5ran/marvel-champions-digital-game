/**
 * MojoMania (`mojo`), the Western genre set (`western` 39066-39070, docs/phase7-wave6.md §7.4): Wild Wild Mojo (the
 * SHOW environment), Dead or Alive, Card Shark, Gunslinger (x2) and A Game of Cards.
 *
 * **Wild Wild Mojo**: "Each enemy attack gains overkill" grants the keyword to the attack, not to the enemy making it
 * (`attacksGainKeywords`, RRG 1.8 "Overkill", p. 31: "an attack with the overkill keyword"). "When a character
 * takes damage, increase that damage by 1" is a forced interrupt to any damage event: the overkill spill is a damage
 * event of its own, so it gets its own +1 (RRG 1.8 FAQ "Wild Wild Mojo (#66)", p. 64). An ally's consequential damage
 * is a damage event too; a consequential 0 stays 0 (insert p. 18; `applyDamage` ignores an amount of 0). The surge is
 * only for a reveal that began at the encounter deck (§3.64, insert p. 18: not from the show deck, not by the Wheel
 * of Genres).
 *
 * **Dead or Alive** attaches at the schema level (`attachesTo`, resolved by the reveal before this card's When
 * Revealed); only "if you cannot, this card gains surge" is scripted, as Razor Claws does (`27059`).
 *
 * **Card Shark** and **A Game of Cards** count printed resource types with `resourceTypesOf` (wild is a type of its own).
