/**
 * The Acolytes modular set (`acolytes`, `mut_gen` 32159-32165, MC32 p. 7 / p. 15, docs/phase7-wave6.md §2.2): five
 * Acolyte minions, Zeal for the Cause and The Acolytes side scheme. Teamwork (ACOLYTE), Stalwart, Retaliate, Toughness,
 * Villainous and the side scheme's Hinder-free text are data keywords (§3.1: the engine reads the `teamwork` keyword,
 * only the minion that just entered activates, §4.1 Q1; revealed, it activates after its When Revealed, RRG 1.8
 * p. 43, the owner's answer 30B of 2026-10-12 over §4.1 Q2).
 *
 * Every When Defeated reads "the player who defeated X": `defeatingPlayer`, which Zeal for the Cause's
 * `resolveWhenDefeatedOf` sets to the player resolving it (§4.1 Q10). "Is already confused/stunned" is read before the
 * status is given, so an ability's own status card never counts (`isConfused` / `isStunned` honor steady).
 *
 * **Fabian Cortez**: putting the found minion into play is the last effect, so he is discarded as it enters and its
 * teamwork does not see him (RRG FAQ "Fabian Cortez (#159)", p. 64).
