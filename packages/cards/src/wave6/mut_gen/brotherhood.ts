/**
 * The Brotherhood modular encounter set (`brotherhood`, `mut_gen` 32073-32079, MC32 p. 7 / p. 15, docs/phase7-wave6.md
 * §2.2): the four Brotherhood of Mutants minions (Avalanche, Blob, Pyro, Toad), Homo Superior, Mutant Terrorists and The
 * Brotherhood side scheme. The same four characters are also villains in Mansion Attack (32121-32124, scripted with that
 * scenario); Hinder, Guard and the keywords printed on the cards are data.
 *
 * Every Forced Response here reads "after X attacks you / damages a character": `after.enemyAttacks("self", ...)` with
 * `againstYou` for "attacks you" (the attacked player is the one the effect's "you" is, Sinister Assault's Hobgoblin) and
 * `damages` plus a check on `eventTarget` for "a character you control" (Kraven's shape: the trigger pattern would
 * resolve "you" against an uncontrolled card).
 *
 * **Mutant Terrorists**: "If it did not enter play this way" is the search finding no copy of The Brotherhood
 * (`selectCards.count` 0); the encounter deck is shuffled before the discard-until step, as printed.
