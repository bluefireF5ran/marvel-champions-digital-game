/**
 * Wave 6 rules QA, Colossus (`docs/phase7-wave6-qa-colossus-shadowcat.md`). Two parts.
 *
 * 1. Rulings that touch a card of Colossus's kit, his nemesis set (Juggernaut) or the box's shared precon cards.
 *    Already pinned exactly by another test, so not copied here:
 *    - FAQ "Mutant Protectors (#17)" (RRG 1.8 p. 63) first half: `../precon-player-cards.test.ts` "announces only the
 *      ally as the defender" and, for the second half, "the ally leaves play before damage".
 *    - FAQ "Powerful Punch (#14)" (p. 63): `../precon-player-cards.test.ts` "Powerful Punch (32014)" and, with Shadowcat's
 *      mass form, `../shadowcat/e2e.test.ts` "Powerful Punch (FAQ #14 ...)"; Shadowcat's own QA file adds the Phased half.
 *    - Ruling July 9, 2026 (1) (redirecting with Powerful Punch is not "initiated against you"): `../precon-player-cards
 *      .test.ts` "Powerful Punch (32014) when another player is attacked".
 *    - Erratum p. 68, Armor Up ("When the villain would activate"): `events.test.ts` "Armor Up (32010)".
 *    - FAQ "Magik" (p. 64, Mutant Protectors puts into play, does not play): `../precon-player-cards.test.ts` (cardPlayed
 *      is the Protectors alone).
 *    - RRG "Tough" (p. 44) and "Piercing" (p. 32) in Colossus's own terms, two tough cards, Juggernaut's piercing boost and
 *      Unstoppable's: `obligation-nemesis.test.ts`, `e2e.test.ts`. The cases below are the interactions those leave open.
 *    The erratum for Steel Fist (p. 68) is tested below (it found a missing label, since fixed).
 * 2. Whole games with Colossus's precon, 2 players standard (with Shadowcat, the box's other hero) and 1 hero expert,
 *    played by the greedy driver and replayed deep-equal, each containing his signature tough mechanic.

/**
 * Known issue 2 (browser play 2026-10-04, game 8): in the villain phase Colossus (alter-ego, Armor Up and Perseverance
 * in hand) played Armor Up; the response window to the form change listed "USE COLOSSUS" (Steel Skin, `32001a.colossus-
 * constant-2`) and "PLAY PERSEVERANCE" (`32016.perseverance-response`); after "USE COLOSSUS" the Perseverance button
 * was gone (`out-213`/`out-214`/`out-215`).
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Response" (p. 36): "Multiple responses may be triggered from the same triggering condition, but each
 * response may only be triggered once per occurrence of the triggering condition." and "Once all players decide they do
 * not wish to resolve any (further) responses to a triggering condition, (further) responses to that instance of that
 * triggering condition cannot be used." So the window stays open, and Perseverance stays playable, until the player
 * declines the rest. Colossus can hold 2 tough cards (his identity text), so Perseverance is legal after Steel Skin.
 *
 * Engine: `chooseTriggers` is one multi-select prompt (`resolve/window.ts` `askNextController`: min 0, max N), and the
 * client's inline interrupt window (`scenes/villain-phase.ts`, `#resolve([option.optionId])`) submits exactly one
 * option per button. The answer used to close the tier, forfeiting the unpicked response. Fixed 2026-10-09: once the
 * picked abilities have resolved, the ones left are offered again (`Frame<"window">.pickedThisRound`), until a round in
 * which nobody picks.
