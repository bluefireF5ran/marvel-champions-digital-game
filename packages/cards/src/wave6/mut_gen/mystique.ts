 * **Infiltration / Shapeshifter Surprise** (MC32 p. 7): When Revealed shuffles the card into the revealing player's
 * deck (it is the encounter card's own move, so it stays an unowned encounter card there) and it gains surge. Drawn, it
 * stays in the hand (`MYSTIQUE_SCENARIO_RULES`, §4.1 Q7) and its Forced Response answers `cardEntersHand`. A discard
 * from the hand goes to the encounter discard pile.
