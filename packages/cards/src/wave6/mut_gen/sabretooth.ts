 * The Sabretooth scenario's own encounter set (`mut_gen` 32060-32072, MC32 p. 7, docs/phase7-wave6.md §2.2): the
 * villain (32060-32062), the main scheme Stalked by Sabretooth / The Injured Senator (32063a/b, 32064a/b), Find the
 * Senator and the Protect the Senator environment it flips into (32065a/b), Robert Kelly (32066), Adamantium Claws,
 * Animal Ferocity, Sabretooth Strikes, Unrelenting Savage, Medical Emergency and Feral Rage. Not the Brotherhood or
 * Mystique modular sets.
 *
 * **Robert Kelly** is a scenario-specific ally with no encounter set: the scenario builder sets him aside
 * (`../setup.ts`'s `SETASIDE_BY_SCENARIO`) and 32063a's Setup attaches him to Find the Senator. While he is attached
 * his own text is blank (32063b), so Stalked by Sabretooth carries the "leaves play: the players lose" rule and Find the
 * Senator carries the heal and attachment restrictions.
 *
 * **Attached, he is an ally in play under no player's control** (32063a; docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.75): in no play area,
 * so no player attacks, thwarts or defends with him and "an ally you control" / "a friendly character" does not reach
 * him (ruling Jun 25, 2026 (4) #5), while an encounter card that names him ("Deal 2 damage to Robert Kelly", "Heal 2
 * damage from Robert Kelly") does, and lethal damage defeats him. A player card that says only "an ally" can still
 * choose him (RRG 1.8 "In Play and Out of Play", p. 23); the printed restrictions are what stop its heal or upgrade.
 * The Injured Senator's "When Completed: Defeat Robert Kelly" resolves before that final stage's completion loses the
 * game (RRG 1.8 "When Completed Abilities", p. 48), so his leaving play is what ends it.
 *
 * **Q4 (docs/phase7-wave6.md §4.1)**: Robert Kelly's Forced Interrupt reads literally: "against you" is his
 * controller, the first player, and only an undefended attack. An undefended attack on another player is not
 * redirected.
