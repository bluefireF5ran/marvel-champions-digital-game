 * Shadowcat's supports, upgrades and allies, and her Aggressive Energy resource (`mut_gen` 32032-32036, 32041-32044,
 * 32047-32049; docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.8, §3.11, §3.22). Her events are `events.ts`.
 *
 * - **Lockheed (32032) / Kitty's Room (32033)**: "if you are in Solid / Phased mass form" reads the mass form upgrade's
 *   face (`inAdditionalForm`). A target is chosen only in the branch that applies. Each is one ref carrying the header and both bullets.
 * - **Acute Control (32034) / Intangible Interference (32035)**: `on.youIgnore` (§3.8, Q6) is heard once per card
 *   whose keyword or icon would have stopped her attack or thwart; "that minion / scheme" is the event's card.
 * - **Phased and Confused (32036)**: Webbed Up's shape (`01009`): the attack is cancelled, the card discarded, and
 *   then the enemy is confused.
 * - **Wolverine (32041)**: his own attacks (basic or not) gain piercing; the heal is the plain "Response", so it is
 *   heard in either form.
 * - **Magik (32042)**: "an X-MEN hero" is a player whose identity currently has the X-MEN trait, so a player in
 *   alter-ego form is not one (the alter-ego face carries MUTANT, not X-MEN). Flagged for review.
 * - **Gatekeeper (32044)**: one `-constant` for the two grants (+2 hit points and patrol).
 * - **Aggressive Energy (32047)**: `modifyCardEffect` on the event being played (the Embiggen! shape).
 * - **Colossus (32048)**: Toughness is data; the cost reduction is read from hand (Martinex's shape).
 * - **X-Mansion (32049)**: `triggerableBy` replaces the controller rule, so its controller may trigger it only when
 *   their own alter-ego is MUTANT (the literal reading of §3.11).
