/**
 * Wave 6 rules QA, Rogue pack (`docs/phase7-wave6-qa-gambit-rogue.md`). Two parts.
 *
 * 1. Errata, FAQ entries and rulings that touch a card of the pack (Rogue, her nemesis set, the Reavers modular set).
 *    Already pinned exactly by a module test, so not copied here:
 *    - Erratum RRG 1.8 p. 69, Anna Marie (#1A), "Setup: Find your Touched upgrade and set it aside. Withdrawn ...": `rogue/
 *      identity.test.ts` "38001b.setup (Anna Marie)" and "38001b.withdrawn (Anna Marie)".
 *    - Erratum p. 69, Rogue (#1B) and Energy Transfer (#7), "Find Touched and attach it to ...": `rogue/identity.test.ts`
 *      "38001a.skin-contact" ("finds Touched wherever it is: in her hand, and already attached elsewhere") and `rogue/
 *      events.test.ts` "Energy Transfer (38007)" (set aside, hand, moving between hosts).
 *    - Erratum p. 69, Mystique's Manipulations (#26), "The defeating player searches ...": `rogue/obligation-nemesis.test.ts`
 *      "38026.when-defeated" (the first player is not the defeating one; a set-aside Misled is not found).
 *    - Erratum p. 69, Bonebreaker (#31), Forced Interrupt to Forced Response: `reavers/index.test.ts` "38031.bonebreaker-
 *      forced-response" (1 and 2 Reavers engaged).
 *    - Ruling Jan 17, 2026 (3) #1 and RRG "Prevent" (p. 35) for Bulletproof Belle with a plain attacker: `rogue/events.test.ts`
 *      "Bulletproof Belle (38008)". The Piercing half is below.
 *    - Superpower Adaptation's event goes back to its owner's discard pile (RRG "Ownership and Control", p. 31; Q29):
 *      `rogue/events.test.ts` "the card stays P2's: played by Rogue, it goes to P2's discard pile, not hers".
 *    - Touched on another player's hero is controlled by that player (RRG p. 31, owner decision 2026-10-03) and still
 *      grants Rogue stalwart: `rogue/identity.test.ts` "Hero in a 2-player game: Touched on P2's hero is controlled by P2".
 *    - Energy Transfer's damage is a cost, paid when a tough card prevents it (RRG "Cost" p. 14, "Prevent" p. 35): `rogue/
 *      events.test.ts` "the 2 damage is a cost: a tough card on the host stops it". The cannot-take-damage host is below.
 *    - Ruling Jan 17, 2026 (1) (Rogue ally copying Hope Summers) and erratum p. 69 Rogue (#12) are the Nightcrawler Hero
 *      Pack's Rogue ally, not a card of this pack. Ruling Dec 17, 2025 (4) #2 (Med Lab 38028): the engine's
 *      `tuck-ref-target.test.ts` and `rogue/support-upgrades-allies.test.ts` "Med Lab (38028)".
 *    New below: Bulletproof Belle against Piercing (ruling Jan 17, 2026 (3) #1), Not Today! with a tough status card (RRG
 *    p. 44, FAQ p. 56), Touched moving between hosts in one turn with Rogue's Jacket, Bulletproof Belle and the copied
 *    traits, Touched left on another player's hero across a round and moved by Skin Contact, Skin Contact finding
 *    Touched in the discard pile (RRG "Find" p. 19), Touched on Exodus behind a Psionic Shield, Energy Transfer onto a
 *    minion that cannot take damage (ruling Jan 26, 2026 (1)), Team-Up from the other hero, and Donald Pierce revealing
 *    Bonebreaker.
 * 2. Whole games with Rogue's precon: 2 players standard (with Gambit) and 1 hero expert, played by the greedy driver and
 *    replayed deep-equal, asserting Skin Contact and Touched's set-aside resolved; one more game with the Reavers set.
