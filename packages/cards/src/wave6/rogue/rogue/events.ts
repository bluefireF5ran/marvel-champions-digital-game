/**
 * Rogue's events (`rogue` 38005-38009), docs/phase7-wave6.md §6.2, §3.48-§3.51.
 *
 * - **Goin' Rogue (38005) / Southern Cross (38006)**: the amount and each bullet are read from Rogue as the effect
 *   resolves, so what Touched and Skin Contact give her counts. The AERIAL bullet is one removal / one attack of the
 *   larger amount ("2 additional"). Retaliate's confuse (an enemy of her choosing) and stun (that enemy, if it is
 *   still in play after the attack) and Stalwart's draw are separate bullets, each applying on its own.
 * - **Energy Transfer (38007)**: RRG 1.8 erratum p. 69, "Find Touched and attach it to a character other than Rogue
 *   and deal 2 damage to that character → ...". Attaching and the 2 damage are the cost (paid even if the damage is
 *   prevented, RRG p. 14); the heal, ready and trait grant are the effect. The grant ends at the end of the round or
 *   when Touched leaves that host (§4 Q28).
 * - **Bulletproof Belle (38008)**: "an enemy with Touched attached to it" is read from where Touched is; the damage is
 *   prevented on the attack itself, the tough card goes to Rogue.
 * - **Preemptive Strike (38015)** reprints `msm` 05014 verbatim and **Beauty and the Thief (38020)** is the same title
 *   and text as Gambit's 37019 (Team-Up (Gambit and Rogue) is data): both alias the original script.
 * - **Not Today! (38016)**: "If you take no damage from that attack" is read when the attack ends, from the attack's
 *   own damage TAKEN by your identity (`atEndOfAttack` + `eventDamageTaken`, the Never Back Down / Desperate Defense
 *   shape); damage a tough status card prevents is dealt but not taken (RRG 1.8 "Tough", p. 44), so it does not block
 *   the reward. The threat removal is not a thwart.
 * - **Superpower Adaptation (38009)**: "friendly" is an identity or ally; the search reads the host owner's discard
 *   pile and the card goes to your hand but stays its owner's (§4 Q29). The arrow's search is an effect here:
 *   `chooseCardCost` reads only the payer's own zone, so another player's discard pile is out of its reach (reported).
