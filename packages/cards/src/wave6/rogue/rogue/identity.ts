 * - **Setup (38001b)**, **Withdrawn (38001b)** and Rogue's **Forced Response (38001a)**: "find Touched and set it
 *   aside" wherever it is (RRG 1.8 errata p. 69; "Find", p. 19). Her response is printed on the hero face, so it only
 *   hears the player phase beginning in hero form.
 * - **Skin Contact (38001a)**: "Find Touched and attach it to another character. You gain each of the attached
 *   character's TRAITS until the end of the round." The copy follows the chosen character, not Touched: it ends at the end
 *   of the round or when that character leaves play, and Touched moving does not end it (FFG ruling October 9, 2026 -
 *   Ruling 1, which revises Q28's old `whileAttached`).
 * - **Touched (38002)**: minion, Rogue's attacks gain overkill; villain, Rogue gains retaliate 1; ally, Rogue gains
 *   AERIAL; hero (a hero-form identity), Rogue gains stalwart. Each is read live from the host. Four refs, one line
 *   of text each.
