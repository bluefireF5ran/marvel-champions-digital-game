 * Rogue's allies, supports, upgrades and resources (`rogue` 38003, 38004, 38010-38014, 38017-38019, 38021-38023,
 * 38028), docs/phase7-wave6.md §6.2. Her events are `events.ts`.
 *
 * - **Gambit (38003)**: enters play with 3 charge counters; his interrupt removes one as a cost and deals 1 damage to
 *   an enemy of the player's choosing (any enemy, not only the one he is attacking).
 * - **Rogue's Jacket (38004)**: two constants on Rogue herself, each live while Touched sits on a friendly (identity or
 *   ally) or an enemy (villain or minion) character.
 * - **Iceman (38010)**: after any minion enters play, one freeze counter off him is the cost to stun it.
 * - **Karma (38011)**: after you play her from your hand, a non-ELITE minion is taken as a CONTROLLED ally for as long
 *   as she stays in play (`treatAsAlly`, wave 4 §3.29).
 * - **Armor (38012)**: Toughness and the X-MEN play restriction are card data, no ability.
 * - **Judoka Skill (38014)**: uses (3 judo counters) is data; the enemy gets -2 ATK for that attack only.
 * - **Moira MacTaggert (38018)**: the identity's traits before the change are read (§3.56), so a MUTANT alter-ego
 *   triggers it; the hero's controller, not necessarily Moira's, draws.
 * - **X-Gene (38019)**: a wild resource for an identity-specific event of the player's own set.
 * - **Med Lab (38028)**: "an ally" is any player's (the card says neither "you control" nor "your"), defeated by its own
 *   consequential damage; "place it here" tucks it from wherever the defeat left it (the discard pile, or a hand it
 *   was returned to), never from the removed-from-game area (ruling Dec 17, 2025 (4) #2: the response then has no
 *   target and is not offered). "(Limit 1 ally at a time.)" is the response's `while` (§3.57): with an ally already
 *   here it is not offered and Med Lab is not exhausted. The action plays the tucked ally as if from hand, at its cost,
 *   exhausted (RRG 1.8 "Tuck", p. 45; "Play, Put Into Play", p. 32). "Max 1 per player" is card data.
 * - **Reprints, aliased**: Unflappable 38013 (`drs` 09020) and Defensive Energy 38017 (`mut_gen` 32018).
