/**
 * The Shadow King modular set (`shadow_king`, `storm` 36036-36039; docs/phase7-wave6.md §2, §3.58): The Shadow King
 * (minion), Ruler of the Astral Plane (side scheme), Possessed x2 (attachment) and Astral Attack (treachery).
 *
 * - A CONTROLLED minion is an ally an attached Possessed treats as a minion (Beguiled's shape, `treatHostAsMinion`);
 *   no card in this set makes any other kind of CONTROLLED minion.
 * - **Possessed** (erratum, RRG 1.8 p. 68): "Attached ally engages its controller" is the Beguiled model; the host is
 *   `attachesTo` data (lowest THW without Possessed), and no host means the card gains surge.
 * - **Astral Attack**: every CONTROLLED minion in play activates, engaged with the player or not.
