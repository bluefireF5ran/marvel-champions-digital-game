 * Storm's identity-specific upgrades and supports (`storm` 36006-36008), her Leadership allies, supports and upgrades
 * (36016-36020, 36022-36026) and her basic and Leadership cards (36035, "To Me, My X-Men!" 36020), docs/phase7-wave6.md
 * §6.2, §3.58. Her events are `events.ts`, her WEATHER supports `weather.ts`.
 *
 * - **Reprints, aliased**: Effective Leadership 36021 (`33018`), The X-Jet 36023 (`32020`), Utopia 36024 (`33020`),
 *   X-Mansion 36025 (`32049`) and Endurance 36026 (`05023`).
 * - **Storm's Crown (36006) / Cape (36007)**: "Storm" is her hero face (`isHero`). The Crown's resource is the printed
 *   resource of her WEATHER support in play; the Cape's response hears any ability resolved on it (its Special).
 * - **Ororo's Garden (36008)**: alter-ego form only, heals her identity.
 * - **Havok (36014)**: any attack he makes (basic or not). "+1 ATK for this attack" is the attack's own `atkBonus`; his
 *   printed attack consequential damage is 0, so `modifyConsequentialDamage` creates the damage beneath the attack
 *   (`insertConsequentialDamage`) rather than changing a pending one. No boost icon, no change.
 * - **Mirage (36015)**: the enemy's current SCH against Mirage's current THW (`statCompare`), read as the target is
 *   chosen; with no such enemy the response has no target and is not offered.
 * - **Gentle (36016)**: +1 consequential damage only from an attack on the villain (the attack's reported target).
 * - **Pixie (36017)**: any play of Pixie (hand or otherwise): `cardPlayed` is a play, not a put into play.
 * - **Uncanny X-Men (36018)**: "Max 1 TEAM card per player" is card data (`playRestrictions.maxWithTrait`, §3.28). The
 *   cost reduction needs every character you control to be X-MEN, your identity included (§4.1 Q31): in alter-ego
 *   form (MUTANT) it does not apply; the +1 hit point always does.
 * - **Leadership Skill (36019)**: the counter is the cost; +1 to whichever of THW or ATK the ally's basic power uses.
 * - **"To Me, My X-Men!" (36020)**: a search of the top 5 only, so no shuffle; the ally goes to hand at the end of the
 *   phase only if it is still in play then.
 * - **Forge (36022)**: deck and discard pile, then shuffled.
 * - **Hangar Bay (36035)**: heard after an ally's defense, and only when the attack defeated no one (`resultsAtMost`, part of
 *   the trigger condition, so the cost is never paid for a defeated ally).
