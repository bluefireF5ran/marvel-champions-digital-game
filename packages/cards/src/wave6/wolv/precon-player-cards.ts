/**
 * The Wolverine pack's aspect and basic cards no hero folder owns (`wolv` 35013-35015, 35017-35023, 35032, 35033;
 * docs/phase7-wave6.md §6.1, §3.44).
 *
 * - **Reprints, aliased**: Battle Fury 35015 (`06018`), Mean Swing 35019 (`06015`), Aggressive Energy 35020 (`32047`,
 *   "that event deals 1 additional damage", `modifyCardEffect`) and Colossus 35021 (`32048`).
 * - **Psylocke (35013)**: enters play with 2 psionic counters (the Hawkeye shape); her interrupt costs one and confuses
 *   and damages the attacked enemy before the attack resolves.
 * - **Sunfire (35014)**: "an attachment with the text Hero Action or Hero Response" reads `TargetQuery.abilityTiming`
 *   (wave 4 §3.33) over every attachment in play. "Attachment" is an encounter card type (RRG 1.8 "Attachment",
 *   p. 8): a player upgrade, Berserker Frenzy's Hero Response included, is not one. With no eligible attachment in
 *   play the response is not offered (a chosen target is required to resolve it).
 * - **Outta My Way! (35017)**: 5 damage instead of 3 against a guard or patrol enemy, read on the chosen enemy.
 * - **Weapon X (35022)**: "take 1 damage" is a cost; the deck is discarded until an identity-specific card of your own
 *   set turns up, which is then added to your hand (nothing found, nothing added).
 * - **Fastball Special (35023)**: X is the total ATK of Colossus and Wolverine (those in play), overkill and piercing.
 * - **Command Center (35032)**: heard when an ally's thwart defeats a side scheme (the schemeDefeated event's source).
 * - **Longshot (35033)**: after his attack on a non-ELITE minion, discards the top encounter card; a star icon in its
 *   boost area defeats the minion (`<bind>.starIcons`, RRG 1.8 "Boost, Boost Icon", p. 11).
