 * Angel's events: Adaptive Plumage 42003, Aerial Agility 42004, Metamorphosis 42005, Natural Flight 42006, Razor Dive
 * 42007, Aerial Intervention 42014, Ever Vigilant 42015, Taunt 42016 and Soaring Hearts 42021
 * (docs/phase7-wave7.md §7.2, §3.62, §3.67; §4.2 Q37, Q41, Q42). His precon (`angel-protection`) against Stryfe through
 * `wave7Scenario` with the real registry. Faces: Warren (`alterEgo`), Angel (`heroForm: 0`: THW 2, ATK 1, DEF 2),
 * Archangel (`heroForm: 1`: THW 0, ATK 2, DEF 3). Stryfe's starting tough status card is removed (`game`) so an attack
 * is not absorbed. Angel of Life draws 1 and Angel of Death deals the AERIAL event's printed cost: both are exercised
 * here against each event.
 *
 * One fixture: Techno-Organic Wings' own ref is replaced by its Archangel reduction alone (no exhaust cost, no
 * form branch), so the printed-cost reading of Angel of Death has a reduced cost to be tested against.
