/**
 * Whole games with Angel's precon (`angel-protection`, cards 42001a/b/c-42023) through the real engine and the real
 * wave 7 scripts, played by the card-name-agnostic greedy driver (`../../testing/driver.ts`) one command at a time, so
 * that every state is checked against the invariants below (the same ones as `cable-precon-e2e.test.ts`):
 *
 * - no engine error on a command the driver chose from legal candidates (`sessionApply` reports it);
 * - no prompt without an answer (RRG 1.8 "Choices"): `minSelections` fits the options offered;
 * - the game never stops between steps with nothing pending: the villain phase always completes (RRG Appendix II,
 *   "Villain Phase", pp. 51-52) and rounds advance by exactly one;
 * - the player side scheme limit is one for one or two starting players (RRG 1.8 "Player Side Scheme Limit", p. 34);
 * - no card instance sits in two zones; every card a player's deck started with is still somewhere; cards stay in their
 *   owner's zones (RRG 1.8 "Owner", "Controller", p. 31);
 * - no two matching unique cards, and no unique card matching a chosen identity, are in play together (RRG 1.8
 *   "Unique Icon", p. 45: the Angel identity, alter-ego title Warren Worthington III, matches an Angel ally; the
 *   Psylocke identity, alter-ego title Betsy Braddock, matches the Psylocke ally);
 * - a player changes form voluntarily at most once a round (RRG 1.8 "Form", "Change Form");
 * - the first player token passes to the next seat at the end of each round (RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 20);
 * - the session log replays to the identical final state.
 *
 * Deviations from the driver, all policy and none about the rules: Hope Summers is never declared a defender (Stryfe:
 * "If Hope Summers is defeated, you lose"), no Morlock defends in Morlock Siege (2B: "no Morlock allies in play"), a
 * turn is ended after 40 commands, and Angel's form change is chosen here: the driver's only form command is the bare
 * `changeForm`, which a three-face identity refuses from Warren Worthington III (it names no face), so on its own it
 * never leaves alter-ego (see "driver finding" below). The test picks the hero face (Angel and Archangel alternately)
 * and, every third round, switches between the two hero faces, so that all three faces and all six legal changes occur.
