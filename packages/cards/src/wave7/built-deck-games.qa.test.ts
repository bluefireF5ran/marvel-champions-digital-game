/**
 * Wave 7 rules-QA: full solo games with real built decks, played to a real outcome (docs/phase7-wave7-qa-built-deck-games.md).
 *
 * The six MarvelCDB decklists of `fixtures/decklists/` (imported as `custom-decks-marvelcdb.test.ts` does) against the
 * five NeXt Evolution scenarios in standard mode, one seat (the easiest table: villain hit points and the main
 * scheme's threat scale per player), driven by the QA solo driver (`qa-solo-driver.ts`), which picks only from
 * `legalActions` and the options of the open choice.
 *
 * What the committed test does (it must stay fast; the wide scan lives in the doc and in the `QA_FULL` block):
 *
 * - `PINS`: one game per pairing (6 x 5): a win where the scratch scans found one (1 pairing now; X-23 / Mister Sinister lost its win to the Permanent ruling, p. 32), otherwise the quickest
 *   game seen (Deadpool / Morlock Siege was a win until a removal of threat could no longer target a scheme with no
 *   threat, RRG 1.8 "Target" p. 42; a rescan of seeds 1-12 x explore 0-8 x both defenses, 216 games, found no win), each named by (seed, driver defense mode, explore). Each is played command by command with the invariants below, replayed from its log to a
 *   deep-equal state, and its outcome and round count asserted exactly (the table is the regression signal: any engine,
 *   script or content change that moves a seeded game shows up here as a changed row).
 * - Wins additionally assert the win condition by its rule, the final state (game over, winner, victory display) and
 *   the villain's final stage.
 * - `QA_FULL=1` scans seeds 1-12 per pairing with the invariants only (360 games, about half an hour in one process).
 *
 * The pins are tied to the engine and content at the time of writing (`dc26910a`): a change that moves a seeded game moves
 * its row, which is the point; re-pin from the scan in the doc, not by editing the expectation to match.
 *
 * Invariants on every command (RRG 1.8 pages in parentheses):
 * - no engine refusal of a driver command, no soft lock: a prompt always has at least `minSelections` options, and the
 *   game never rests between steps with nothing pending (Appendix II, pp. 51-52); the game ends inside the command cap;
 * - no card instance in two zones; every card a deck started with is still somewhere (Owner, Controller, p. 31) and in
 *   its owner's zones;
 * - no two matching unique cards (or a unique card matching a chosen identity) in play together (Unique Icon, p. 45);
 * - the arithmetic of every enemy attack and scheme (`checkArithmetic`);
 * - at most one player side scheme in play, for one or two players (Player Side Scheme Limit, p. 34);
 * - a voluntary form change at most once a round (Form, p. 20);
 * - the log replays to the identical final state.
