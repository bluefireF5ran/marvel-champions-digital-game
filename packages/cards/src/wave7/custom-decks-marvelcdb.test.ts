/**
 * Wave 7 definition-of-done 4b, piece 3 (docs/wave-definition-of-done.md, docs/custom-deck-testing.md "The pieces"): one
 * real public MarvelCDB decklist per new hero, imported with the existing importer against the wave 7 pool, legal under
 * `validateDeck`, and played by the seeded greedy driver in a scenario the hero's precon is not tied to, with a
 * deep-equal replay.
 *
 * Fixtures: `fixtures/decklists/<hero>.json`, each fetched on 2026-10-05 from
 * `GET https://marvelcdb.com/api/public/decklist/<id>.json` (compact JSON re-serialized; the only field changed is the
 * long `description_md`, emptied at first and restored on 2026-10-10: the Decks screen shows it as the author's notes). Each was chosen as the most-liked public
 * decklist for that hero (MarvelCDB `decklists/find?hero=<code>&sort=likes`, the first twelve per hero, 2026-10-05)
 * that imports in full against the wave 7 pool. "Packs" are the packs of the cards the importer resolved (a reprint
 * counts as its original pack), and every one of them is in the wave 7 pool.
