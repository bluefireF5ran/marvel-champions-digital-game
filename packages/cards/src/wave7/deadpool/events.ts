/**
 * Deadpool's signature events (44003-44006, 44012) and the 'Pool events 44017-44023: docs/phase7-wave7.md §7.3.
 *
 * - **Exhausting Personality (44003)**: a choice between two cost-then-effect branches. The second is offered only
 *   while some identity is ready (its cost can be paid), and the identity may be any player's (June 2, 2026 - Ruling 5).
 * - **Maximum Effort (44004) / "Yoo-Hoo!" (44006)**: the payer picks the damage (0 to remaining hit points, Q46 = B);
 *   the effect reads it as `cost.damageSelf`. Taking all of it "defeats" him, his own forced interrupt replaces that,
 *   and the effect still resolves from alter-ego form (the form is checked on initiation).
 * - **Metaknowledge (44005)**: the icons are counted before the card is cancelled and discarded.
 * - **This Card is Fire (44012)**: the forced response is `inHand` and hears the end of its controller's turn the way
 *   Sap Power (21029) does; X is read when the attack resolves.
 * - **Barely a Scratch (44017), Da Bomb (44019), 'Pool Inspection (44023)**: the four encounter icons counted across
 *   every card in play (§3.77). Da Bomb and 'Pool Inspection read the count once, after their first sentence.
 * - **"I Got This" (44021)**: the four icon lines are the body of the one Hero Action (the data emits them as four
 *   constant refs, a card-data fix, see coverage.test.ts), resolved in the order the player chooses (ruling #176).
 * - **Not my Responsibility (44022)**: "you or your ally" is a choice among the controller's identity and the allies
 *   the controller controls; `taken` so that no "additional damage" bonus applies (nothing deals it).
