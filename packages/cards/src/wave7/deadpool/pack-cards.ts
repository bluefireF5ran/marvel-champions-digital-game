/**
 * The deadpool pack's aspect and basic cards no hero kit owns (44031, 44043-44058), docs/phase7-wave7.md §7.3, §3.77,
 * §3.82-§3.84, §3.87.
 *
 * - **Frenemies (44031)**: the same card as the box's 40026 (§3.61): that definition, aliased. Team-Up is data.
 * - **Bob (44043)**: Response after he enters play; a choice between damage to an enemy and a removal from a scheme
 *   (neither is an attack or a thwart). The acceleration icon is data.
 * - **Negasonic Teenage Warhead (44044)**: an ally's Interrupt (any player's hero is protected), paid by 2 damage to
 *   her. The hazard icon is data. **Pandapool (44045)** prints Toughness and an icon only: no ability ref.
 * - **Break Time (44046)**: Alliance and the per-player cost are data. The player who plays it reports the minutes
 *   away (Q49: whole minutes, no cap; `reportFact`), then every identity heals that many. The client cannot ask yet.
 * - **Get in Front of Me! (44047)**: Get Behind Me!'s shape (01078). "If an ally or another hero defends this attack"
 *   reads the attack's `defender` slot through its bind: an ally of any player, or the identity of any other player. A
 *   defender who has left play by then still counts (the character did defend, RRG "Defend, Defense", p. 16).
 * - **Mulligan (44048)**: "You cannot play this card if you have played another card this phase" is a `playOnlyIf`
 *   over `playedThisPhase`, the player's own plays this phase: a card they played in an earlier turn of the same
 *   player phase, or during another player's turn, counts (RRG 1.8 "Player Phase", p. 34: one phase).
 * - **Deadpool Corps Ship (44049)**: the cost deals the player 1 facedown encounter card; any 'Pool ally in hand.
 * - **Plot Convenience (44050)**: `triggerableBy: eachPlayer`; the triggering player attaches from their hand or takes
 *   any attached card into their own hand, whoever owns it, and it stays its owner's (Q53 = A, `takeIntoHand` with
 *   `keepOwner`; spent or discarded from that hand it goes to its owner's discard pile, RRG 1.8 p. 31). The data's constant ref ("Any
 *   player may trigger this ability.") is part of the Action. An aspect card includes 'Pool (spec §3.73).
 * - **Ambush (44051), Distraction (44054)**: crisis icon and "Max 1 per ..." are data.
 * - **Bazooka (44052)**: Restricted is data; discarding it is the cost, the icons are read as the attack resolves.
 * - **Laser Swords (44055)**: "Counts as 2 restricted cards" is `restrictedWeight` (data). It is one restricted card
 *   weighing 2: text naming restricted cards sees it, and over the limit it is offered for the discard beside the
 *   keyword cards, freeing 2 (contributor's rules call 2026-10-16 (bluefireF5ran), reverses upstream Q52 = B). The ATK line
 *   is live (a stat bonus's amount stays live) and capped at +4.
 * - **Blackout (44053), Tic-Tac-Toe (44057)**: spaces are counters on the card (§3.84). One Action offers one option
 *   per resource type (the spend names its type, so a wild resource is spent as that type: Q51 = A); a type is offered
 *   only while a space of it is empty and a source exists. The move is a removal of threat or healing of damage, never
 *   a thwart or an attack; a move that moved nothing (no valid source) places no token.
 * - **Rock, Paper, Scissors (44056)**: the diagram is energy > mental > physical > energy, wild beats those three and
 *   nothing beats wild (§3.87). Choosing the card and discarding the top card are both costs.
 * - **War (44058)**: the encounter discard is not a reveal; the damage taken counts star and boost icons.
