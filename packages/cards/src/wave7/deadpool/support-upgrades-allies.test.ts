/**
 * Deadpool's allies, support, upgrades, resources and player side scheme (44002, 44007-44011, 44013-44016, 44024-44030),
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §7.3, §3.76, §3.78-§3.81, §3.83. Every game is Juggernaut (a villain with a tough status card)
 * with the 'Pool precon (`deadpool-pool`) in seat 1, past setup, in hero form, no threat on the main scheme. Seating
 * that deck brings Crisis of Infinite Deadpools 44037 into the encounter deck: no test here reveals an encounter card.
 *
 * Hands are set by surgery (`withHand`) so a payment is exactly `cost` one-icon filler cards (44021 x3, 44012 x2).
 * Fixtures from his own kit by printed id (this file's `DEPS` replaces their refs; they are other modules' cards, and
 * every one is cost 0 unless noted): 44003 deals 20 to your identity, 44004 deals 20 to every Dogpool, 44017 deals 20
 * to every Lady Deadpool, 44006 (cost 1) deals 20 to every other player's identity, and 44018 (cost 3) discards Armed
 * to the Teeth.
