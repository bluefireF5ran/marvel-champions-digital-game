/**
 * Deadpool's allies, support, upgrades, resources and player side scheme (44002, 44007-44011, 44013-44016,
 * 44024-44030): docs/phase7-wave7.md §7.3, §3.76, §3.78-§3.81, §3.83.
 *
 * - **Cable (44002)**: +1 THW and +1 ATK per acceleration token on the main scheme, to +3 (the token count, not icons).
 * - **Montage (44007)**: 1 additional [wild] per token to 3, added before any multiplier; the printed icon stays one.
 * - **Self Confidence / Control / Preservation (44025-44027)**: "sustained less than 5" is at most 4 damage on your
 *   identity right now; triple with none. The printed resource is multiplied (1, so 3 / 2 / 1).
 * - **Armed to the Teeth (44009)**: the search is the response; the Action swaps the attachment with a WEAPON upgrade
 *   you control (RRG "Swap", p. 42). Collection rule: spec Q47 = A. The facedown attachment is out of play (RRG "In
 *   Play and Out of Play", p. 23), so this is a swap between an in-play card and an out-of-play one.
 * - **Headpool (44014)**: the minion must still be in play, so the response needs the attack not to have defeated it.
 * - **It Ain't Over... (44011)**: +2 target threat per token on the attached main scheme (data host `mainScheme`).
 * - **Git Gud (44028)**: the cost reduction is read in hand (spec Q48: absent means did not win). The forced interrupt
 *   answers any player's identity defeat; it and Deadpool's own interrupt are both pending when he would be defeated,
 *   and the first one the first player orders replaces the defeat.
 * - **Live Dangerously (44024)**: Victory 0 and the icons are data; +2 hand size for every identity.
