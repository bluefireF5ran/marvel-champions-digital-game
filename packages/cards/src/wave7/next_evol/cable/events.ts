 * Cable's hero events (40002-40005), docs/phase7-wave7.md §7.1 and the §3.61 rows.
 *
 * - **Bodyslide (40002), Action**: change form, then each other player may change to the form Cable is now in. The
 *   change is an effect, not the once-per-round change (RRG "Form, Change Form", p. 21). A player already in that
 *   form, or who cannot change form, is not asked, except that one in a hero form with another hero face may change
 *   to it (FFG ruling June 8, 2023, #22: a Tiny Ant-Man may change to Giant).
 * - **Mind Scan (40003), Hero Action (thwart)**: remove 3 threat from a scheme, +1 per side scheme in the victory
 *   display. It is a thwart by Cable, so "after Cable defeats a scheme" hears it (RRG "You, Your", p. 49).
 * - **Precognition (40004), Hero Action**: look at the top X cards of the encounter deck (X = side schemes in the
 *   victory display), may discard 1, put the rest back in any order. X = 0 looks at nothing.
 * - **Telekinetic Blast (40005), Hero Action (attack)**: 6 damage to an enemy, +1 per side scheme in the victory
 *   display. An attack, so it needs an enemy Cable may attack (Guard) and Retaliate / Toughness apply.
