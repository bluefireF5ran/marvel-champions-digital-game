/**
 * The campaign cards (40190-40203), docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.43, §3.45-§3.48; MC40 pp. 6-7. Their own text only: the
 * campaign flow (which are put into play, shuffled in or set aside) is `campaigns/next_evol.ts`.
 *
 * - **The six player side schemes (40190a-40195a)**: no cost, 4 per player threat (data). The limit exemption is a
 *   constant on the scheme itself (owner ruling 2026-10-04: by its own text), and nobody controls it. Its When
 *   Defeated flips it; the environment then enters play (`flipToOtherFace`: "Enters play with" fires, the a face is
 *   gone). A permanent scheme is never defeated at 0 threat (none of these is permanent).
 * - **Environments (40190b-40195b)**: the `assembly`, `safehouse`, `pouch` and `prep` counters are an enters-play
 *   response. The Actions are any player's (December 17, 2025 - Ruling 1, answer 1); "each player" is every player in
 *   player order, whoever used it.
 * - **Team Assembled (40190b)**: each player may search for an ally of printed cost 3 or less (a dash or X cost reads
 *   as 0). The ally limit applies as for any ally put into play.
 * - **Mission Prepped (40193b)**: each player must find an upgrade of printed cost 2 or less, if the deck and discard
 *   pile hold one, and attaches it to their identity or an ally.
 * - **Geared Up (40192b) / Safehouse Established (40191b)**: the Pouches / Safehouse copies are campaign cards held in
 *   the campaign's set-aside pool (`encounterSetAside`), given to the player (ownership, `assignOwnerTo`) like Norn
 *   Stone (`wave4/mts/mts-campaign-cards.ts`). Pouches (40196) has no text.
 * - **Practiced Maneuvers (40194b), Prepared Defenses (40195b)**: constants. The +1 DEF and retaliate 1 are the hero
 *   form's only (an alter-ego is not a hero).
 * - **Safehouse (40197)**: any player may trigger the Alter-Ego Action; "your identity" and "draw" are the triggering
 *   player's (`triggerableBy`); the limit is once per round per player. The second ref is that same sentence.
 * - **Lady Mastermind (40198), Scrambler (40200), Vanisher (40201), Overburdened (40203)**: Surge is data. The revealing
 *   player is "you". A superlative reads the printed cost (a dash or X cost is 0, so no event in hand deals 0).
 * - **Under Pressure (40202)**: the boost gives the villain an additional boost card for this activation.
 * - **Malice (40199)**: see `MALICE_WHEN_DEFEATED`; its second ref is `MALICE_CONSTANT`.
