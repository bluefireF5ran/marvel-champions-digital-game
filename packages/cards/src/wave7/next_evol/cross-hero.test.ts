/**
 * "Cards in another hero's deck" (`docs/custom-deck-testing.md`, `docs/wave-definition-of-done.md` step 4b) for the
 * NeXt Evolution box's aspect and basic player cards: Cable's deck 40014-40025 and 40027-40030, Domino's deck
 * 40050-40064, and the basic ally Hope Summers 40204 (32 cards; 40026 Frenemies is a Team-Up card and out of this
 * slice, and the campaign-only cards 40079, 40130, 40190-40197 are not deck cards). Each is played from a Core hero's
 * deck (Captain Marvel for Leadership, She-Hulk for Aggression, Black Panther for Protection, Spider-Man for Justice
 * and basic) in a Morlock Siege game (Blockbuster, villain ATK 2). A card whose script quietly assumed its precon hero
 * (Cable or Domino: X-FORCE, PSIONIC, SOLDIER, a POSSE ally, E.V.A.'s Fantomex) is asserted both without what it
 * wants (refused or inert) and with it satisfied legitimately: an edited card pool (`identityTraits`, rules untouched)
 * or the supporting cards actually played (Fantomex before E.V.A.).
