 * Domino's hero events and Jackpot! (40040-40043), docs/phase7-wave7.md §7.1, §3.55, §3.56, §4.1 Q32, Q34.
 *
 * - **A Good Workout (40040), Hero Action (attack)**: choose an enemy, discard the top card of the deck, then one attack
 *   of 4 damage plus 1 per resource icon discarded (Domino's wild counts twice). Q34 = B: all the additional damage goes
 *   to the enemy the 4 damage was dealt to. Q32 = A (engine interpretation, owner decision 2026-10-17, issue #222): a
 *   card a response took away (Jackpot! shuffled back, Digging Deep to hand) still counts; no ruling uses this wording.
 * - **Luck Be a Lady (40041), Hero Action**: discard the top card; for each counted icon, [energy] heals 2 from a
 *   character, [mental] removes 2 threat from a scheme, [physical] deals 3 damage to an enemy, [wild] chooses one of
 *   those (a Domino-doubled wild is two choices). Resolved energy, then mental, then physical, then wild. The three
 *   bullet-line refs are ingestion artifacts of the one action.
 * - **Right Place, Right Time (40042), Hero Action (thwart)**: one thwart of 3 plus 1 per icon discarded, on the scheme.
 * - **Jackpot! (40043), Response**: "After this card is discarded from the top of your deck, shuffle it back into your
 *   deck", read from the discard pile (`activeIn: "discard"`). MC40 p. 21: as the deck's last card, the reset already
 *   shuffled it in. Its three icons are its `producesIcons`, which the deck-discard count reads as printed.
