 * - **Memories of Armageddon (40065)**: "Give to the Neena Thurman player" is engine data
 *   (`HeroIdentityCard.obligationCardId`). It stays in the player's play area. Both faces' text boxes are blank, traits
 *   kept (Q12 = A), so Domino's wild-counts-twice rule and both swap Actions are off until the Alter-Ego Action
 *   discards it.
 * - **Topaz (40066)**: finds Superpower Feedback in the encounter deck, its discard pile or the set-aside area (the
 *   nemesis set's own cards sit in its owner's set-aside area, so every player's is searched: Topaz may be dealt to
 *   another player) and attaches one copy to the revealing player's identity, then shuffles the encounter deck (RRG
 *   "Search", p. 39).
 * - **Not My Lucky Day (40067)**: each player chooses 1 damage or 2 threat here (neither is barred: RRG 1.8 p. 12, owner 2026-10-20 reversing Q8;
 *   an identity can always take damage and threat can always be placed).
 * - **Prototype (40068)**: luck counters equal to the revealing player's identity's damage, each +1 hit point.
 * - **Superpower Feedback (40069)**: attaches to the identity (data, `attachesTo`); the Forced Response taxes 1 damage per
 *   identity ability; the Alter-Ego Action discards an identity-specific card from hand to discard it.
