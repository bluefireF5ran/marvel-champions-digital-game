 * Domino's allies, supports and upgrades (40038, 40039, 40044-40049), docs/phase7-wave7.md §7.1, §3.55-§3.58, §3.61.
 *
 * Every "for each resource icon discarded this way" reads the slot of a `discardTopOfDeckCost`: the discard is a
 * cost (the "→" follows it, RRG "Cost", p. 14), so it is paid in full before the effect and a deck that cannot pay
 * leaves the ability unoffered. `totalPrintedResources` over the slot is where Domino's hero-face rule (a printed
 * wild counts twice, §3.56, MC40 p. 21) is applied.
 *
 * - **Diamondback (40038)**: exhaust, 1 damage to her and the discard are one cost; the damage to each enemy is not an
 *   attack. She resolves even when the cost defeats her (MC40 p. 21).
 * - **Outlaw (40039)**: Toughness is data. The Interrupt on her attack pays the discard and gives +1 ATK per icon until
 *   the attack ends. The star icon only marks the ability next to her ATK; the use is optional.
 * - **Pip the Pug (40044)**: a card of the Domino identity set, or any POSSE card, from the discard pile to the top
 *   of the deck.
 * - **The Painted Lady (40045)**: the Response is offered only while fewer than 3 cards are attached (a trigger
 *   `while`, so a full Painted Lady is not offered); the card, in the discard pile or in the reset deck, is attached
 *   facedown. A card another response already moved is not offered (§3.55). The alter-ego Action adds one attached
 *   card to hand.
 * - **Domino's Pistol (40046)**: Restricted is data. An attack labeled so Retaliate and Toughness apply; the damage is
 *   one per icon and the attack gains ranged.
 * - **Lucky and Good (40047)**: cancels the icons and the Boost ability of the boost card, then "another boost card
 *   for this attack" is one more card for the activation in progress (`extraBoostCards`, as Hydra Exo-Soldier
 *   04131), not a facedown boost card waiting for the next activation.
 * - **Lucky Break (40048)**: the Black Widow 01075 shape: the cost is discarding it, then the revealed card is
 *   cancelled and discarded and another is revealed. "When you reveal" is the revealing player's reveal.
 * - **Probability Field (40049)**: a plain Interrupt on the identity's basic power (alter-ego REC included).
