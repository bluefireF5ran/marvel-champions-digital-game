/**
 * The Nasty Boys modular set (40112-40117): five NASTY BOY minions and the Get Nasty side scheme. Teamwork (NASTY BOY)
 * on all five, and Hairbag's surge, Ramrod's retaliate and Slab's toughness, are card data (the built keywords; wave 6
 * decisions Q1 = RRG 1.8, Q2 = before When Revealed). A minion draws no boost card of its own (only the villain and
 * villainous minions do), so what is scripted here is each card's rules text and its Boost ability, resolved when the
 * card is turned faceup as a boost card for another enemy.
 *
 * "Exhaust a character you control" follows Bitter Rival (`trors` 04136): the player chooses any character they
 * control, one already exhausted included (the choice is not narrowed to a ready one).
