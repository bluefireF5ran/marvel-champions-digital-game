/**
 * The aspect and basic cards printed with Cable's precon (40014-40030), docs/phase7-wave7.md §7.1, §3.61.
 *
 * - **Caliban (40014)**, **Fantomex (40015)**: "After this enters play" responses (a put-into-play counts). Caliban
 *   discards from the deck until an ally of one of the three X-teams, then adds it (nothing found: nothing added).
 *   Fantomex searches the deck and discard pile for E.V.A. (may find none), puts it into play and shuffles.
 * - **Sunspot (40016)**: "After you play Sunspot from your hand": the chosen player; 1 damage (not an attack) to the
 *   villain and each minion engaged with them per [energy] used. A wild resource is generated as the type its player
 *   names, even when overpaying (ruling January 17, 2026, Ruling 4), so wilds spent count as energy.
 * - **Mission Planning (40017)**: play only if a side scheme is in the victory display (a constant, §7.1); Hero Action:
 *   until the end of the phase, your allies take no consequential damage.
 * - **Call for Backup, Establish Perimeter, Build Support (40018, 40020, 40027)**: Victory 0 is data; the starting
 *   threat per player is data. When Defeated resolves as the scheme leaves the limit (owner rulings,
 *   docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1); a scheme discarded by the limit, or never defeated, never resolves it.
 * - **Lock and Load (40019)**: its When Defeated finds a WEAPON upgrade costing 3 or less. Psimitar and Plasma Rifle
 *   go on the finder's identity; Sidearm ("attach to an ally") on an ally, and stays in the deck when no ally is in
 *   play. Restricted is checked as the upgrade enters play.
 * - **E.V.A. (40021)**: discarded when Fantomex is not in play, a standing condition (RRG 1.8 "Ability", p. 4, constant
 *   abilities), so an E.V.A. that enters play with no Fantomex is discarded immediately, before any interrupt or
 *   response to her entering play is offered (`stateCheckFromEntering`; owner ruling, docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1).
 *   Action, exhaust: remove 1 threat from a scheme (not a thwart), 1 damage to an enemy (not an attack), or heal 1
 *   from Fantomex.
 * - **Uncanny X-Force (40022)**: "Play under any player's control" and "Max 1 TEAM card per player" are data. While
 *   every character you control is X-FORCE (your identity included), each ally you control gets +1 THW, and takes 1
 *   less consequential damage after a thwart that thwarted a side scheme (player or encounter): the thwart reports its
 *   scheme (`thwartTarget`), read `anywhere` because a defeated side scheme has left play. A thwart divided across
 *   schemes counts when any of them is a side scheme.
 * - **Mission Leader (40023)**: costs 1 less while your identity has SOLDIER; after any side scheme is defeated, exhaust
 *   it: each player draws 1.
 * - **Deadpool (40024)**: replacement of a defeat by consequential damage: heal 3 from him instead, and an acceleration
 *   token goes on the main scheme. Damage that is not consequential defeats him as usual.
 * - **Deathlok (40025)**: Hero Response after he enters play: an upgrade costing 1 or less in any player's discard
 *   pile whose own "attach to" text allows him (`canAttachTo`: an "attach to an ally" upgrade, not an identity
 *   upgrade), attached to him. An upgrade another player owns is then controlled by Deathlok's controller (RRG 1.8
 *   "Ownership and Control", p. 31). With no such upgrade the response is not offered.
 * - **Frenemies (40026)**: Team-Up is data. Hero Action (thwart): 1 damage each to Cable and Deadpool, then 3 threat
 *   from a scheme and 3 from a different one, both thwarts by the identity.
 * - **The Power of the Mind (40028)**: its [mental] counts double while paying for a PSIONIC card.
 * - **Psimitar (40029)**: Restricted is data. After you play another PSIONIC card, exhaust: 2 damage to an enemy, an
 *   attack (so Guard, Retaliate and Toughness apply).
 * - **Sidearm (40030)**: a reprint of War Machine's Sidearm (`warm` 23035), the same definition object.
