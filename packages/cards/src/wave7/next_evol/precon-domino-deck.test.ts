 * threat) through `wave7Scenario` with the real registry; Juggernaut and Stryfe where the campaign's Hope Summers
 * (40130) must be in play. The deck is stacked so each discarded card is known: ENERGY 40052 (one energy icon), MENTAL
 * 40053, PHYSICAL 40055, WILD 40046 (one wild icon; Domino's hero face counts it twice), TRIO Jackpot! 40043 (three
 * produced icons). Hand cards pay costs; the hand is exactly the five PAYMENT cards unless a test says otherwise.
