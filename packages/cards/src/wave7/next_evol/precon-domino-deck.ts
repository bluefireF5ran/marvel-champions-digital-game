 *
 * - **Even the Odds (40052), Overwatch (40055)**: verbatim reprints of 30014 and 30019 (`wave5/spiderham`), aliased.
 *   Energy, Genius and Strength (40061-40063) print "Max 1 per deck." only: no ability refs.
 * - **Feral (40050)**: after she thwarts, discard the top card of her controller's deck; 1 damage (not an attack) to the
 *   villain per resource icon (a printed wild counts twice for Domino, §3.56).
 * - **Wolfsbane (40051)**: the type is named first (six types, player side scheme included), then the discard; a card a
 *   response already took away (Digging Deep) is no longer in the discard pile, so nothing is offered.
 * - **Team Investigation (40053)**: Alliance and `costPerPlayer` are data; plain removal of threat, not a thwart.
 * - **Take Out the Guards (40054), Superpower Training (40059)**: player side schemes, Victory 0 is data. When Defeated,
 *   each player (in player order) may act: discard a non-ELITE minion in play (a discard, not a defeat); search the deck
 *   and discard pile for an upgrade of their own identity set, attach it to their identity, then shuffle.
 * - **Atlas Bear (40056)**: any player's top card is looked at; an event may be added to its owner's hand for 1 damage
 *   to her.
 * - **White Fox (40057), Digging Deep (40060)**: responses from the discard pile after being discarded from the top of
 *   their owner's deck (`inDiscard`, §3.55).
 * - **The Posse (40058)**: "Play only if you control at least 3 POSSE characters" is its constant; the Action heals 1
 *   from, and readies, each POSSE character in play.
 * - **Sharpshooter (40064)**: Interrupt to your ranged attack; the cost discards the top card of the deck.
 * - **Hope Summers (40204)**: gains each trait of her controller's identity; after you play her, search for a SUPERPOWER
 *   card. She is not the campaign's Hope Summers 40130 (a different card with the same title).
