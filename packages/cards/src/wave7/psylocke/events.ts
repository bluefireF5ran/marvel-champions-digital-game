 * Psylocke's hero events and her pack's aspect and basic events (41004-41007, 41014, 41015, 41019, 41020),
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §7.2, §3.69.
 *
 * - **Flurry of Blades (41004), Hero Action (attack)**: the attack is the printed 2 damage; each Knife then confuses a
 *   chosen enemy and each Katana deals a chosen enemy 2 damage. The ability is one attack, so each Katana's 2 is
 *   damage from that attack and its enemy is attacked (docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 Q47): the engine makes a
 *   `dealDamage` to an enemy that follows an "(attack)" ability's `attack` that attack's, so the script is unchanged.
 * - **Mental Detection (41005), Hero Action (thwart)**: one thwart of 1 plus 2 per Knife ("additional" is part of the
 *   same thwart, RRG "Additional", p. 2); each Katana draws 1 card.
 * - **Psionic Redirect (41006), Hero Interrupt (defense)**: prevent 2, plus 2 per Katana; with a Knife, confuse the
 *   attacking enemy (a second Knife confuses an already confused enemy: no change).
 * - **Telepathic Suggestion (41007), Hero Interrupt**: cancel the revealed card's When Revealed, then per Katana 2
 *   damage to a chosen enemy and per Knife 1 threat off a chosen scheme.
 * - **Concussive Blow (41014)**: verbatim reprint of 05031, aliased.
 * - **Upside the Head (41015), Hero Response**: after her basic attack damages an enemy, stun it if it was confused,
 *   else confuse it (the status is read before it is given).
 * - **Directed Force (41019), Hero Interrupt**: 2 additional damage on her attack with overkill, piercing or ranged;
 *   one per attack across all copies (spec §3.69). Her Psi-Katana's piercing on a basic attack counts.
 * - **Soaring Hearts (41020), Hero Action**: Team-Up (Angel and Psylocke) is card data, so the engine refuses a play
 *   without both in play (Archangel is not "Angel", Q37). Identity-specific event from the discard pile to hand
 *   (optional pick, as Mutant Education), then ready Angel and Psylocke wherever they are.
