/**
 * Whole games with Psylocke's precon (`psylocke-justice`, cards 41001-41024) through the real engine and the real
 * wave 7 scripts, played by the card-name-agnostic greedy driver (`../../testing/driver.ts`) one command at a time, so
 * that every state is checked against the invariants below:
 *
 * - no engine error on a command the driver chose from legal candidates (`sessionApply` reports it);
 * - no prompt without an answer (RRG 1.8 "Choices" are never a soft lock): `minSelections` fits the options offered;
 * - the game never rests between steps with nothing pending outside a player turn (RRG Appendix II, "Villain Phase",
 *   pp. 51-52), and rounds advance by exactly one;
 * - the player side scheme limit is one for one or two starting players (RRG 1.8 "Player Side Scheme Limit", p. 34);
 * - no card instance sits in two zones; every card a player's deck started with is still somewhere; cards stay in
 *   their owner's zones (RRG 1.8 "Owner", "Controller", p. 31);
 * - no two unique cards under one table "match" (RRG 1.8 "Unique Icon", p. 45): Psylocke's identity never sits beside
 *   the Psylocke ally of Angel's deck, nor Angel's identity beside Psylocke's Angel ally;
 * - no player controls more restricted cards than the restricted limit while no prompt is open (RRG 1.8 "Restricted",
 *   p. 38; docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.2 Q38: a Psi-Katana shows the restricted keyword, a Psi-Knife does not);
 * - the first player token passes to the next seat at the end of each round (RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 20);
 * - the session log replays to the identical final state (the engine's determinism contract).
 *
 * Deviations from the driver, both about policy and not about the rules: Hope Summers is never declared a defender
 * (Stryfe: "If Hope Summers is defeated, you lose"; nor is a Morlock in Morlock Siege, whose main scheme loses the
 * game when no Morlock ally is in play), and a turn is ended after 40 commands (the driver's own per-turn cap resets
 * because it is asked for one command at a time).
 *
 * Targeted checks (the `seen` tally; the last test asserts each was seen at least once, naturally or in a staged
 * state, as the test says): the Setup blades, Psi-Energy Control flips (the value follows the new face), a blade's
 * resource as its showing face's type, Betsy Braddock's shuffle, the events' scaling with Knives and Katanas, Body
 * Swapped, the nemesis cards, Lay the Trap.
