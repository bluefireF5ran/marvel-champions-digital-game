/**
 * Psylocke's permanent blades, allies, supports, upgrades, side scheme and resource (41002-41024), docs/phase7-wave7.md
 * §7.2, §3.64.
 *
 * - **Psi-Knife (41002a) / Psi-Katana (41002b)**: Permanent is data. Each face's constant and Hero Resource are its own
 *   ref. The Knife is +1 THW and [mental]; the Katana +1 ATK, piercing on her basic attacks (`basicOnly`: an event's
 *   attack does not gain it), and [physical]. "You may flip this card" is part of the resource's effects, a choice the
 *   player may decline; a flip Body Swapped forbids is not offered (`cannotFlip`). The restricted limit after a flip to
 *   the Katana is the engine's (Q38 = A).
 * - **Angel (41003)**: ready the identity after he is played.
 * - **Training Regimen (41008)**: search is optional (a deck may hold no SKILL card); the hand discard is read after the
 *   search, in hero form only.
 * - **Martial Arts / Psionic / Weapons Training (41009-41011)**: a constant and a response whose cost discards the card.
 *   Each response is her own ("Psylocke defends / thwarts / attacks", not an ally).
 * - **Captain Britain (41012)**: two scoped -1 rules on his consequential damage, one per power: after a thwart that
 *   thwarted a side scheme (the scheme has left play if defeated, so read `anywhere`), after an attack on a minion.
 * - **Cypher (41013)**: the target is read as the attack ends; a confused enemy the attack defeats counts (its status
 *   is part of the attack's result).
 * - **Pete Wisdom (41018)**: after the player resolves a treachery (an obligation is not one). X-FORCE is data.
 * - **IPAC (41022)**: printed as a cost, "deal 1 facedown encounter card to a player" is built as the first effects (the
 *   cost only deals to the payer): the card stays facedown until the villain phase, so nothing else is read in between.
 * - **X-Bunker (41023)**: the chosen player is one whose identity has MUTANT; they search the top X cards, X the side
 *   schemes (player and encounter) in the victory display.
 * - **Float Like a Butterfly (41017)**: "Play under any player's control", Max 1 per player are data.
 * - **Lay the Trap (41016)**: Victory 0 is data; the damage is the defeating player's.
 * - **The Power of the Mind (41021)**: the reprint of 40028, the same definition.
