 * X-23 events (43004-43007) and the pack's other events (43016, 43017, 43038, 43040): docs/phase7-wave7.md §7.3.
 *
 * - **Animal Instinct (43004)**: Hero Interrupt to her basic thwart; +X THW for this thwart, X her ATK (read as the
 *   bonus is added, so it includes ATK modifiers already in play). The card prints THW, so the bonus is to THW even
 *   when the thwart is made with ATK.
 * - **Claw Mastery (43005)**: Max 1 per round is data. +2 ATK until the end of the round, and a lasting rule that her
 *   attacks gain overkill while Honey Badger is in play (the condition is read at each attack, not when the event is
 *   played).
 * - **Regenerative Longevity (43006)**: a plain Action (the data prints "Action:", so alter-ego Laura Kinney can play it): the divided heal over her identity and Honey Badger.
 * - **Sisterly Bond (43007)**: Hero Interrupt to your Honey Badger's basic thwart or basic attack ("thwarts or attacks"
 *   read as her basic powers, an agent call); her power gets X-23's matching one, read live, for that use. "Matching"
 *   is the stat powering Honey Badger's power (docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 Q54 = B): a thwart made with ATK (a scheme
 *   with assault, RRG 1.8 p. 8) adds X-23's ATK.
 * - **Critical Hit (43016), Predictable Ploy (43038), Anticipated Attack (43040)**: the play restriction is the
 *   `*-constant` ref; the Hero Interrupt or Response is the other. Anticipated Attack's text has no "against you":
 *   any enemy's attack lets her give her hero a tough status card.
 * - **Moment of Triumph (43017)**: a verbatim reprint of 12030, aliased.
