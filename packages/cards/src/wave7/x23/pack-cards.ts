 * The x23 pack's player side schemes (43018, 43021, 43039), the four linked Specialists (43034-43037) and the basic
 * resource reprints (43022-43024), docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.75.
 *
 * - **Keep Them Busy (43018)**: Victory 0 and Assault are data; the When Defeated is "the player who defeated this
 *   scheme" (`defeatingPlayer`) removing 5 per hero threat from the main scheme.
 * - **Specialized Training (43021)**: each player in player order who controls no SPECIALIZATION upgrade chooses one
 *   set-aside SPECIALIZATION upgrade (the Specialists, set aside ownerless at setup, RRG "Linked (Card Title)", p. 27)
 *   and puts it into play under their control. A unique Specialist that matches one already in play cannot be put
 *   into play (RRG 1.8 "Unique Icon", pp. 45–46), so it is not among the choices (`canEnterPlay`).
 * - **Rally the Troops (43039)**: heal 2 from each ally, every player's.
 * - **The Specialists**: "Your hero gets +1 X" is a constant on your hero (hero form only); the Hero Response is
 *   "After your hero performs a basic X". Front Line Specialist is erratad (RRG 1.8 p. 69): "Your identity gets +4
 *   hit points", and its Response (not a Hero Response) follows damage to the identity from an enemy attack.
 * - **Energy, Genius, Strength (43022-43024)**: print "Max 1 per deck." only (data), no ability refs.
