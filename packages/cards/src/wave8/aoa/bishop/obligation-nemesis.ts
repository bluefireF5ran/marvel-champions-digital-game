 * Bishop's obligation and nemesis set (docs/phase7-wave8.md section 7.1, 3.52, 3.1, 3.60).
 *
 * Cards (5):
 * - 45025 Fear the Future (obligation)
 * - 45026 Trevor Fitzroy (minion)
 * - 45027 Portal Through Time (side_scheme)
 * - 45028 Bantam (minion)
 * - 45029 Temporal Trickery (treachery)
 *
 * **Fear the Future (45025)**: Core's shared `obligation()` shape ("Give to the Lucas Bishop player" is engine data). The
 * second option discards each resource card in hand and then the obligation; with none in hand (read before the
 * discard) the card gains surge, the same shape as Burn Notice.
 *
 * **Trevor Fitzroy (45026)**: Quickstrike is data. Forced Response after he attacks and defeats an ally: 2 threat on
 * Portal Through Time if it is in play, otherwise find it and reveal it (the engaged player reveals).
 *
 * **Bantam (45028)**: the same choice as a When Revealed.
 *
 * **Temporal Trickery (45029)**: the player discards a card in hand with the most printed resource icons (the hand is
 * bound as a slot, `superlative` keeps every tied card), then each scheme in play (main and side) takes 1 threat per
 * printed icon on it. An empty hand does nothing. A tie is the first player's to break (RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 19),
 * picking among the tied cards facedown when the hand is not theirs (p. 42, "Table Talk"; owner answer 211,
 * docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md §4.1): `firstPlayerPicksFromHand`.
 *
 * **Portal Through Time (45027)**, "Forced Interrupt: When a TEMPORAL card is revealed, it gains surge. (Limit once per
 * phase.)": a forced interrupt of the side scheme in play on the card being revealed, giving that card surge
 * (`surge(eventTarget)`), limited by its own uses. A TEMPORAL card revealed before the Portal entered play that phase
 * (Bantam, which finds it) used nothing, so the next TEMPORAL card revealed that phase gains surge.
