/**
 * Whole games with Bishop's precon (`bishop-leadership`, MC45 p. 22: 40 cards) through the real engine and the real
 * wave 8 scripts, played by the card-name-agnostic greedy driver (`../../../testing/driver.ts`) one command at a time,
 * so every state is checked against the invariants below. Scenarios: Unus the Untouched (the wave's own first
 * scenario, `wave8Scenario("unus")`, standard, one player) and Core's Rhino (standard, no modular set, built by
 * `coreScenario` with Bishop's seat swapped in). Unus is swingy for a one-player precon: the seeded games here are lost
 * in rounds 3 to 6 (Hunting Gene Traitors and Dystopian Nightmare), which is still long enough to see Energy Absorption
 * fire 3 to 4 times per game, so the Unus games assert mechanics, never the outcome. Rhino gives the longer games.
 *
 * Invariants checked after every command:
 * - no engine error on a command the driver chose from legal candidates (`sessionApply` reports it);
 * - no prompt without an answer (RRG 1.8 "Choices" never a soft lock): `minSelections` fits the options offered;
 * - the game never rests between steps with nothing pending outside a player turn (RRG Appendix II, pp. 51-52);
 * - no card instance sits in two zones; every card the deck started with is still somewhere (RRG "Owner", p. 31);
 * - hands refill at the end of the player turn, up to the hand size of the form showing (RRG "Hand Size", Appendix II
 *   "Player Phase" step, p. 51);
 * - the alter-ego Bishop is never offered as a defender, a hero form identity only (RRG "Defend", p. 14: only a hero
 *   or an ally can defend; an alter-ego identity is neither);
 * - the session log replays to the identical final state (the engine's determinism contract).
 *
 * Targeted checks (the `seen` tally; the last test asserts each was seen at least once, naturally or in a staged
 * state, as the test says):
 * - Energy Absorption (45001a, MC45 p. 22 and the card): after he takes damage from an attack, that many cards leave the
 *   top of his deck for his discard pile, each resource card among them goes to his hand, and the moment
 *   "energyAbsorption" is raised once; never offered when the attack was fully stopped (`taken` 0) or in alter-ego form.
 * - Temporally Displaced (45001b): after he changes to the alter-ego form, one TEMPORAL card of his discard pile goes
 *   to his hand (none when there is none).
 * - Energy Conversion (45009): a resource card of his discard pile is shuffled into his deck, and he takes at most 3
 *   damage from that attack.
 *
 * Portal Through Time (45027) is registered (its Forced Interrupt gives surge to the first TEMPORAL card revealed each
 * phase while it is in play); the only path to it is Bantam or Trevor Fitzroy finding it. Not asserted here: its own
 * module's tests stage it.
