/**
 * Campaign-only encounter set `age_of_apocalypse` (campaign mode only; docs/phase7-wave8.md §1.28, §3.33, §3.41).
 *
 * Both cards refer to the mission by name, so their queries reach into the closed mission area
 * (`inScenarioPlayArea`, through `mission-rules.ts`). Each first option needs a [MISSION] side scheme in play: with
 * the mission finished, or in a game with no mission, only the second can be chosen (§3.41).
 *
 * Agent of Apocalypse (45164): a revealed minion engages the player as any does (RRG 1.8 "Reveal", p. 38), then its
 *   When Revealed resolves. "Add … to the mission area" moves it there from play: not engaged, under no player's
 *   control, and it never activates (RRG 1.8 "Activation", p. 6). Guard is data and reads minions engaged with a player
 *   (RRG p. 21), so it does nothing at the mission. "Or it activates against you" is an ordinary activation.
 *   The Boost's "an ally at the mission" is chosen by the player resolving the boost ("you": the player the
 *   activation is against); with none there, nothing is dealt. "Give the activating enemy an additional boost card"
 *   is its own sentence and happens either way.
 * Worldwide Crisis (45165): "take 1 damage" is the player's identity.
 *
 * Cards (2):
 * - 45164 Agent of Apocalypse (minion)
 * - 45165 Worldwide Crisis (treachery)
