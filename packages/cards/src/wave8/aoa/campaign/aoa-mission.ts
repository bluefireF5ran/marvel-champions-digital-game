/**
 * Campaign-only encounter set `aoa_mission` (campaign mode only; docs/phase7-wave8.md §1.24, §2.13, §3.37, §3.39,
 * §3.40, §4.1 Q18 to Q20). The five missions, a face (the [MISSION] side scheme) and b face (the [FINISHED] side).
 *
 * **The a face**, the same two lines on all five.
 *
 * "Forced Response: After you resolve a mission attempt, place 1 attempt counter here and deal 1 damage to each ally
 *   at the mission. If there are 4 attempt counters here, remove Mission Team from the game and flip this card over."
 *   It answers the moment Mission Team's attempt raises (`MISSION_ATTEMPT`), whoever made the attempt: a mission has
 *   no controller. An attempt that defeated the mission in its step 5 finds this face gone and places no counter.
 *   Removing Mission Team from the game is not a discard (§3.35).
 *
 * "When Defeated: Shuffle each player card at the mission into its owner's deck. Flip Mission Team and this card
 *   over." The upgrades first, then the allies, so an upgrade is shuffled into its deck and not discarded as its host
 *   leaves play (RRG 1.8 "Attachment", p. 8). Before it flips, the card takes one `defeated` counter: the [FINISHED]
 *   face is reached for one of two reasons and reads the counter to know which (§3.40: a flip between two side schemes
 *   keeps the card's tokens, RRG 1.8 "Flip", p. 20). The flip keeps the card in the mission area.
 *
 * **The b face**: "Forced Response: After you flip to this side, remove each card in the mission area from the game
 * and do the following:" then one bullet for a mission that was not defeated and one for a mission that was. Cards
 * attached to a card there go first (the facedown cards on Abyss are removed with him, §2.13), then every other card
 * there. The [FINISHED] face is itself a card in the mission area: it goes last, once its bullet has resolved (§4.1
 * Q20 = A). "You" is the player whose effect flipped the card, else the first player.
 *
 * Each player's part of a bullet resolves in player order (RRG 1.8 "Each Player", p. 17). A search finds a card when
 * one is there (RRG 1.8 "Search", p. 39) and the deck is shuffled after.
 *
 * What the campaign must have set aside for the bullets: the four copies of Desperate Measures (45176) for Liberate
 * the Seattle Core, and the campaign allies (45172 to 45175) for Find Lost Mutants. North American Sea Wall (45177) is
 * found wherever it is.
 *
 * Cards (10):
 * - 45166a Liberate the Seattle Core (side_scheme)
 * - 45166b Liberate the Seattle Core (side_scheme)
 * - 45167a Evacuate Survivors (side_scheme)
 * - 45167b Evacuate Survivors (side_scheme)
 * - 45168a Sabotage the Sea Wall (side_scheme)
 * - 45168b Sabotage the Sea Wall (side_scheme)
 * - 45169a Find Lost Mutants (side_scheme)
 * - 45169b Find Lost Mutants (side_scheme)
 * - 45170a Protect the Professor (side_scheme)
 * - 45170b Protect the Professor (side_scheme)
