 *    resets and "no further cards are discarded from the newly shuffled deck" (RRG 1.8 "Player Deck", p. 33). Each

 *    a discarded card's own Response. A card a response took away is no longer in the slot (ruling April 30, 2026 –
 *    Ruling 4 (1): "it does not count for the mission attempt and no replacement card is drawn").
 * 2. "Assign each of the discarded cards to a different ally at the mission." An ally whose card shares a resource icon
 *    with it participates, a [wild] on either side matching anything. The cards stay in the discard pile.
 * 3. and 4. A pool of the participants' total ATK, dealt to the enemies at the mission one at a time, each settled
 *    before the next; what nobody can take is lost. Not an attack.
 * 5. "Remove X threat from the [MISSION] side scheme, where X is the total THW of all participating allies." Not a
 *    thwart (RRG 1.8 "Thwart", p. 44): nothing exhausts and no ally takes consequential damage.
 *
 * Then the moment the mission's own Forced Response answers. It is raised whatever the steps did: an attempt with no
 * ally at the mission discards nothing and still counts. A mission step 5 defeated has flipped by then, so nothing
 * answers.
