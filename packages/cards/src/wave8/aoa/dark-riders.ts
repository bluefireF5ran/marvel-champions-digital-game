/**
 * Modular encounter set `dark_riders` (Age of Apocalypse, docs/phase7-wave8.md §2.10, §3.32, §8.4): five unique Dark
 * Riders minions and The Dark Riders side scheme. Teamwork (Dark Riders) and Hinder 1 per hero are data keywords
 * (wave 6 §3.1; Tusk prints SCH 0). Every Forced Response answers an attack against "you", the player the minion is
 * engaged with. The scheme's toughness is a keyword grant read while it is in play, so a minion that enters later gets
 * the tough status card too; its When Revealed is the same discard-until-and-reveal as Mutant Terrorists.
 *
 * Cards (6):
 * - 45112 Gauntlet (minion)
 * - 45113 Barrage (minion)
 * - 45114 Hard-Drive (minion)
 * - 45115 Tusk (minion)
 * - 45116 Psynapse (minion)
 * - 45117 The Dark Riders (side_scheme)
