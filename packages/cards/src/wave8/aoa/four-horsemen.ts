/**
 * Scenario set `four_horsemen` (Age of Apocalypse, docs/phase7-wave8.md §2.3, §3.7 to §3.15): the four Horsemen
 * villains (side A and side B are separate one-stage cards with the same text), the main scheme, four side schemes,
 * two attachments and five treacheries.
 *
 * Every ref the card data names is registered (`FOUR_HORSEMEN_SKIPPED` is empty): the eight villain faces (a Forced
 * Response and the "cannot be defeated" constant each), the main scheme's 1A Setup and 1B Forced Response, the four
 * side schemes' When Defeated, Golden Horse and Metal Wings (the considered hit points floor, the trait or retaliate,
 * the Hero Response; Metal Wings' When Revealed), the four Horseman treacheries (When Revealed and Boost) and Rough
 * Riders.
 *
 * The row (docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.7, §3.8). 1A's Setup shuffles the four set-aside Horsemen into a row
 * (`addVillain` with `row: "shuffled"`: `GameState.villainRow`, logged `villainRowSet`) and the leftmost takes the
 * active counter; then each player, in player order, reveals a random side scheme of the set from the encounter deck,
 * which is shuffled once afterward (RRG 1.8 "Search", p. 39). 1B hears every villain activation, the villain phase's
 * and one a treachery or boost ability starts, and moves the counter one place along the row from the villain that
 * holds it, whichever villain activated (§4.1 Q5 = A, the owner's decision). A stunned or confused villain did not
 * activate (RRG 1.8 "Stun, Stunned", p. 41; "Confused", p. 13), so the counter stays (§4.1 Q4 = A).
 *
 * "Another villain has at least 1 hit point" is read live from the other three Horsemen by title (`named`: a villain
 * not in play reads 0). It reads `remainingHp`, and so does each Forced Response's "if he has at least 1 hit point".
 *
 * "Is considered to have at least 1 hit point" (Golden Horse, Metal Wings; docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.10, §4.1 Q6 = A) is
 * `consideredToHaveHitPoints` on the attached villain: every reading of its remaining hit points is at least 1, so its
 * own Forced Response still resolves at 0, the other three Horsemen stay protected by it, and it is not defeated at
 * zero itself (RRG 1.8 "Defeat", p. 15) until the attachment leaves. The dial is untouched, so Golden Horse's own
 * "villain with the fewest hit points" reads the real one.
 *
 * Horseman of War / Famine / Pestilence / Death: the When Revealed heals 2, gives a tough status card and starts the
 * activation (`enemyActivates`, against the player who revealed it). The Boost queues the second activation behind
 * the one it was drawn for, with no boost card (`afterCurrentActivation`, `noBoost`; Hellfire 49042 is the same
 * shape). The active counter is not touched here: it is 1B's job (45085b) and, per Q5 = A, moves one position from the
 * villain that holds it.
 *
 * Cards (20):
 * - 45081a War (villain)
 * - 45081b War (villain)
 * - 45082a Famine (villain)
 * - 45082b Famine (villain)
 * - 45083a Pestilence (villain)
 * - 45083b Pestilence (villain)
 * - 45084a Death (villain)
 * - 45084b Death (villain)
 * - 45085a The Horsemen of Apocalypse (main_scheme)
 * - 45086 The Ravages of War (side_scheme)
 * - 45087 A Time of Famine (side_scheme)
 * - 45088 Plague and Pestilence (side_scheme)
 * - 45089 The Specter of Death (side_scheme)
 * - 45090 Golden Horse (attachment)
 * - 45091 Metal Wings (attachment)
 * - 45092 Horseman of War (treachery)
 * - 45093 Horseman of Famine (treachery)
 * - 45094 Horseman of Pestilence (treachery)
 * - 45095 Horseman of Death (treachery)
