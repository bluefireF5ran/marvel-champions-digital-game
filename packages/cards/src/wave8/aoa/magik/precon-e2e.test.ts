/**
 * Whole games with Magik's precon (`magik-aggression`, MC45 box rulebook: 40 cards) through the real engine and the real
 * wave 8 scripts, played by the card-name-agnostic greedy driver (`../../../testing/driver.ts`) one command at a time,
 * so every state is checked against the invariants below. Scenarios: Unus the Untouched (`wave8Scenario("unus")`,
 * standard, one player), Core's Rhino (standard, no modular set, built by `coreScenario` with Magik's seat swapped in),
 * and a few two-player rounds of Rhino with Spider-Man's Core deck. The driver never plays from the top of the deck, so
 * `nextCommand` below tries that first (the permission it needs is `deckTopPlayableBy`, the engine's own query) and
 * hands every other decision to the driver; the shared driver is untouched.
 *
 * Invariants checked after every command:
 * - no engine error on a command chosen from legal candidates (`sessionApply` reports it);
 * - no prompt without an answer (RRG 1.8 "Choices"): `minSelections` fits the options offered;
 * - the game never rests between steps with nothing pending outside a player turn (RRG Appendix II, pp. 51-52);
 * - no card instance sits in two zones; every card a deck started with is still somewhere (RRG "Owner", p. 31);
 * - the top card of her deck is shown (`shownDeckTop`) exactly while she is in hero form and the deck has a card
 *   (45030a "Play with the top card of your deck faceup"; docs/phase7-wave8.md section 3.48, Q26 = B);
 * - Crown, Soulsword and Mystical Armor (45033 to 45035): her THW / ATK / DEF equal the printed value plus 1 for each
 *   attached upgrade whose icon (mental / physical / energy, or wild) shows on the top card, hero form only (card text);
 * - the session log replays to the identical final state (the engine's determinism contract).
 *
 * Targeted checks (the `seen` tally; the last test asserts each was seen at least once, naturally or staged, as the
 * test says):
 * - 45030a play from the deck top (RRG 1.8 FAQ "Magik (#30A)", p. 64): `cardPlayed { from: "deckTop", countsAsFrom:
 *   "hand" }`, in hero form, once per phase, the card was the top card, it is not in the hand at any point, the cost
 *   paid is at least the printed cost less 1;
 * - Limbo (45032): the hand card and the top card swap places (RRG "Swap", p. 42), neither drawn nor discarded;
 * - Scrying (45036), Stepping Disc (45037): the top 3 / the discard pile move as printed;
 * - Exorcism (45038) and Soul Strike (45039) read the live top card when they resolve; Soul Strike is one attack
 *   (owner ruling Q48); Magic Barrier (45040) prevents 3 and hits back for 3 on an energy / wild top card;
 * - Belasco (45054) is villainous and draws a boost card each activation (RRG "Boost Icon / Boost Cards", p. 6, and the
 *   Villainous keyword); his forced response mills 3; Ruler of Limbo (45055) attaches Limbo facedown when revealed;
 * - hazard deals one extra card per icon in player order (RRG "Hazard Icon", p. 21); ready and draw happen at the end of
 *   the player phase (RRG Appendix II "Player Phase", p. 51).
 *
 * Illyana Rasputin's interrupt 45030b (the window before the form change) and Colossus 45031 (his in-hand interrupt,
 * offered only when affordable) are registered; the last section stages each.
