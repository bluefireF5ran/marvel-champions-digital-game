/**
 * Standard III (Age of Apocalypse, docs/phase7-wave8.md §2.5, §3.6, §4.1 Q2, Q3), an alternative to the Standard set.
 *
 * Pursued by the Past counts pursuit counters. "You" is the player whose card placed the counter (the one revealing
 * the treachery, the one a boost card's activation is against, the one whose turn began for Drawing Near). A counter a
 * treachery's When Revealed places is placed there and then, but the Forced Response to it waits until the reveal has
 * finished (RRG v1.8 p.38; owner decision 2026-10-16 (audit finding 18), reversing Q2 = A), so the treachery's "Then,
 * if it has any counters" finds the counter and the reset follows the reveal. "The number of players" is the players in the game now (Q3 = A).
 * Placing several counters at once is one placement and one check. The "remove each counter" arrow is read as the
 * first effect: it is always payable, since the Forced Response only runs with at least 3 more counters than players.
 *
 * Side B (45075b) answers the flip to it. The flip names the player whose effect flipped the card (`cardFlipped.playerId`),
 * and side A's Forced Response resolves as the player who placed the counter, so side B's "you" is that same player:
 * their nemesis minion, their nemesis side scheme, their set. Environments flip, they are not revealed (ruling June 25,
 * 2026 – Ruling 4 (3)), so neither flip is a reveal.
 *
 * Cards (6):
 * - 45075a Pursued by the Past (environment)
 * - 45076 Dark Designs (treachery)
 * - 45077 Sinister Strike (treachery)
 * - 45078 Evil Alliance (treachery)
 * - 45079 Nowhere is Safe (treachery)
 * - 45080 Drawing Near (obligation)
