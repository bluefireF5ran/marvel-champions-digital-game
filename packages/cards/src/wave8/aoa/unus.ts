 * Scenario set `unus` (Age of Apocalypse, docs/phase7-wave8.md §2.2, §3.2 to §3.5, §3.12, §3.14), the Unus villain
 * (stages I to III share one text) and Hunting Gene Traitors. Every card is existing vocabulary.
 *
 * Unus reads Gene Pool's threat live, so each cumulative tier (retaliate 1 at 3, stalwart at 6, an amplify icon
 *   at 9) turns off when threat leaves Gene Pool.
 * Hunting Gene Traitors 1A setup: Gene Pool is already in play from its own setup keyword (§2.2 step 5), so
 *   "reveal" changes nothing; only the expert-mode facedown deal is scripted.
 * Infinite Prelate (§4.1 Q8 = A): the additional boost card is part of the activation, so it is the activation's
 *   own `extraBoostCards`; the tough card and the heal follow the activation, each tier read live when it resolves.
 *
 * Cards (8):
 * - 45059 Unus (villain)
 * - 45062a Hunting Gene Traitors (main_scheme)
 * - 45063 Prelate Sidearm (attachment)
 * - 45064 Prelate Armor (attachment)
 * - 45065 Infinite Hunter (minion)
 * - 45066 Genetic Experiments (attachment)
 * - 45067 Infinite Prelate (treachery)
 * - 45068 Endless Ranks (side_scheme)
