/**
 * Wave 8 definition-of-done 4b, "A real MarvelCDB decklist per new hero" (docs/wave-definition-of-done.md,
 * docs/custom-deck-testing.md "The pieces"): one real public MarvelCDB decklist per new hero, imported with the existing
 * importer, legal under `validateDeck`, and played by the seeded greedy driver through the wave 8 scenario builder with a
 * deep-equal replay.
 *
 * Fixtures: `fixtures/decklists/<hero>.json`, each FETCHED (not composed) on 2026-10-08 from
 * `GET https://marvelcdb.com/api/public/decklist/<id>.json` (re-serialized with two-space indent; the only field changed
 * is `description_md`: emptied at first, restored on 2026-10-10 because the Decks screen shows it as the author's notes,
 * and still empty for Magik's 37117, whose write-up would put the file past the importer's 20,000-character cap).
 * Each is the first (most-liked) public decklist in that list for its hero, and each imports in full against the
 * playable pool with every card scripted (no decklist had to be skipped). The decks draw on earlier packs too (Core and
 * waves 1 to 7), which is why the game below widens the card pool.
 *
 * | Hero         | Decklist                                                          | Aspect     |
 * | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
 * | Bishop       | 37204 "Resource Tutor" (marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/37204)        | Justice    |
 * | Magik        | 37117 "Devil May Scry!" (.../view/37117)                          | Protection |
 * | Iceman       | 38626 "Iceman - Ice To Meet You All" (.../view/38626)             | Leadership |
 * | Jubilee      | 40621 "Rush Hour" (.../view/40621)                                | Justice    |
 * | Nightcrawler | 42268 "No Allies No Problem" (.../view/42268)                     | Protection |
 * | Magneto      | 43978 "Magneto Was Right [GMW Expert Campaign]" (.../view/43978)  | Justice    |
 *
 * The game is built with `wave8Scenario` and the game's card pool widened to `PLAYABLE_CARDS` (the wave 8 pool is Core
 * plus the five wave 8 packs only; a public decklist draws on every earlier pack), as `rulings.qa.test.ts` does.
 *
 * Finding (fixed in the importer, pinned below): MarvelCDB decklists never list Iceman's six set-aside Frostbite (46002; the card sits in the
 * separate `iceman_frostbite` card set, `hero_special`, quantity 6), so a real Iceman decklist imports and then fails
 * `validateDeck` with `identity_set_mismatch` (RRG 1.8 Appendix I "Deck Customization", p. 50: "the exact quantity of
 * each card included in that identity set must be included"). Compare Psylocke's Psi-Knife (41002a), which MarvelCDB does
 * list. The importer therefore adds any identity-set card entirely absent from the slots, at its set quantity, with an
 * `identity_set_filled` note.
