/**
 * QA: the community Doctor Strange 'Pool deck, MarvelCDB decklist 34506 "Invoke the Fourth Wall, Break the Game"
 * (fixture `fixtures/decklists/doctor-strange-invoke-the-fourth-wall.json`, saved unmodified), brief in
 * docs/custom-deck-testing.md "Waiting on packs".
 *
 * The author's strategy, line by line (each is one `describe`):
 *  1. resolve a couple of Invocations, then Mulligan (44048) to draw a new hand;
 *  2. Get Rage-y (44020) readies Wong (09002) to reach the right Invocation;
 *  3. Stick-To-Itiveness (44030) readies the hero for another Invocation;
 *  4. Machine Man (26022) spends spare resources for a good activation.
 * Then the loop question: do the readies chain without limit inside one turn?
 *
 * Sources, kept apart:
 *  - OFFICIAL, RRG 1.8: "Play, Put into Play" p. 32 (a card is played from hand, paying its cost; "A card that is put
 *    into play is not considered to have been played"), "Ready" p. 36 (an exhausted card returns to the ready state),
 *    "Resolve" p. 37 (an event is resolved when it is played; other card types are never "resolved", but their
 *    abilities can be), "Limit X per [period]" (per-instance limits). RRG 1.8 has no general infinite-loop rule
 *    (checked 2026-10-01, docs/custom-deck-testing.md), and docs/rulings/marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md has none either.
 *  - PRINTED TEXT: quoted beside each test from the card data.
 *  - OUR INTERPRETATION: marked "Interpretation:" where the RRG does not say outright (e.g. that resolving an
 *    Invocation's Special through Spell Mastery is not "playing" a card for Mulligan's restriction).
 * Staging (a card put in play, spare Strength cards conjured to pay with) is state surgery for setup only.
