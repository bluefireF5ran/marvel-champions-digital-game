 * Iceman pack aspect and basic player cards, docs/phase7-wave8.md section 7.2, 3.67, 3.68, 3.70.
 *
 * Cards (12):
 * - 46012 Shark-Girl (ally)
 * - 46013 Glob (ally)
 * - 46014 Suppressing Fire (upgrade)
 * - 46015 Surprise Move (event)
 * - 46016 Take That! (event)
 * - 46017 Looking for Trouble (event)
 * - 46018 Keep Up the Pressure (player_side_scheme)
 * - 46019 Shadowcat (ally)
 * - 46020 Beak (ally)
 * - 46021 Team-Building Exercise (support)
 * - 46022 Recuperation (event)
 * - 46023 The Power in All of Us (resource)
 *
 * **Reprints, one script under two ids**: Looking for Trouble 46017 is `gmw` 16043's, Team-Building Exercise 46021 is
 * `ant` 12024's, Recuperation 46022 is `scw` 15031's and The Power in All of Us 46023 is 13024's.
 *
 * **Keep Up the Pressure (46018)**: When Defeated, each player may take an ATTACK event from their deck or discard pile
 * (the deck is shuffled either way), then until the end of the phase each ATTACK event deals 1 additional damage
 * (`modifyCardEffectsUntil`): every instance of damage an event with the ATTACK trait deals while it lasts, whoever
 * plays it (owner ruling Q53; RRG 1.8 "Attack (Player Ability Type)", p. 10, and "Event", p. 19), never an instance
 * that is itself additional damage and never damage its own player takes.
 *
 * **Shark-Girl (46012)**: a constant on herself, live only while an attack of hers against an enemy is in progress, whose
 * amount counts the upgrades attached to the enemy that attack is against (`attackedBy()`, read off the attack on the
 * stack). An upgrade attached during the attack before its damage is dealt counts.
 *
 * **Glob (46013)**: the target is part of the Response, so with no enemy that has an upgrade attached he answers
 * nothing. "Play only if your identity has the X-Men trait" is card data (`playRestrictions`).
 *
 * **Suppressing Fire (46014)**: "you" is the hero, so an ally's attack that defeats the minion does not count (as
 * Change of Fortune, `ncrawler` 48014). It is an Interrupt to the defeat, so the heal resolves while the minion and the
 * upgrade are still in play.
 *
 * **Surprise Move (46015)**: the target is checked when the card is played, so an upgrade attached by an earlier
 * Interrupt to the same attack (Iceman's "Freeze!") counts: the interrupt window offers Surprise Move once "Freeze!"
 * has resolved (the engine's `heardAtOpen`). "If this attack defeats that enemy" is read when the attack ends.
 *
 * **Take That! (46016)** is an "(attack)" ability that only deals damage: the engine makes it one attack by the
 * identity (Q48 = A), so its damage is attack damage, guard limits the choice (Q49) and retaliate and "after you
 * attack" answer it.
 *
 * **Shadowcat (46019)**: the chosen side scheme loses each of the four icons until the end of the round, as a lasting
 * rule (docs/phase7-wave6.md section 3.38).
