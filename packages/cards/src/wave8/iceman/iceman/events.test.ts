 * 3.61, 3.67; Q35 = A, Q38 = A. Real commands in a real game: his starter deck (`iceman-aggression`) against Rhino.
 * Hero face: THW 1, ATK 2, DEF 2, 11 hit points. Rhino (stage 1): ATK 2, SCH 1, 14 hit points per hero. Sandman
 * (01102, relabeled from an encounter card): ATK 3, SCH 2, 4 hit points; Mercenary (01101): 3 hit points.
 *
 * Frostbite's Forced Response ships as its activation half (the supports module pins the leaves-play gap, section 3.61).
 * A defeated Frostbitten enemy leaves its copy unattached in the
 * play area rather than set aside, so no test asserts where that copy ends up, and none reads "Frostbite attached" after
 * a defeating attack. A copy that was never attached (the host was defeated before the attach step) stays set aside.
