 *
 * Cards (3):
 * - 46009 Arctic Attack (event)
 * - 46010 Ice Blast (event)
 * - 46011 Chill Out! (event)
 *
 * **Arctic Attack (46009)**, Hero Action (attack): choose one. Either deal 4 damage to an enemy and then attach a
 * set-aside copy of Frostbite to it, or deal 6 damage to an enemy with Frostbite attached. It carries the "(attack)"
 * label, so each option is an attack by his identity (RRG 1.8 "Attack", p. 7: guard and retaliate apply; he does not
 * exhaust), made on an enemy he may attack. The first option attaches after the damage: an enemy the attack defeats
 * has nothing to receive the copy, and the copy stays set aside. Its second option is offered only while an enemy he
 * may attack has a copy attached, read when the choice is made (before the damage). With no copy set aside the first
 * option just attacks.
 *
 * **Ice Blast (46010)**, Hero Action, not an attack: choose a player; attach a set-aside copy to the villain and to each
 * minion engaged with that player (one copy each, `blastStep`), then deal 3 damage to each enemy with a copy attached
 * (all of them, engaged with that player or not; an enemy with two copies takes 3 once). Plain damage: guard and
 * retaliate do not apply. The "freeze" moment is not raised (only Iceman's identity ability raises it).
 *
 * **Chill Out! (46011)**, Hero Action (thwart): remove 3 threat from a scheme, then attach a set-aside copy of Frostbite
 * to an enemy (any enemy, engaged or not). With no copy set aside the enemy is not asked for.
