/**
 * Whole games with Iceman's precon (`iceman-aggression`, cards 46002-46023, 40 cards plus the six Permanent Frostbite)
 * through the real engine and the real wave 8 scripts, played by the card-name-agnostic greedy driver
 * (`../../../testing/driver.ts`) one command at a time, so every state is checked against the invariants below and an
 * observer reads the events for his signature mechanics (the `seen` tally; the last test asserts each was seen).
 *
 * Scenarios: Core's Rhino with Sauron (his pack's modular set) added to the deck, the way a hero pack's own modular set
 * is played at a Core scenario. `coreScenario` only accepts the playable pool's modular sets (the wave is not joined to
 * the playable pool), so Sauron's cards are appended to the built `encounterDeck` with the two helpers the builder uses
 * (`encounterCardsOf`, `modularSetupCardIds`). Second, games through `wave8Scenario("unus")` (the new builder), which
 * does not include Sauron, so those check the builder, Frostbite and the nemesis set. Two-player rounds pair him with
 * Spider-Man's Core deck.
 *
 * Invariants checked after every command:
 * - no engine error on a command the driver chose from legal candidates (`sessionApply` reports it);
 * - no prompt without an answer (RRG 1.8 "Choices"): `minSelections` fits the options offered;
 * - the game never rests between steps with nothing pending outside a player turn (RRG Appendix II, pp. 51-52);
 * - no card instance sits in two zones; every card a deck started with is still somewhere;
 * - Frostbite (46002) is Permanent (6 copies set aside at setup, wave 6 section 3.74): the six copies are always all
 *   somewhere, a copy attached to anything is attached to an enemy, and never more than six are attached;
 * - every enemy carrying Frostbite has its ATK or SCH lowered by it (46002 constant: -1 each, to the floor of 0);
 * - the session log replays to the identical final state (the engine's determinism contract).
 *
 * Mechanics read from events: "Freeze!" (46001a: an Interrupt on his basic attack or basic defense that attaches a
 * set-aside Frostbite to the enemy and raises the moment "freeze"; nothing set aside, nothing attached and no moment),
 * Frostbite returning to the set-aside area after the host activates (46002, Q35 = A), Arctic Attack (46009), Ice Blast
 * (46010: one copy per enemy, 3 damage to each enemy with a copy), Chill Out! (46011: 3 threat removed, then a copy),
 * Frozen Solid (46007: the activation is replaced), Ice Wall (46008: attack damage to an identity lands on it), Cool Off
 * (46001b), Take That! (46016, one attack, Q48), the hazard extra deal (RRG 1.8 "Hazard Icon", p. 21), and ready-and-
 * draw at the end of the player phase (RRG 1.8 "Player Phase").
 *
 * Frostbite 46002's "or leaves play" half is checked in every state: once everything has resolved, no copy sits
 * unattached in a play area (a copy whose host left play was set aside).
 *
 * Hot-Headed 46024's Forced Response is checked per window: while it is in play, it answers each Frostbite attached.
 *
 * Cryokinetic Perception 46005: each use draws a card, and a card without ICE does not ready Iceman. Shark-Girl 46012,
 * Keep Up the Pressure 46018, Snow Clone 46003's reduction (Q38) and Surprise Move 46015 after "Freeze!" are registered
 * and proven in their own modules' tests (`../aspect-basic.test.ts`, `./support-upgrades-allies.test.ts`); these games
 * assert nothing card-specific about them.
