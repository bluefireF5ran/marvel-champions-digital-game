 *
 * **Frostbite (46002)** is a permanent upgrade attached to an enemy, from its owner's set-aside area. Its constant takes
 * 1 from the host's SCH and ATK, once per copy, to the engine's floor of 0. Its Forced Response, "After attached enemy
 * activates or leaves play, set this card aside", is `on.either(on.enemyActivates("host"), on.leavesPlay("host"))` with
 * `moveCards(cards(self), "setAside")`. The activation half includes Q35 = A (a copy attached during an activation, by a
 * basic defense or by Ice Wall, is set aside after that same activation: no grace activation). The leaves-play half:
 * the permanent copy stays in play unattached when its host leaves (`staysWhenHostLeaves`; the RRG 1.8 "Permanent" rule
 * would remove it from the game, p. 32, but the card and its rules insert set it aside), and the engine's
 * `cardLeavesPlay` names the attachments it stranded, so the copy still reads the leaving card as its host and is set
 * aside (section 3.61).
 *
 * **Snow Clone (46003)** cannot have upgrades attached (an encounter attachment can go on it). Its consequential damage
 * is reduced by 1 after it attacks an enemy with Frostbite attached (`46003.snow-clone-constant-2`). The enemy is read
 * live while it is in play and as it was when the attack was made once the attack has defeated it (Q38 = A; ruling
 * February 8, 2026 - Ruling 1: the engine's last known information for an attack's target), so a defeating attack
 * keeps the reduction although the Frostbite is no longer attached by then.
 *
 * **Power Belt (46004)**: +3 hit points on the identity it is attached to; a hero resource that generates a wild
 * resource only for an ICE card.
 *
 * **Cryokinetic Perception (46005)**, Hero Response: after "Freeze!" resolves (the moment the identity raises once a
 * copy is attached), exhaust this card to draw 1 card; if the card drawn has the ICE trait, ready Iceman. The draw
 * binds the card it drew (section 3.70), read in hand by its printed traits. An empty deck and discard pile draw
 * nothing and ready nothing.
 *
 * **Ice Slide (46006)**: +1 THW, ATK and DEF and the AERIAL trait for Iceman on his hero face; its Forced Response
 * shuffles it into its controller's deck after they change to alter-ego form.
 *
 * **Frozen Solid (46007)**: Forced Interrupt when the attached enemy would activate: the activation is replaced by
 * discarding Frozen Solid, then a set-aside Frostbite is attached to that enemy. The activation did not happen, so
 * nothing answers "after it activates" and the new copy stays (section 3.61).
 *
 * **Ice Wall (46008)**: Forced Interrupt when an identity (any player's) would take damage from an attack: the damage
 * is placed on Ice Wall instead. Then, at 8 or more damage on it, it is discarded and the enemy that just attacked gets
 * a Frostbite (set aside again when that activation ends, Q35 = A).
