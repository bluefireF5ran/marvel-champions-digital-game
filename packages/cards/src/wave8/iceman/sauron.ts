/**
 * Modular encounter set `sauron` (Iceman pack, docs/phase7-wave8.md section 7.2, 3.70).
 *
 * **Sauron (46029)**: When Revealed searches the encounter deck and discard pile for Life Drain, reveals it and shuffles.
 * Boost: heals 3 from the activating enemy and gives it a tough status card (healed first, so a tough card is kept
 * even when there was nothing to heal).
 *
 * **Sauron Lives! (46030)**: 3 threat regardless of players, a crisis icon, 3 boost icons (data). When Defeated: the
 * player who defeated it searches the encounter deck and discard pile for Sauron and deals him to themself facedown.
 * Only those two zones are searched, so a Sauron already in play (or in the victory display) finds nothing.
 *
 * **Life Drain (46031)**: the host (the minion with the highest printed hit points) is data. Its first ref resolves
 * when it is revealed: the host activates against the revealer (an attack in hero form, a scheme in alter-ego form);
 * if no minion activated, the card gains surge. With no minion in play the card is discarded unattached and still
 * gains surge. Forced Interrupt: when the host attacks you, you take 2 damage and it gets a tough status card.
 *
 * **The Eye of Sauron (46032)**: discard the top 2 cards of your deck (3 with Sauron in play), then per resource icon
 * discarded, in the printed order: [energy] threat on the main scheme, [mental] discard from hand, [physical] damage
 * to your identity, [wild] exhaust a character you control. Each icon is its own instruction.
 *
 * Cards (4):
 * - 46029 Sauron (minion)
 * - 46030 Sauron Lives! (side_scheme)
 * - 46031 Life Drain (attachment)
 * - 46032 The Eye of Sauron (treachery)
