 * Jubilee pack aspect and basic player cards, docs/phase7-wave8.md §7.3, §3.62, §3.64, §3.67, §3.70; Q33 = B, Q34 = A,
 * Q38 = A, Q40 = A, Q48.
 *
 * Cards (14):
 * - 47011 Chamber (ally)
 * - 47012 Husk (ally)
 * - 47013 Disguise (upgrade)
 * - 47014 Waylay (event)
 * - 47015 Three Steps Ahead (event)
 * - 47016 Generation X (player_side_scheme)
 * - 47017 The Power of Justice (resource)
 * - 47018 Synch (ally)
 * - 47019 Cell Phone (upgrade)
 * - 47020 X-Gene (upgrade)
 * - 47021 Multitalented (event)
 * - 47022 Unlikely Duo (event)
 * - 47028 Mutant Mayhem (event)
 * - 47029 Serve and Protect (event)
 *
 * **Reprints, one script under two ids**: The Power of Justice 47017 is Core 01062's, X-Gene 47020 is `rogue` 38019's
 * (raw `duplicate_of_code`).
 *
 * **Data ids.** Husk 47012 lists `husk-interrupt` alone, and Multitalented 47021 lists `multitalented-constant` alone
 * (it holds the whole Hero Action: the header line and its three bullets). Both are registered.
 *
 * **Chamber (47011)**: 1 less consequential damage after he attacks a confused enemy. The enemy is read live while it
 * is in play and as it was when the attack was made once the attack has defeated it (Q38 = A, FFG ruling February 8,
 * 2026 (1): the engine's last known information for an attack's target), so a defeating attack keeps the reduction.
 *
 * **Husk (47012)**: a resource cost of a chosen size, 1 to 3. More may be generated and is overpaid (owner decision,
 * 2026-10-08, section 4.1 row 78; RRG p. 13), so each named type is read from the resources paid (Q34 = A), a wild as
 * its player declared it (Q33 = B); when which three were paid changes a line, she says which (row 79). [energy] adds
 * 1 to the power, [mental] heals 1 from her, [physical] readies her after the use: when the thwart or attack ends,
 * which is before its consequential damage is dealt (pinned by the test "the order, as built").
 *
 * **Waylay (47014)** is an (attack)-labeled ability that only deals damage. Q48 = A makes it an attack: the engine
 * resolves it as one attack by the identity (attack damage, retaliate, "after you attack"). Written the natural way,
 * the target chosen among the enemies the identity may attack (guard).
 * The 7 damage is read from the thwarted scheme: the thwart left it with no threat (a thwart's own event carries no
 * `lastThreatRemoved`, which only the removal records).
 *
 * **Three Steps Ahead (47015)** is one (thwart)-labeled ability: every removal is an instance of the one thwart
 * (RRG 1.8 "Thwart", p. 44), the same scheme may be chosen again.
 *
 * **Multitalented (47021)** is (attack)/(thwart) in one ability and resolves in the printed order: damage, threat,
 * heal. Like Waylay its damage line is damage only, and is the ability's one attack (Q48). Whatever was paid it is an
 * attack and a thwart by Jubilee (FFG ruling June 26, 2025; RRG 1.8 p. 26; contributor's rules call (bluefireF5ran),
 * 2026-10-15): with no [physical] paid it is an attack on nobody (nothing retaliates; "after you attack" answers).
 *
 * **Unlikely Duo (47022)**: confuse an enemy, then attack a confused enemy (possibly another) for 4.
 *
 * **Serve and Protect (47029)**: any placement on the main scheme is prevented; the two characters that paid are given
 * a tough status card each.
 *
 * **Cell Phone (47019)**, docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.64: choosing the player is part of the cost, so the Action is offered
 * only while some player has a ready character with a legal basic attack or thwart (RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 13), and only
 * such a player can be chosen, the controller included. That player picks the character, the power and its target and
 * makes the ordinary basic power (`basicPowerBy`) at +1 THW and +1 ATK for that use. The charge counters, and the
 * discard when the last is spent, are the uses keyword's (card data).
 *
 * **Generation X (47016)** constant: each X-MEN character gets +1 THW while it is making a basic thwart against this
 * scheme (`thwartInProgress`, §3.70): only the character thwarting, only against Generation X, only a basic thwart
 * (an event's or ability's thwart is not a character's basic power; a basic thwart made with ATK gains nothing from a
 * THW bonus).
 *
 * **Mutant Mayhem (47028)**, Alliance, Hero Action: the cost returns one X-FORCE ally and one X-MEN ally to their
 * owners' hands (two picks, one card cannot be both; as an alliance card's cost any player's allies can pay, RRG 1.8
 * "Alliance", p. 6); then each owner plays their ally from hand, ignoring its resource cost. With either ally missing
 * the cost cannot be paid and the card cannot be played.
