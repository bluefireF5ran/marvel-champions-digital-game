 * "Lost" Child), docs/phase7-wave8.md section 7.3, 3.63, 3.70; Q37. Real commands in a real game: her starter deck
 * (`jubilee-justice`) against Rhino (Core, standard, no modular set). Spider-Man (Justice precon) is the second seat
 * where two players matter. A boost card that must do nothing is Advance 01186 (0 boost icons). Hands are staged by
 * relabeling cards (test-only surgery on cards whose own text is not under test): Cell Phone 47019 [energy], Disguise
 * 47013 [mental], Waylay 47014 [physical], X-Gene 47020 [wild]. Allies: Synch 47018 (cost 3), Husk 47012 (cost 4).
 *
 * The form-change cost (section 3.63) is paid with the change-form command itself (`payment`), as a play is paid for:
 * `legalActions` lists the change only when her hand can pay it, with a payment that does.
