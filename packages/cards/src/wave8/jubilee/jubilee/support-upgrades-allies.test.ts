 * Q34 = A, Q36 = A. Real commands in a real game: her starter deck (`jubilee-justice`) against Rhino, with the pool
 * Core and cycle 7 plus the Wolverine and Mutant Genesis packs and her own (the Wolverine hero, the ally Wolverine 32041 and Lay the Trap are earlier waves'
 * cards). Payments are built from real cards by the icons they print: Cell Phone 47019 [energy], Disguise 47013
 * [mental], Waylay 47014 [physical], X-Gene 47020 [wild], Plasmoid Energy 47010a [energy][mental] / b [energy][physical]
 * / c [mental][physical], and the Core Set's Strength 01090 ([physical][physical]). Every answer to a `declareWildTypes`
 * choice is given by the test (an unanswered one throws).
 *
 * Her events that read types (Flash of Light 47008a, cost 2, "3 removed, and with 2 types an enemy confused";
 * Firecracker 47007a, cost 2, "4 damage, and with 2 types a stun") are the events the Coat and the Sunglasses answer.
 * For Justice! 01060 (a THWART event that reads no types) and Haymaker 01087 (an ATTACK event that reads none) are the
 * events for which only the upgrade reads the payment. A cost of 3 or 0 is a fixture (`withCost`, the printed cost
 * changed in this game's pool), as in the events module's test.
 *
 * Disguise 47013 is the unscripted `aspect-basic` module's: where a test needs an alter-ego form's thwart (Q36 = A),
 * a fixture ability is registered under Disguise's own ability id in a copy of the registry (stated at the test).
