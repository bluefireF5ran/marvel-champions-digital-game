 * Magneto pack aspect and basic player cards, docs/phase7-wave8.md §7.5, §3.78, §3.81.
 *
 * Cards (20):
 * - 49012 M (ally)
 * - 49013 Kid Omega (ally)
 * - 49014 Phoenix (ally)
 * - 49015 Cyclops (ally)
 * - 49016 Won't Stay Down (support)
 * - 49017 Squared Off (event)
 * - 49018 Noble Sacrifice (event)
 * - 49019 "You Got This!" (event)
 * - 49020 New Recruits (player_side_scheme)
 * - 49021 White Queen (ally)
 * - 49022 Face the Past (event)
 * - 49023 Deft Focus (upgrade)
 * - 49024 Energy (resource)
 * - 49025 Genius (resource)
 * - 49026 Strength (resource)
 * - 49033 Surge (ally)
 * - 49034 Anole (ally)
 * - 49035 Bling! (ally)
 * - 49036 Indra (ally)
 * - 49037 Children of the Atom (support)
 *
 * **Reprints, one script under two ids**: Deft Focus 49023 is `gmw` 16024's (raw `duplicate_of_code`; the Basic
 * classification is an erratum already in the data). Energy, Genius and Strength print no ability.
 *
 * **M (49012)**, Response after she enters play: defeat a minion with fewer remaining hit points than she has, chosen
 * among the minions the comparison allows (`remainingHpCompare`, §3.81; her own remaining hit points are read each time
 * a minion is tested, so an M that entered play damaged compares with what she has left). With no such minion the
 * Response is not offered. A defeat is not damage: a tough status card does not stop it.
 *
 * **Kid Omega (49013)**: each bullet is a spend, offered only to a player who can pay it (RRG 1.8 "Choose (Option)",
 * p. 12), and the effect follows only a spend that was made.
 *
 * **Cyclops (49015)**: Q46 = A, the +1 applies to every instance of damage the enemy takes from an attack. The grant
 * names the chosen enemy through its slot, lasts to the end of the phase and reaches every player's attacks.
 *
 * **"You Got This!" (49019)**, Hero Response after the hero exhausts for a basic thwart or attack: the cost discards
 * an ally the player controls and records its THW, ATK and DEF as they stood in play (`stats`, §3.81: Surge with her
 * bonus adds 3 to an attack, though the card in the discard pile reads 2); the matching power is added to the hero's
 * for this use and the hero is readied. With no ally to discard it is not offered. "Matching" is the stat powering
 * the basic power (§4.1 Q54 = B): an attack adds ATK, a thwart THW, and a thwart made with ATK (a scheme with assault,
 * RRG 1.8 p. 8) adds the ally's ATK, as Sisterly Bond 43007 does.
 *
 * **New Recruits (49020)**: Victory 0, 2 threat per player and "Play only if your identity has the X-Men trait" are
 * data. Its When Defeated is each player's own choice among the set-aside NEW allies (the linked allies, set aside
 * ownerless at setup) and the chosen ally is taken into that player's hand, who owns it from then on (RRG 1.8
 * "Linked (Card Title)", p. 27).
 *
 * **Surge, Anole, Bling! and Indra (49033 to 49036)**: Linked is data. While the controller's identity has the MUTANT
 * or X-MEN trait as it stands (Children of the Atom can give X-MEN), the ally has its bonus and is left out of the ally
 * limit; Bling! has toughness, so she enters play with her tough status card only if the condition holds then.
 *
 * **White Queen (49021)**: the "Play only if" line names two traits, which `playRestrictions` cannot hold, so it is the
 * constant. The Response lets the player pick the character and then which status card of it to discard.
 *
 * **Face the Past (49022)**: searches the three areas the card names (not a find: a nemesis minion in play is out of
 * reach), so it is playable only while one is there. In The Wrecking Crew only the active villain's encounter deck
 * exists (ruling January 17, 2026 - Ruling 5), which the encounter selectors already read, and the revealed minion goes
 * to that deck's discard pile when it is defeated. "You cannot attack the villain this phase" is a lasting rule on the
 * player, so it covers the identity and every ally the player controls (docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.81).
