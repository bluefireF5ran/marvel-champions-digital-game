/**
 * Modular encounter set `crazy_gang` (Nightcrawler pack, docs/phase7-wave8.md §7.4, §3.75, §3.81, Q44). Waits on no
 * engine work now: §3.75's `dealAsEncounterCard` of a card in play and `passEncounterCard` / `nextAfter` are in.
 *
 * Starting threat 2 per player, the acceleration icon and each minion's SCH 0 / boost icons are data (Tweedledope has
 * 1 boost icon and no star, Q44 = B). "Already confused / stunned" is read before the status is given, the convention of
 * Arcade's Funhouse and Hall of Mirrors. A permanent upgrade is not a legal pick for Tweedledope's discard (RRG p. 32),
 * so the pick excludes one. Queen of Hearts tests "already in play" before searching, since a revealed Crazy Gang would
 * otherwise be in play by then; her search finds nothing in that case. The card's closing "(Shuffle.)" comes last, so
 * the facedown card is the top card of the unshuffled deck.
 *
 * Executioner: the lowest remaining hit points among every identity and ally of every player; the first player breaks
 * a tie (RRG p. 19). "An ally this attack defeats" (the target or a defender) goes to the removed-from-game area
 * instead of the discard pile: a `defeatDestination` rule lasting to the end of exactly the attack this ability
 * initiates, so Executioner's later villain-phase attacks are untouched.
 *
 * Cards (6):
 * - 48033 The Crazy Gang (side_scheme)
 * - 48034 Queen of Hearts (minion)
 * - 48035 Jester (minion)
 * - 48036 Executioner (minion)
 * - 48037 Tweedledope (minion)
 * - 48038 "Off with His Head!" (treachery)
