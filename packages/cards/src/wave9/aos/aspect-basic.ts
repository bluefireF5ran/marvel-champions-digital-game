/**
 * Wave 9 scripting module `aos/aspect-basic` (docs/phase7-wave9.md section 8.4, 3.1, 3.6, 3.7, 3.10, 3.12, 3.35).
 * `card-groups.ts` maps this module to the ids below; keep the two in step.
 *
 * **50012.victoria-hand-response**: "ready a S.H.I.E.L.D. support" (any player's, the text does not say "you control").
 *
 * **50013.slingshot-action**: a printed Action that works from the hand (`inHand`): spend an [energy] resource, choose a
 * player, put her into play under that player's control; at the end of the phase, if she is still in play, return her
 * to her owner's hand.
 *
 * **50015.agents-of-shield-constant**: "If each of your characters has the S.H.I.E.L.D. trait, this card gains:
 * 'Interrupt: ...'" is the interrupt itself with a `while` on that condition ("this card gains" is an ability of the
 * card, spec section 3.3). "When you reveal" is the revealing player (`playerIs: "controller"`).
 *
 * **50016 / 50017 / 50018 / 50019 / 50020**: Uses supports; the Uses counters are data, the cost of each action is
 * exhausting and removing one counter. Removing the last one discards the card (RRG 1.8 "Uses", p. 46). The three
 * vehicles' "choose a player" choices are made by the card's controller; The Circe's ally is put into play by the
 * chosen player. The Pericles gives its two status cards to different kinds of card, so the ally-or-minion half is
 * guarded by a `while` (an action with two required targets is only checked for its first at initiation).
 *
 * **50021.dum-dum-dugan-interrupt**: the same card as `sm` 27047 (a reprint under a new code): "exhaust up to 3" is a
 * cost of 1 to 3 (RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 14), so declining the interrupt is how to exhaust none.
 *
 * **50022**: "cannot defend" is a constant rule; the Forced Response asks whether to spend a [mental] resource and, if
 * the player does not (or cannot), deals her ATK to the player's hero and removes her from the game.
 *
 * **50023.melinda-may-response**: looks at the top card of the encounter deck and may discard it.
 *
 * **50024.super-spies-action**: three placements, each an all-purpose counter or a threat token, each on a S.H.I.E.L.D.
 * support or a suit form upgrade, any player's. Team-Up and "Max 1 per deck" are data.
 *
 * **50028.front-organization-interrupt**: "When an encounter card effect would discard a card you control, discard
 * Front Organization instead of discarding that card." A replacement (RRG 1.8 "Replacement Effect", p. 37) on the
 * discard of a card you control, heard only when an encounter card's effect is what discards it
 * (`on.cardYouControlDiscarded({ by: "encounterCard" })`): a treachery's When Revealed, a Boost, a minion's or scheme's
 * ability. Not offered for a player card's effect, a cost (RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 13), a defeat by damage from any source
 * ("Defeat", p. 15: the game discards the defeated ally, not the card that dealt the damage), an attachment going with
 * its discarded host ("Leaves Play", p. 27) or a uses card emptied. There is no arrow, so discarding Front Organization
 * is the replacement's effect, not a cost; it is optional (a plain Interrupt), and "you" is whoever controls it ("Play
 * under any player's control" is data). Its own discard is not offered to it.
 * **In play, in your hand and in your deck** (the owner's decision, spec §4.1 Q20 = B): the card says "a card you
 * control", not "in play", and RRG 1.8 "Ownership and Control" (p. 31) has a player control "the cards in their own
 * out-of-play areas (such as the hand, the deck, and the discard pile)". A card in play is heard as it leaves play
 * (`cardLeavesPlay.by`), a card in your hand or deck as `cardBeingDiscarded`, and the replaced card stays where it
 * was: in the hand, or on the deck in its place. A random discard from hand picks its card first; each card of
 * "discard N cards" is its own discard, and Front Organization, discarded by the first it answers, is not offered
 * the rest. The hand-size discard at the end of the phase is the game's rule, and "discard cards from the top of your
 * deck until …" is not announced by the engine; neither is offered.
 *
 * **Second half (50047 to 50058).** Reprints under a new code alias the source card's script (checked against the
 * source's data in the tests): Agent Coulson 50047 (`bkw` 08011), Quake 50048 (08012), Global Logistics 50049 (`sm`
 * 27043), Under Surveillance 50053 (Core 06031's "Increase the target threat value" constant; the attach half is data),
 * Sky-Destroyer 50057 (`sm` 27055).
 *
 * **50050.informant-interrupt**: "When a minion schemes" (the villain's scheme is not a minion's) with the activation
 * removing threat instead of placing it (`modifyAttack({ removesThreat })`). No label: unlike Psychic Manipulation's
 * "(thwart)", this is not a thwart.
 *
 * **50052.prism-dust-response**: "Hero Response (attack): After a minion enters play" (any minion, engaged with anyone,
 * revealed or put into play): confuse it and deal 2 damage to it. A Vulnerable minion is discarded by the status
 * before the damage lands (spec 3.1, engine rule), so it is not defeated.
 *
 * **50054.nick-fury-sr-forced-response**: the three modes are an option each; the end-of-round discard is part of the
 * same Forced Response (queued whichever mode was chosen) and only discards him if he is still in play.
 *
 * **50055 / 50056**: the cost reduction is a hand-active cost modifier read while the playing player's identity has
 * the S.H.I.E.L.D. trait. Jemma's resource ability generates [mental] for a Tech card only (`generatesFor`). Fitz's
 * Alter-Ego Action searches the deck (only), may find nothing, and shuffles.
 *
 * **50051.intelligence-response**: "After a player is dealt an encounter card, discard Intelligence → look at each
 * encounter card dealt to each player and the top card of the encounter deck. You may swap any number of those cards."
 * "A player" is any player (`on.aPlayerIsDealtAnEncounterCard()`, `encounterCardDealt`), in either form (a plain
 * Response). Each dealt card is a triggering condition, but the cards one step deals share one response window (RRG
 * 1.8 "Triggering Condition", p. 45), so in step three it is offered once, after every player's card and the hazard
 * cards are dealt and before any is revealed; a card ability's deal and a deck that ran out offer it too. So does the
 * card the surge keyword deals (the owner's decision, spec §4.1 Q19 = B; RRG 1.8 "Surge", p. 42: the player "deals
 * themself a facedown encounter card"): offered when that card is dealt, before it is revealed, and a card swapped
 * into its place is the card the surge reveals. "Reveal the top card of the encounter deck" deals nothing and is not
 * heard. Discarding it is the cost, so each copy answers one deal; the card prints no limit ("Max 1 per player" is
 * data). The look and the swap are §3.12's `lookAtAndRearrange`: its controller alone sees the cards, every position
 * keeps a card, and the arrangement that swaps nothing is allowed.
 *
 * **50058.practiced-plan-response**: "After you discard a Preparation card you control": a card you control leaving
 * play to the discard pile (`cardLeavesPlay`, `to: discard`). Returns that card from the discard pile to your hand.
 *
 * **50014.organizational-support-interrupt**: "Interrupt: When you spend this card, exhaust up to 3 allies and/or
 * supports you control that share a Trait with your identity -> generate the printed resources on each card exhausted
 * this way." The card's own text as it is spent from hand (RRG 1.8 "Resource Card", p. 37), so it is `whenSpentGenerate`:
 * used only by the payment entry that spends the card, the spender's cards pay it, and what it generates joins that
 * payment and may overpay it ("Cost", p. 13). "Up to 3" is 1 to 3 (p. 14); "your identity" is the side that is up
 * (`sharesTraitWith: identityOf(you)`), so Maria Hill's hero-side trait grant to her allies counts in hero form only.
 *
 * 50025 Energy, 50026 Genius and 50027 Strength print no ability (Max 1 per deck is data).
