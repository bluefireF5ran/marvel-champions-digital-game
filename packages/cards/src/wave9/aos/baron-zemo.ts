/**
 * Baron Zemo, the scenario frame (MC50 pp. 18 to 19; docs/phase7-wave9.md sections 3.26, 3.29 (a) and (b), 4.1 Q1, Q28
 * and Q30). The encounter cards 50170 to 50177 follow the frame below.
 *
 * **The villain**: each of the two cards (A for standard, B for expert) has a masked face, whose Forced Interrupt
 * resets his hit points (12, 16) and removes 3 secret counters from among the Board Member environments, and an Unmasked
 * face (the main scheme's 3A flips him, 50169a), whose Forced Interrupt makes each activation against a player cost
 * either secret counters (1, 2) on a Board Member card or an additional boost card. Steady is data.
 *
 * **Zemo's Manipulations (50167a / 50167b)**: Setup deals the two hidden evidence piles (`aim`: one card of each kind;
 * `shield`: the other six) and places 2 secret counters on each Board Member environment (the Setup keyword already put
 * them into play). The Response is two independent offers to the first player: place 2 secret counters on a Board
 * Member environment with none, to gain 2 cards from the `shield` pile (Q30 = A: not offered while the pile is empty);
 * and advance to stage 2A. The campaign branches (1 card instead of 2, no Setup counters or deal) are the campaign
 * pass's (docs/phase7-wave9.md section 3.75).
 *
 * **The Accusation (50168a / 50168b)**: 2A asks the first player for a combination not crossed out. 2B's When Revealed
 * is four steps in order: identify the mole (the `aim` pile turns faceup; no `revealHiddenPile` first), 1 secret
 * counter on each Board Member card (either face) per wrong guess, 3 more on the accused when the accused is not the
 * mole, advance to stage 3A. The four `-constant` refs the data lists are those numbered steps, not abilities.
 *
 * **Fighting Zemo (50169a / 50169b)**: 3A flips Zemo to his Unmasked face, resets his hit points to its printed value
 * and finds Baron Zemo's Sword for him. 3B flips the mole (its environment face; the 2B penalties can already have
 * flipped it) to its attachment face, which keeps its secret counters (Q1 = A), and places 1[per_hero] threat per
 * secret counter on each Board Member attachment, one placement per attachment.
 *
 * **The encounter deck (50170 to 50177)**: the Sword's Forced Response answers an attack by its host that defeats a
 * character; S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent's Forced Interrupt answers its own activation or defeat; Undermine Support taxes
 * readying a support; both side schemes remove 1[per_hero] secret counters when defeated; Might Makes Right and The
 * Ends Justify the Means finish with secret counters removed from among the Board Member environments (the first
 * player splits them, Q28 = A). The unscripted refs are in `BARON_ZEMO_SKIPPED`.
 *

 * - 50165a Baron Zemo (villain)
