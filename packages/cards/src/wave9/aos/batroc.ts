/**
 * Batroc (MC50 p. 11; docs/phase7-wave9.md section 2.3, 3.5, 3.13 to 3.16), first half: the villain 50086a (standard,
 * 8 hit points) and 50086b (expert, 12; hit points are fixed, not per player), the three main scheme stages
 * 50087a/b to 50089a/b and the Alert Level environment 50090a/b. Second half: see "Second half" below.
 *
 * **Stage advances.** "When the last threat is removed from this scheme" is scripted as a forced response to the
 * removal (`on.lastThreatRemoved`), the reading `gmw/escape-the-museum.ts` documents: the removal must have applied
 * before "the last threat" is true. Stage 1 and 2 are left that way, never by completion (`completionLoses` is data).
 * Stage 2B puts a set-aside Rescued Captive into play exhausted under a player the first player chooses, then the
 * first player chooses between advancing and 3[per_hero] threat more. With no captive left set aside none enters.
 * Stage 3B redirects every enemy attack to a Rescued Captive the first player chooses (a state check ends the game
 * with none in play, and a win at no threat).
 *
 * **Alert Level.** Threat on an environment is only tokens (section 3.7 (a)). Both faces hold threat, flip at 4
 * [per_hero] (Low) or lose the game at it (High), and gain threat from any ally or minion defeated except by its own
 * consequential damage. The flip keeps every token (RRG "Flip", p. 20) and is not a reveal.
 *
 * **Second half** (50091 to 50097). Vulnerable on the Embassy Guard / Patrol is the engine's keyword rule (section 3.1),
 * so a stun or a confuse discards them without a defeat: their When Defeated and Alert Level do not answer. Their
 * High-side surge / incite 1 is a constant keyword grant to the card itself, `while` Alert Level shows its High trait
 * (a revealed minion has it before it enters play). Rescued Captive does not count against the ally limit and no card
 * ability removes it (damage still defeats it, Victory -1). Heightened Reflexes: the interrupt to damage Batroc would
 * take prevents 2 and removes a leap counter; its boost attaches it to Batroc, and a card attached from out of play
 * enters play by it, so it arrives with its 4 leap counters. Leaping Kick: the first player picks among the allies tied
 * for the most remaining hit points (RRG "First Player", p. 19); the attack is an ordinary enemy attack on that ally,
 * so Batroc's own "After Batroc attacks" answers it (owner decision Q5 = A). Security Cameras (Hero) resolves once per
 * character the player controls (`forEachCard`), each exhausted or paid for with threat on Alert Level.
 *
 * Cards (10):
 * - 50086a Batroc (villain)
 * - 50087a Infiltrate A.I.M. Island Embassy (main_scheme)
 * - 50090a Alert Level (environment)
 * - 50091 Rescued Captive (ally)
 * - 50092 Heightened Reflexes (attachment)
 * - 50093 Embassy Guard (minion)
 * - 50094 Embassy Patrol (minion)
 * - 50095 Commandeer Security Office (side_scheme)
 * - 50096 Leaping Kick (treachery)
 * - 50097 Security Cameras (treachery)
