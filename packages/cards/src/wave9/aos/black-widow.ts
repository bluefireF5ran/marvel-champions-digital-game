 * (50064 to 50066, one record with three stages), The Widow's Web (50067a/b) and the four attachments (50068 to
 * 50071). Hit points, ATK/SCH, keywords, boost icons and the Gauntlet's +1 ATK / Night Vision Goggles' +1 SCH are data.
 *
 * **Black Widow I-III**: a Forced Interrupt to any attack on her; the three stages behave alike (stage I's "ignoring any
 * crisis icons" is a reminder, see above). Stages II and III place 2 and 3 per hero threat on the main scheme when
 * revealed.
 *
 * **The Widow's Web**: Setup: each player searches the encounter deck for a minion and puts it into play engaged with
 * them (not revealed), in player order, then one shuffle. The acceleration is X per hero, X the villain's stage number
 * (`printedX`).
 *
 * **Attachments**: "Preparation" is a label of its own, resolved only by the villain's interrupt, never as a boost.
 * The Gauntlet attaches itself to the villain from the discard pile; Grappling Hook has the attacker discard an event
 * from hand; Night Vision Goggles attach themselves and give every encounter card that prints no Preparation a granted
 * one (`GOGGLES_GRANTED_PREPARATION`, registry-only); Stun Net attaches to the attacking character after the attack.
 *
 * Cards (14):
 * - 50064 Black Widow (villain)
 * - 50067a The Widow's Web (main_scheme)
 * - 50068 Black Widow's Gauntlet (attachment)
 * - 50069 Grappling Hook (attachment)
