 * boxes (+1 ATK, +1 SCH, +1 ATK) are data.
 *
 * **Board Member environments (50181a to 50183a)**: a state check flips the card at 4 secret counters (3 in expert
 * mode) to its attachment face, which keeps its secret counters (Q1 = A). The Hero Action spends two resources of the
 * card's type, removes a secret counter, and only then (RRG 1.8 "'Then'", p. 44) does its effect: heal 1 damage from a
 * friendly character, remove 2 threat from a scheme, deal 2 damage to an enemy.
 *
 * **Board Member attachments (50181b to 50183b)**: a Forced Response answers each placing of secret counters here
 * once, however many were placed. The first player chooses on an encounter card's behalf (RRG 1.8 "First Player",
 * p. 19). The last paragraph is a state check: 3 Board Member attachments in play lose the game.
 *
 * **A.I.M. Interference (50184a to 50184c)**: When Revealed places 1 secret counter on each Board Member card; the
 * revealing player may first spend X [type] resources, X chosen once and paid in one payment, to prevent X of those
 * placings (`placeSecrets`). The boost resolves the card's When Revealed abilities, Incite 1 included (FFG ruling,
 * September 22, 2026; owner decision 2026-10-20, revising docs/phase7-wave4.md §4 Q23), in the order the first player
 * chooses (RRG 1.8 "Simultaneous Resolution", p. 40).
