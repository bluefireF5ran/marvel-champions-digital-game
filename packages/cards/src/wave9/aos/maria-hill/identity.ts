 * Wave 9 scripting module `aos/maria-hill/identity` (docs/phase7-wave9.md section 8.4, 3.6, 3.10).
 *
 * Cards (1 card, 2 faces):
 * - 50001a Maria Hill (hero_identity) / 50001b Maria Hill (alter ego)
 *
 * **50001a.maria-hill-constant**: "Each ally you control gains the S.H.I.E.L.D. trait." Printed on the hero face, so it
 * holds only while Maria Hill is in hero form.
 *
 * **50001a.reassignment**: "Action: Move 1 all-purpose counter from a S.H.I.E.L.D. support to another S.H.I.E.L.D.
 * support. (Limit once per round.)" Only a S.H.I.E.L.D. support holding a counter can be the source and the
 * destination is a different S.H.I.E.L.D. support. The counter is retyped by the card it lands on, and a uses support
 * emptied by the move is discarded (RRG 1.8 "All-Purpose Counter", p. 6; "Uses", p. 46; docs/phase7-wave9.md 3.6).
 * With no source holding a counter, or no second support, the ability has no legal target and cannot be initiated, so
 * the once-per-round limit is not spent.
 *
 * **50001b.maria-hill-action**: "Action: Exhaust Maria Hill -> search your deck for a S.H.I.E.L.D. support and add
 * it to your hand." The whole deck is searched and shuffled afterward, also when none is found (RRG 1.8 "Search", p.
 * 39).
 *
 * **50001b.maria-hill-constant** is her deck-building rule ("You may include the maximum number of copies of 3
 * S.H.I.E.L.D. supports ... from aspects other than your chosen aspect"). It is carried entirely by card data
 * (`deckbuilding.offAspectPackages`, checked in `engine/src/deck.ts`; docs/phase7-wave9.md 3.10), not by an ability.
