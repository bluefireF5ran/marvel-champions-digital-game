/**
 * Rules QA for the first three scenarios of the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. box and their sets (`aos`: Black Widow 50064 to
 * 50079, A.I.M. Abduction 50080 to 50082, A.I.M. Science 50083 to 50085, Batroc 50086 to 50097, Batroc's Brigade 50098
 * to 50102, M.O.D.O.K. 50103 to 50124, Scientist Supreme 50125 to 50128 and S.H.I.E.L.D. 50178 to 50180; Thunderbolts,
 * Baron Zemo, the Executive Board and the Thunderbolt minion sets are a later audit): the interactions the module tests
 * and the scenario games do not assert, each tied to an RRG 1.8 section (`mc_rulesreference_v18_compressed.pdf`), an FFG
 * ruling by its date heading (marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md), the box rulebook (MC50) or an owner answer
 * (docs/phase7-wave9.md section 4.1). A `FINDING` comment marks a case where the game and its source disagree: the
 * expected behavior is an `it.fails`, with a passing companion that pins today's behavior. Findings are tabled in
 * docs/phase7-wave9-qa.md.
