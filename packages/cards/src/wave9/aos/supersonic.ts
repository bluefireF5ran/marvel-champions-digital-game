/**
 * Modular encounter set `supersonic` (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., a Thunderbolt set; docs/phase7-wave9.md sections 3.25,
 * 3.26, 3.34 and 3.35). Villainous, Victory 1, Hinder, Uses (4 missile counters), the attachments' hosts ("Attach to
 * MACH-IV. Otherwise, ...") and Blasters' +1 ATK box are data.
 *
 * **MACH-IV (50156)**: RRG 1.8 erratum (p. 69; docs/phase7-wave9.md section 1.14 item 4): the scan's "cannot make basic
 * defenses against MACH-IV's attacks" now reads "Each character without the Aerial trait cannot defend against
 * MACH-IV's attacks", so no such character (ally, identity, or one an ability would declare the defender) is a
 * legal defender; an Aerial one still is.
 *
 * **Blasters (50157)**: the attached enemy's attacks gain overkill and ranged (the star on its +1 ATK box). Hero
 * Response after you attack and damage the attached enemy: spend two energy resources to discard it.
 *
 * **Heat-Seeking Missiles (50158)**: Forced Response after the attached enemy attacks you: remove 1 missile counter
 * from here (the last one discards the card, Uses) and take 2 indirect damage.
 *
 * **Aerial Dogfight (50159)**: each Aerial character (an enemy or a player's) takes 2 less from each attack, unless
 * the attacking character is Aerial, the card whose ability makes the attack is Aerial ("the attack has the Aerial
 * trait": the RRG gives an attack no traits of its own, RRG 1.8 "Traits", p. 45), or the attack has ranged, printed
 * on the attacker or granted to the attack. Damage that is not an attack's is not reduced.
 *
 * **Supersonic (50160)**: reveals MACH-IV (found, or engaged with the revealing player when in play), who activates
 * against the revealing player; surge when nobody activated. Boost: an attack gains overkill and ranged.
 *
 * Cards (5):
 * - 50156 MACH-IV (minion)
 * - 50157 Blasters (attachment)
 * - 50158 Heat-Seeking Missiles (attachment)
 * - 50159 Aerial Dogfight (side_scheme)
 * - 50160 Supersonic (treachery)
