/**
 * Rules QA for the Thunderbolts scenario of the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. box (Citizen V 50129a/b, Apprehending Rogue
 * Agents 50130a/b, Justice, Like Lightning / Thunderbolt Backup 50131a/b, 50132 to 50138), the Thunderbolt minion sets
 * (`aos`: Gravitational Pull 50139 to 50142, Hard Sound 50143 to 50147, Pale Little Spider 50148 to 50151, Power of
 * the Atom 50152 to 50155, Supersonic 50156 to 50160, The Leaper 50161 to 50164; `bp`: Extreme Risk 51039 to 51042;
 * `silk`: Growing Strong 52035 to 52038) and the S.H.I.E.L.D. Executive Board (50181a to 50184c): the interactions
 * the module tests and the scenario games (`thunderbolts-scenario.test.ts`, `thunderbolts-new-sets-scenario.test.ts`)
 * do not assert, each tied to an RRG 1.8 entry (`mc_rulesreference_v18_compressed.pdf`), an FFG ruling by its date
 * heading (marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md), the box rulebook (MC50) or an owner answer
 * (docs/phase7-wave9.md section 4.1). A `FINDING` comment marks a case where the game and its source disagree: the
 * expected behavior is an `it.fails`, with a passing companion that pins today's behavior. Findings are tabled in
 * docs/phase7-wave9-qa.md.
