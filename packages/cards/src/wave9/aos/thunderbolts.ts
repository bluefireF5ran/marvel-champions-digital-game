/**
 * Wave 9 scripting module `aos/thunderbolts` (docs/phase7-wave9.md sections 2.5, 3.21 to 3.24; MC50 p. 15): the
 * Thunderbolts scenario, Citizen V, the main scheme, the Justice, Like Lightning environment and the set's cards.
 * `card-groups.ts` maps this module to the ids below; keep the two in step.
 *
 * **Setup (50130a).** The scenario builder sets 1 + 1[per_hero] modular sets aside whole (`setAsideModularSets`, from
 * the ten sets with an Elite, Thunderbolt minion). The Setup shuffles every one of them into the encounter deck, then
 * takes each Elite, Thunderbolt minion back out to the set-aside area (a shuffled-in set cannot leave its minion
 * behind: the engine shuffles whatever is still set aside) and reveals Justice, Like Lightning. Jolt is not Elite and
 * stays in the deck.
 *
 * **Justice, Like Lightning (50131a).** Each player reveals a random set-aside Thunderbolt minion (it engages them);
 * the remaining one is revealed too and held by the environment: it is in play, engaged with nobody (owner questions
 * 25 to 27 of the wave 9 spec: a held minion that leaves engagement is engaged like any other; "reveal and attach" is
 * a reveal, so its When Revealed resolves, Q26 = B; the minion is discarded undefeated if the environment leaves
 * play). The card names no player for that reveal, so the first player resolves it (RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 19):
 * "you" in the held minion's When Revealed is the first player, and a surge deals them a facedown card. It engages
 * nobody, so its quickstrike has no one to attack (RRG 1.8 "Quickstrike", p. 36). In expert mode each of them gets a
 * tough status card.
 *
 * **Thunderbolt Backup (50131b), the end-of-round swap.** "When the round ends" is the villain phase ending, after
 * step five has already passed the first player token, so "the first player chooses" among tied minions is the NEW
 * first player (MC50 p. 22 FAQ: ties, including no damage, are the first player's choice).
 *
 * **Citizen V (50129a/b).** The engine checks a stun or confuse status before "would activate", so a stunned or
 * confused Citizen V discards the status and the interrupt never runs: he does not heal (owner decision Q2 = A, MC50
 * p. 22). Step two is `gameStep enemyActivations`; Citizen V's Sword and Tap In activate him outside it, so he
 * activates normally.
 *
 * **Apprehending Rogue Agents 1B (50130b).** The "engages that player" response checks the attacked minion is still in
 * play: one the attack defeated is in the victory display and engages nobody.
 *
 * **Citizen V's Sword (50132).** The data's `attachesTo` is `{ namedCard, "Citizen V. He activates against you" }` (the
 * sentence's tail is in the name), so the card finds no host and is discarded when revealed until the content package
 * says `{ kind: "villain" }`; the tests run on the card with that one field corrected. Tap In (50138): the revealing
 * player breaks a tie for "the least damage" (the Backup's FAQ names the first player for 131B only).
 *
 * **Down but Not Out (50137).** The random Thunderbolt minion is revealed by the player who revealed the treachery, so
 * it enters play engaged with them like any revealed minion (RRG 1.8 "Reveal", p. 38, step 2), its When Revealed and
 * quickstrike included; it is not held by the environment. It comes back with no damage and takes placed damage
 * (not dealt: a tough status card stays) down to 5 remaining hit points, none if it has 5 or fewer. It leaves the
 * victory display, so Citizen V's count drops with it. "Then, remove this card from the game" happens in both cases
 * (owner decision Q29 = B, over RRG 1.8 "'Then'", p. 44; worth official clarification): with no Thunderbolt minion in
 * the display nothing is revealed, the treachery is still removed from the game, and, as printed ("If no minion
 * entered play this way, this card gains surge"), it gains surge: its player is dealt a facedown encounter card.
 *
 * Cards (10):
 * - 50129a Citizen V (villain)
 * - 50130a Apprehending Rogue Agents (main_scheme)
 * - 50131a Justice, Like Lightning (environment)
 * - 50132 Citizen V's Sword (attachment)
 * - 50133 Jolt (minion)
 * - 50134 Innocent Bystanders (obligation)
 * - 50135 The Coming Storm (side_scheme)
 * - 50136 Rumbling Thunder (side_scheme)
 * - 50137 Down but Not Out (treachery)
 * - 50138 Tap In (treachery)
