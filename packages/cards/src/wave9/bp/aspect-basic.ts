/**
 * Wave 9 scripting module `bp/aspect-basic` (docs/phase7-wave9.md section 8.4), (51014 to 51030, 51036 to 51038). `card-groups.ts` maps this module to the ids
 * below; keep the two in step.
 *
 * **51014.manifold-response**: the chosen player (any, the first of the two in the text being the controller's choice)
 * searches their own deck and discard pile for a player side scheme; the search is compulsory when one exists (owner
 * ruling), the card goes to that player's hand and their deck is shuffled.
 *
 * **51015.infiltration-action**: the number and the discard are before the arrow, so they are the cost
 * (`discardChosenFromEncounterDeckCost`, docs/phase7-wave9.md section 3.43 (a)). The player may choose more than the
 * deck holds: the deck's cards are discarded, the deck is reset with an acceleration token and the cost is paid (RRG
 * 1.8 "Encounter Deck", p. 17), and "for each card discarded this way" counts the cards that were discarded. The
 * threat is one thwart of that size against one scheme, as Legal Practice 01023's same sentence is. "Put 1 minion
 * discarded this way into play" is mandatory when a minion was discarded, the player choosing among several; the
 * minion is taken from where it is, the new deck included when the discard emptied the old one (as Hammer Throw's
 * minion is; no ruling, reported as an open question).
 *
 * **51016.when-defeated**: "the defeating player" looks at, chooses and orders. A card is "scenario-specific" when it
 * belongs to the encounter set of the scenario's main scheme (RRG 1.8 "Scenario-Specific Card", p. 39); a card from the
 * victory display is out of the deck, the rest go back on the top and/or bottom in any order.
 *
 * **51017.show-of-empathy-forced-interrupt**: the threat being removed (`eventAmount`) lands as tokens on a non-Elite
 * minion chosen by the player who removed it, else by the scheme's controller. Then, once, if that minion's threat
 * is at least its remaining hit points, the scheme goes to the victory display and 1 set-aside Redemption attaches to
 * the minion. Redemption's own "take control ... Redeemed ally" text is 51036's constant.
 *
 * **51018.the-raft-response**: the tuck is printed before the arrow (a cost), and a cost that cannot be paid stops
 * the ability being initiated (RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 13). The engine has no tuck cost, so the trigger hears only a minion
 * that left play for the encounter discard pile (`eventIs: { to: "encounterDiscard" }`): one that went to the victory
 * display (Victory X), was removed from the game or was dealt to a player is not offered. The tuck is then the first
 * effect, and the rest stays guarded on the minion being tucked, for a minion an earlier response moved out of the
 * discard pile. Only then are threat removed (the tucked minion's printed SCH) and, at 4 or more tucked minions, 1
 * random one dealt facedown to a player the controller picks; that deal is heard by "when a player would be dealt an
 * encounter card" (docs/phase7-wave9.md section 3.45), and replaced, the minion stays tucked.
 *
 * **51019.invisibility-gear-interrupt**: the mirror of Ready for a Fight (52019); "would attack you" is replaced by
 * that enemy's scheme. **51020.sonic-rifle-action**: a reprint of Venom's 20015, aliased.
 *
 * **51021.sting-operation-response**: the minion is discarded, not defeated.
 *
 * **51022.aneka-response / 51022.aneka-special**: "another Dora Milaje ally" is any player's, resolved with Aneka's
 * controller as "you". The Special removes 1 threat from a scheme.
 *
 * **51023.ayo-response / 51024.okoye-response**: the same as Aneka's. **51023.ayo-special**: 1 damage to an enemy (not
 * an attack). **51024.okoye-special**: a Wakanda hero or ally, any player's, gets +1 THW and +1 ATK until the end of
 * the phase. Whoever controls the Special's ally chooses (the engine resolves a Special for its own card's controller).
 *
 * **51025.heart-of-the-panther-action**: the search is compulsory when a Black Panther upgrade is in the deck or discard
 * pile; the card is put into play (as an upgrade, on its controller's identity) and the deck shuffled; then up to 4
 * Black Panther upgrades the player controls, the new one too, are chosen and their Specials resolved in an order the
 * player picks. Team-Up and "Max 1 per deck" are data.
 *
 * **51026.when-defeated**: a reprint of 40027, aliased.
 *
 * **51030.dora-milaje-constant**: the whole printed cost is ignored while your identity has the Wakanda trait (a
 * reduction by the printed cost read from the hand, so an increase such as T'Challa's Shadow still applies).
 * **51030.dora-milaje-action**: the Special of 1 Dora Milaje ally, then heal 1 from that ally.
 *
 * **51036.redemption-constant**: Mind Control's rule (34009) with the Redeemed trait. The controller of Redemption is the
 * controller of the minion.
 *
 * **51037.white-wolf-forced-response**: after White Wolf attacks, 1 threat on the main scheme.
 *
 * **51038.target-spotter-interrupt**: when a minion would engage any player, the minion cannot activate until the end
 * of the phase, and engages the player who used the card instead (RRG 1.8 FAQ "Target Spotter (#38)", p. 65).
 *
 * Cards (20):
 * - 51014 Manifold (ally)
 * - 51015 Infiltration (event)
 * - 51016 Going Undercover (player_side_scheme)
 * - 51017 Show of Empathy (player_side_scheme)
 * - 51018 The Raft (support)
 * - 51019 Invisibility Gear (upgrade)
 * - 51020 Sonic Rifle (upgrade)
 * - 51021 Sting Operation (upgrade)
 * - 51022 Aneka (ally)
 * - 51023 Ayo (ally)
 * - 51024 Okoye (ally)
 * - 51025 Heart of the Panther (event)
 * - 51026 Build Support (player_side_scheme)
 * - 51027 Energy (resource)
 * - 51028 Genius (resource)
 * - 51029 Strength (resource)
 * - 51030 Dora Milaje (support)
 * - 51036 Redemption (upgrade)
