/**
 * Wave 9 definition-of-done 4b, pieces 1 to 3 (docs/wave-definition-of-done.md, docs/custom-deck-testing.md "The
 * pieces") for the six new heroes: Maria Hill and Nick Fury (`aos`), Black Panther / Shuri (`bp`), Silk, Falcon and
 * Winter Soldier. Piece 4 (a real MarvelCDB decklist per hero) is in `custom-decks-marvelcdb.test.ts`.
 *
 * 1. Cards in another hero's deck: every scripted new aspect and basic player card of `aos`, `bp`, `silk`, `falcon` and
 *    `winter` (`aspect-basic` modules; `aos/shield` is the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trooper encounter set, no player card; `tt` is
 *    unscripted) is played through the engine from a Core hero's deck, so a script that assumes its precon hero fails.
 *    A card with no ability (a plain resource) has nothing to script and is skipped; a card the Core hero cannot play
 *    by its own printed text ("Play only if your identity has ...") is asserted refused, and played once the Core
 *    identity carries the trait (the card pool is edited, never the rules).
 * 2. The wave's deckbuilding rules (see the comments in "wave 9 deckbuilding rules" for what each identity prints).
 * 3. The deck builder's start state: `requiredIdentitySet` is exactly each hero's signature cards (RRG 1.8 Appendix I
 *    "Deck Customization", p. 50).
 *
 * Decks are validated against `PLAYABLE_CARDS` (it holds every wave, wave 9 included).
