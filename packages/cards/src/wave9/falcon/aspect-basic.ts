/**
 * Wave 9 scripting module `falcon/aspect-basic` (docs/phase7-wave9.md section 8.4): 53014 to 53028 and 53034 to 53037.
 * `card-groups.ts` maps this module to the ids below; keep the two in step.
 *
 * **53014.adam-warlock-response / 53016.cloud-9-action**: reprints of Adam Warlock 17011 (`stld`) and Cloud 9 29014
 * (`ironheart`), same cost, stats, traits and text; aliased. 17011's other four refs are an ingestion artifact of the
 * bulleted lines (`partOf` the response); 53014's data lists only the response.
 *
 * **53015.aero-action**: Cloud 9's text with ATK. Exhausting Aero is the cost (before the arrow); the player is chosen
 * on resolution, and every Aerial character that player controls (allies, and an identity with the trait) gets +1 ATK
 * until the end of the phase.
 *
 * **53017.hugin-and-munin-response**: the search of the top 10 cards of the encounter deck is compulsory when a minion
 * is there (owner ruling: a search with no "may"); the minion enters play engaged with you, then one character you
 * control is readied for each icon (star and boost) printed in its boost area (section 3.43: `boostIcons + starIcons`;
 * amplify adds nothing). The search and the entry are "before the arrow", so they are costs by the rules, but the cost
 * vocabulary has no search of the encounter deck (`chooseCard` reads the payer's hand, discard and decks only), so they
 * are the first effects: with no minion in the top 10 the response is still offered and does nothing, instead of not
 * being offered. Each readied character is its own choice (RRG "'For Each'", p. 20), so one may be named twice.
 *
 * **53018.spectrum-response / 53018.spectrum-granted-response**: the data keeps one ref for the whole text, which
 * is two things: the response that tucks, and the bonuses, which last "only … while a card remains tucked under her"
 * (ruling June 2, 2026 - Ruling 2 (2)) and so are a constant read from the tucked card, not a lasting effect of the
 * response (section 3.46 (b)). The printed ref is that constant, and it gives her the response under the registry-only
 * id `SPECTRUM_GRANTED_RESPONSE` (`gainsAbility`, as Flight Squadron's), with no condition: she always has it. The
 * response answers her own play only ("After you play Spectrum": put into play another way she tucks nothing) and is
 * offered when a card paid for her (engine slot `paid.cards`: cards discarded from a hand, another player's too, or
 * spent from under a Resource Reserve; never a resource a "Resource" ability generated, never an overpaid card). The
 * player picks 1 of those still in a discard pile, whoever owns it; it is tucked faceup and stays its owner's. Each
 * bonus reads the printed resources of what is tucked under her: [mental] +2 THW, [physical] +2 ATK, [energy] +2 hit
 * points, each once however many icons, and a printed [wild] gives all three. A card of any type can be tucked (the
 * ruling's example is Captain America's Shield, a [wild]). When the tucked card leaves, the bonuses end at once; with
 * the hit points gone, damage of 3 or more defeats her.
 *
 * **53020.flight-squadron-constant / 53020.flight-squadron-granted-response**: "If each of your allies has the Aerial
 * trait, increase your ally limit by 1 and this card gains: 'Response: ...'". One condition (no ally you control
 * lacks the trait; true with no allies) over both halves of the constant: the ally limit (+1), and the grant of the
 * quoted response to the card itself (`gainsAbility`; RRG 1.8 "'Gains'", p. 21). The response is registered under the
 * registry-only id `FLIGHT_SQUADRON_GRANTED_RESPONSE`, as Night Vision Goggles 50070 registers its granted
 * Preparation (the data keeps one ref per constant, packages/content/src/data/wave9.test.ts), and carries no
 * condition of its own: while the constant's holds the card has it, with its cost (exhaust this card) its own.
 *
 * **53021.resource-reserve-constant / 53021.resource-reserve-action**: "Any player may spend the resource card tucked
 * here as if it were in their hand" is the engine rule `spendableFromTucked` (section 3.46 (c)): the tucked resource
 * card is offered to every player with their hand cards, generates what it would from the spender's hand (a wild is a
 * wild; The Power of Flight 53028 doubles for an Aerial card), counts as a card that paid, and is discarded from under
 * the support to its owner's discard pile. Only spending: it is not a card in hand for a discard cost and cannot be
 * played. The Action (any form, the controller's) exhausts the support as its cost and tucks 1 card of the resource
 * card type from the controller's hand (RRG 1.8 "Resource Card", p. 37: a card type, not any card with a resource
 * icon); "(to a maximum of 1)" refuses the action while a card is tucked. "Max 1 per player" is data. When the support
 * leaves play the card under it is discarded (RRG 1.8 "Tuck", p. 45).
 *
 * **53022.the-triskelion-constant / 53028.the-power-of-flight-constant**: reprints of Core's The Triskelion 01073 and
 * Angel's The Power of Flight 42022, same cost, icons, traits and text; aliased.
 *
 * **53023.captain-america-constant / 53023.captain-america-action**: "Play only if you are the Bucky Barnes or Sam
 * Wilson player" names an identity card by both sides ("Falcon/Sam Wilson", "Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes"; RRG 1.8
 * "Identity", p. 23), so it holds in either form. The Hero Action's cost is exhausting the upgrade and spending a
 * [physical] resource. The find offers every "Captain America's Shield" it reaches (RRG 1.8 "Find", p. 19: the linked
 * 53034 set aside, and with Steve Rogers in the game his 03009, ruling June 25, 2026 - Ruling 4 (2)); the player picks
 * and must pick one. The shield goes to the player's hand and stays its owner's (ruling June 25, 2026 - Ruling 1: "If
 * discarded, it returns to Steve's discard pile"); the linked copy, owned by nobody, becomes the player's. "If it
 * leaves play this way" is true only for a shield that was in play, then 4 damage to an enemy of the player's choice.
 * Not done: the owner's deck is not shuffled when the chosen shield was in it (a find of a deck card shuffles that
 * deck, RRG 1.8 "Search", p. 39); the choice among copies is made apart from `findCard`, which takes the first.
 *
 * **53024.wingman-interrupt**: another Aerial ally's consequential damage, 1 of it prevented; the cost exhausts the
 * attached ally (it cannot pay while exhausted).
 *
 * **53034.captain-americas-shield-constant**: Core's shield (03009) for "your hero": +1 DEF and retaliate 1 while the
 * controller is in hero form. Linked and Restricted are data.
 *
 * **53035.winter-soldier-response**: "attacks and defeats an enemy", 2 threat from a scheme of the player's choice.
 *
 * **53036.misty-knight-interrupt**: looks at the top 2 cards of the encounter deck and discards 1 (compulsory); the
 * thwart then removes 1 additional threat per icon (star and boost) printed in the discarded card's boost area
 * (`modifyThwart`, as Silk's Outwit 52010 reads "gets +X THW for this thwart"). The look and the discard follow no
 * arrow, so they are effects. Not tested, no ruling read: an encounter deck of fewer than 2 cards (the look takes the
 * cards there; the deck is not reset first).
 *
 * **53037.ops-room-interrupt**: "while defending" is the defender of the attack being the character that takes the
 * damage (`attackInProgress.defender` against the event's target), so overkill spilling onto another character of a
 * defended attack and an undefended attack are not answered. Removing the counter is the cost; the threat removal is a
 * plain removal (not a thwart) from a scheme of the player's choice.
 *
 * **53019.strength-in-diversity-action**: "for each different Trait on friendly characters in play" is the number of
 * distinct traits among the identity and allies in play (`distinctTraitsOf`, section 3.48); one choice per trait. The
 * choices are made one after another, each re-reading the board.
 *
 * Nothing is skipped.
 *
 * Cards (19):
 * - 53014 Adam Warlock (ally)
 * - 53015 Aero (ally)
 * - 53016 Cloud 9 (ally)
 * - 53017 Hugin & Munin (ally)
