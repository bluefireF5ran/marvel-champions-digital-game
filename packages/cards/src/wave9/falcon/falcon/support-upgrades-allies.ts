/**
 * Wave 9 scripting module `falcon/falcon/support-upgrades-allies` (docs/phase7-wave9.md section 8.4). Not started: the registry is empty and nothing is
 * skipped. `card-groups.ts` maps this module to the ids below; keep the two in step.
 *
 *
 * **53002.redwing-action** (Hero Action): "Exhaust Redwing, return him to your hand, and discard the top card of the
 * encounter deck -> choose to either deal X damage to an enemy or remove X threat from a scheme. X is the number of
 * icons (star and boost) in the discarded card's boost area." All three costs are paid together before the choice; the
 * top card is bound as `top`, X is `boostIcons + starIcons` (amplify adds nothing). RRG 1.8 FAQ "Redwing (#2)", p. 65,
 * and ruling January 26, 2026 - Ruling 6 (1): while the top card is faceup and prints no icon the ability cannot be
 * initiated (`while: not(topOfEncounterDeckShowsNoIcons)`); a facedown top card cannot be seen, so the ability is
 * offered and resolves for whatever the card prints, 0 included (ruling March 19, 2026 - Ruling 5). The damage and the
 * threat removal are not an attack or a thwart.
 * DEVIATION: the engine refuses one card paying two parts of a cost (exhausted and also returned), so the exhaust is
 * scripted as the condition that Redwing is ready (`while`), and only the return and the discard are the cost. The
 * outcome is the same: he must be ready, and a card back in hand is no longer exhausted. See the report.
 *
 * **53006.falcons-flock-resource** (Resource): "Remove 1 bird counter from here -> generate a [energy] resource for an
 * Aerial card. (Limit once per card.)" Uses (5 bird counters) and the discard on the last counter are the keyword's.
 * `oncePerPaidCard`: one use for each card being paid for (owner question 36, built as A: each payment counts on its
 * own); `repeatable` lets the other uses on one payment come from other copies' counters, one per card.
 *
 * **53007.soup-kitchen-action** (Alter-Ego Action): "Exhaust Sam Wilson and Soup Kitchen -> heal damage from Sam
 * Wilson equal to his REC and reduce the cost of the next ally or support played this phase by 2." Both exhausts are
 * the cost; the healing is Sam Wilson's REC as it stands.
 *
 * **53008.aerial-evacuation-interrupt** (Hero Interrupt): "When another friendly character would be dealt any amount
 * of damage, discard Aerial Evacuation -> prevent all of that damage and change to alter-ego form. If that character
 * is a hero, they also change to alter-ego form." "Another" is a character other than Falcon's identity. Rulings
 * December 17, 2025 - Ruling 1 (2), March 6, 2026 - Ruling 1 and July 9, 2026 - Ruling 2: it prevents damage taken;
 * the damage is still considered dealt. The change is an effect, so it does not use the voluntary form change of the
 * round (rules insert); either change is skipped for a player who cannot change form.
 *
 * **53009.aerial-recon-action** (Hero Action): "Exhaust Aerial Recon and deal a player 1 facedown encounter card ->
 * place 1 recon counter here." Both parts are the cost. "A player" is any player still in the game, Falcon's own
 * included, picked as the action is initiated (`dealEncounterCardsToChosenPlayerCost`; forced in a one-player game).
 * The card waits facedown in front of that player and is revealed in step four of the next villain phase (RRG 1.8
 * "Deal, Deal an Encounter Card", p. 15). A deal paid as a cost is not announced to "would be dealt" interrupts (every
 * cost is paid at once, RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 13), so the card's own interrupt does not answer its own action.
 *
 * **53009.aerial-recon-interrupt** (Interrupt): "When a player would be dealt an encounter card, remove 1 recon counter
 * from here instead." Works in either form (not a Hero Interrupt); not offered at 0 counters; the card replaced stays on
 * the deck and nothing is dealt.
 *
 * **53010.battlefield-awareness-interrupt** (Hero Interrupt): "When Falcon uses a basic power, exhaust Battlefield
 * Awareness and discard the top card of the encounter deck -> Falcon gets +1 to that power for this use for each icon
 * (star and boost) in the discarded card's boost area." Same refusal as Redwing for a faceup top card with no icon.
 *
 * **53011.draw-their-fire-response** (Hero Response): "After the villain phase begins, discard Draw Their Fire ->
 * Falcon does not exhaust to defend until the end of the phase." The printed text names Falcon, read as your hero.
 *
 * **53012.talon-line-response** (Hero Response): "After you resolve Falcon's 'Eagle-Eyed' ability, discard Talon Line
 * -> for each icon in the discarded card's boost area, choose 1: ready a character you control, or stun an enemy." The
 * card is Eagle-Eyed's `discarded` slot read where it is now (owner question 35 = A: a card Serpent Solutions dealt
 * away is no longer counted by Eagle-Eyed itself, but Talon Line still reads its printed icons). Not offered when the
 * card shows 0 icons (the FAQ reasoning of Redwing; flagged in the spec, 4.2).
 *
 * **53013.vibranium-microweave-constant / -interrupt**: "Falcon gets +1 DEF." and "Hero Interrupt: When Falcon would
 * take any amount of damage, exhaust Vibranium Microweave -> prevent 1 of that damage and deal 1 damage to an enemy."
 *
 * Cards (9):
 * - 53002 Redwing (ally)
 * - 53006 Falcon's Flock (support)
 * - 53007 Soup Kitchen (support)
 * - 53008 Aerial Evacuation (upgrade)
 * - 53009 Aerial Recon (upgrade)
 * - 53010 Battlefield Awareness (upgrade)
 * - 53011 Draw Their Fire (upgrade)
 * - 53012 Talon Line (upgrade)
