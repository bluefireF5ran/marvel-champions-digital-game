/**
 * Rules QA, "can each wave 9 scenario be won": M.O.D.O.K. (MC50 p. 13; 50103a to 50113), standard mode, four players.
 *
 * No honest win was found. SEARCH (offline, not re-run here): 70 games at 1 to 4 players (the same pool, seeds 1 and
 * 2): 0 wins. 28 were lost to the third scheme completion, 38 to every hero defeated; M.O.D.O.K. took at most 12
 * damage and no Holding Cell was ever emptied. Every game was played from the printed setup with the natural shuffle
 * by the purposeful player of `qa-wins.shared.ts` (the Alert Level's sink is not in this scenario; the Holding Cell
 * Hero Actions are left to the greedy driver, which pays for them whenever it can).
 *
 * Where the games end, and why (the pinned line: Captain Marvel, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, seed 1): the scheme is 1
 * per hero to 7 per hero (4 of 28) with +1 per hero each round, and "when this stage would be completed" it puts a
 * random set-aside Adaptoid upgrade into play instead, clears the threat and shuffles the Adaptoid minions back into
 * the encounter deck, and the players lose when no upgrade is left to put into play (50104b scan; 4 upgrades, 1 in
 * play at setup, so the THIRD completion loses). Each upgrade also buffs every Adaptoid (50109 to 50112). The table
 * cleared threat in rounds 1 to 7 as 0, 2, 7, 3, 2, 0, 1 and the villain phases put on 4, 14, 8, 19, 22, 24 and 8:
 * completions in rounds 4 and 5 (31 and 30 removed) and the loss at the third. M.O.D.O.K. (10 hit points, retaliate 1,
 * 50103a) was defeated once (-2 lock counters) and the Holding Cell's 8 lock counters (2 per hero) were never close to
 * gone: the win is "free the Inhumans, then defeat M.O.D.O.K. with no Holding Cell in play". Every printed number
 * matches the scan (qa-wins-clock.qa.test.ts).
