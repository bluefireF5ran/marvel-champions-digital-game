/**
 * Issue #285: on a phone, once the villain's attack had resolved, "happening now" drew the boost card over the damage
 * breakdown and cut the total off: the headline wrapped to two lines and the panel's fixed height had no room left.
 * Played from the `?screen=villain-boost-interrupt` jump (Scarlet Witch against Rhino, paused on Chaos Control's
 * boost-count window), answered with RESOLVE so the attack resolves: seed 1 counts Crowd Control, a side scheme drawn
 * on its side, and seed 4 counts "I'm Tough!", the card in the report, a portrait card. The screen is the reporter's:
 * the report's screenshot is 1080×2520 pixels, an Android phone at 3× (360×840 CSS pixels, where the headline wraps).
 * Phone only: the desktop rail lays out "happening now" on its own, taller body.
