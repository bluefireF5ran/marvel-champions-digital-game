 * The guided-mode e2e suite (`docs/guided-mode.md` §4 G11): a small, fast, deterministic regression net so the
 * tutorial flow can't silently break. It runs against this package's own **Vite dev server**, never a production
 * build — `scenes/boot.ts`'s `?screen=` dev jumps (used by the Hold on! and tips fixtures) are gated on
 * `import.meta.env.DEV`, so a `vite preview`/built bundle wouldn't have them.
 *
 * A fixed, distinct port (5193) plus `reuseExistingServer: false` in CI: other agents/sessions routinely run their
 * own dev servers on other ports (5183 and friends — see `docs/guided-mode.md` §6), so this must never attach to
 * someone else's server, locally or in CI.
