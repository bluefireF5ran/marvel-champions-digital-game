/**
 * Which picture belongs to which face, as a pure function.
 *
 * A card is not always one image: a hero identity has two faces, a villain has
 * a picture per stage, and a main scheme has an A and a B side per stage. The
 * content schema puts the reference on whichever of those is its own printed
 * card, so this module is the one place that knows how to ask.
 *
 * Two kinds of reference, in the order the content package says to prefer them
 * (`schema/ids.ts`): a card's `ArtRef` wins, and its `ImageRef` (the path the
 * source publishes the scan under) is the fallback. Both resolve to the same
 * place: a file under the repo's `assets/card-art/`, served from this app's own
 * origin at `/card-art/<path>`. Same-origin matters because WebGL will not take
 * a cross-origin image as a texture.
 *
 * The scans are a **build input**, never fetched at runtime. The content
 * scripts put them in `assets/card-art/`; `vite-card-art.ts` serves that folder
 * in dev and copies the pool's share of it into `dist/card-art/` at build, so a
 * web deploy and both native shells (Tauri and Capacitor wrap the same `dist/`)
 * load art as plain static files. `allArtFor` below is what decides which files
 * that is, so the bundle and the loader cannot disagree.
 *
 * Nothing here loads anything: it returns a URL and a stable texture key, so it
 * is testable without a canvas and without the network.
