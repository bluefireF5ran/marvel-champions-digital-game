/**
 * Which scans a build has to carry: every picture any card in the pool can ask
 * for, plus the three card backs and the stand-in pictures (`StandIn`).
 *
 * Pure, so it is tested here and merely *used* by `vite-card-art.ts`. It is the
 * pool's share of `assets/card-art/`, not the whole folder, for two reasons:
 * the folder holds every card MarvelCDB publishes (thousands the app cannot
 * draw), and Tauri embeds the whole of `dist/` into the desktop binary, so
 * every needless scan is paid for at compile time and again at launch. As packs
 * join the pool their scans join the bundle, with no list to maintain.
