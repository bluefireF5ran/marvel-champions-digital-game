/**
 * Campaign story-panel artwork, found by convention in the repo's `art/` folder (see `art/README.md`):
 *
 *   art/campaigns/<campaignId>/artboards/<name>.<ext>
 *   art/campaigns/<campaignId>/cover.<ext>
 *
 * A story file names a panel's picture by `<name>` (`{ kind: "artboard", name: "mountain-facility", … }` in
 * `campaign/stories/*.ts`), so dropping a file in with that name is all it takes to replace the panel's
 * "Panel art: …" placeholder. Variants work as they do for villains: `mountain-facility.webp`,
 * `mountain-facility-2.jpg`, one picked at random.
 *
 * `cover.<ext>` is a box's own key art for the Cover screen — `art/README.md` marked it "NOT READ YET" until this
 * module started reading it; a box with no cover file simply has none (`campaignCoverFor` returns null), so the
 * Cover screen's existing villain-art/placeholder fallback is unaffected.
 *
 * `rulebook/page_NNN.jpg` (docs/phase7-wave5-handoff.md "Scenario intros from the rulebook art") is one of the box's
 * own official rulebook pages that is all art (the cover, an already-lettered comic page). The Extras rulebook reader
 * (`scenes/extras-reader.ts`) shows it where the book's text conversion has none (issue #446), and a one-off
 * (non-campaign) game's scenario intro (`campaign/scenario-intros.ts`) shows it instead of new art, since the page is
 * already the villain's own reveal beat. Every box's folder is read; the glob only resolves URLs, so a page is
 * fetched the first time a screen draws it.
 *
 * Pure over a path → URL map, like `hero-art.ts`, so it is tested without the glob.
