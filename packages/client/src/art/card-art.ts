/**
 * Loading and drawing card scans.
 *
 * Art is fetched **lazily, per card, as the table asks for it** rather than in
 * one per-scenario batch. A Core scenario touches a few hundred cards, and a
 * preload of all of them would put a progress bar in front of a game that only
 * ever shows a dozen at once. The board draws its frame immediately, the scan
 * arrives, and the board redraws — which is also the honest behavior when a
 * scan is missing, since the generated frame is the designed fallback for that
 * (PLAN.md Phase 4, "a missing scan falls back to a generated frame").
 *
 * A failed load is remembered as missing so a 404 is asked for exactly once.
 *
 * Nothing ever evicted a loaded texture until this cap was added. A scan
 * decodes to `width * height * 4` bytes on the GPU/CPU regardless of its
 * compressed size on disk, most Core scans decode to 2-3 MB and a few (a
 * villain's landscape stage art) run past 8 MB, and a long game — or several
 * games back to back in the one tab this app never reloads (`main.ts` builds
 * exactly one `Phaser.Game`) — touches far more than a table's worth of them:
 * every side scheme cycled through, every discard pile browsed, every
 * encounter card that ever left the deck. Left unbounded that is an
 * unrecoverable multi-gigabyte climb for the life of the tab; a player
 * reported the browser crashing at 3.5 GB. `RESIDENT_BUDGET_BYTES` below is
 * the fix: a soft cap on decoded bytes resident at once, enforced by evicting
 * the least-recently-*requested* textures (not "least recently drawn" —
 * `request()` runs on every redraw for every card a scene currently wants to
 * show, so anything still on screen is always the newest tick and is always
 * the last thing evicted).
