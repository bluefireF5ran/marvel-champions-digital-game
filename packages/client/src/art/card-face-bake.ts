/**
 * Bakes a `CardFaceSpec` (`card-face.ts`) into an `ImageBitmap`: fetches and decodes the art, downscaled to the size
 * the card shows it at, and paints the face over it. The same code runs inside `card-face.worker.ts` and, where a
 * worker can't (no `OffscreenCanvas`, or no fonts in workers — older WebKit), on the main thread
 * (`card-face-baker.ts`'s inline fallback). Either way the decode itself is `createImageBitmap`'s, which browsers
 * do off the main thread.
 *
 * Decoded art is kept in a small LRU (`ArtBitmaps`), keyed by URL and decode size, so re-baking a card for a new
 * state (selected, seated, dimmed) doesn't fetch and decode its art again.
