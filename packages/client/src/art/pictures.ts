/**
 * Full-bleed pictures from the repo's `art/` folder — title wallpapers,
 * villain artwork, end-of-game scenes — as opposed to card scans
 * (`art-source.ts`). What they share lives here: what a picture is, how one is
 * picked from several, and how one is fitted to a panel.
 *
 * Every folder under `art/` is globbed at build time (`title-art.ts`,
 * `scenario-art.ts`), so adding a file is all it takes to add a picture. Vite
 * emits each as a hashed asset; same origin in dev and in every packaged
 * shell, which WebGL needs to accept it as a texture.
 *
 * `ensurePictureLoaded` below takes a live `Phaser.Scene`, but only as a
 * *type* (`art/card-art.ts`'s own doc comment explains why: the real
 * `phaser` package throws on import outside a browser, so a runtime import
 * here would make this otherwise-pure, otherwise-testable module need a DOM
 * shim for one function).

/**
 * Ensures `picture` is loaded into `scene`'s texture manager, kicking off the load (once) if it isn't yet.
 * Returns its texture key when it's ready to draw, else `null` — the same "draw the frame now, redraw when the
 * scan arrives" contract `art/card-art.ts`'s `CardArt.request` uses, generalized to a full-bleed picture rather
 * than a card scan (which has its own cache keyed by card, not by this module's one-off pictures). Factored out
 * of `scenes/game-over.ts`'s own `#drawOutcomeArt`, which every later caller (the pack-shelf roster, W2b) would
 * otherwise have had to reinvent field for field.
 *
 * `onReady` fires once, the first time this exact picture finishes loading, if `scene` is still active then — a
 * caller redraws from it.
 *
 * **One load per texture manager, not per scene, and not through a scene's loader.** Textures live on the game, so
 * two scenes asking for the same picture at once (Title and the guide chooser share a wallpaper; a Board overlay and
 * its parent share a cover) must not both load it: the second logs "Texture key already in use" and, in the e2e
 * suite, fails the run. A scene's own loader is the wrong tool: when the scene shuts down mid-load the loader is reset,
 * but its in-flight file still completes and adds the texture, so a scene that then asked again (a restart, the next
 * screen) added it a second time. So the picture is fetched with a plain `Image` that outlives every scene, the
 * request stays registered until that image settles, and the texture is added once, guarded by `exists`. Waiters
 * (every scene that asked meanwhile) get their own `onReady` if still active; a file that fails to load is forgotten,
 * so a later request tries again.
