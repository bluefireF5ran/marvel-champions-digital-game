/**
 * Team-Up pictures, found by convention in the repo's `art/` folder (see `art/README.md`):
 *
 *   art/teamups/<pair-slug>/splash.<ext>   the full picture, shown once when the Team-Up first becomes active
 *   art/teamups/<pair-slug>/badge.<ext>    the closeup, shown in a circle on the Board while it is active
 *
 * `<pair-slug>` is the two names a `teamUp` keyword carries, each lowercased and reduced to letters and digits,
 * sorted and joined with `-` (`["Rogue", "Gambit"]` and `["Gambit", "Rogue"]` are both `gambit-rogue`), so there is no
 * table mapping pairs to files: the folder name *is* the lookup. A pair with neither picture simply has no splash and
 * no badge; there is no placeholder. A folder whose name starts with `_` is a holding area and is never read.
 *
 * The parsing and the lookup are pure functions over a path → URL map, so they are tested without the glob.
