/**
 * Background music playback and transition management.
 *
 * Runs as a persistent, non-rendering Phaser Scene (`MusicScene`, registered with
 * `SCENES.music`) so its loader, tweens, and sound instances are never destroyed
 * by scene transitions (`Title` → `ScenarioSelect` → `Board` → `GameOver`).
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *  - Lazy-loading audio tracks on demand into `game.cache.audio`.
 *  - Looping playback with smooth cross-fades between tracks.
 *  - Browser autoplay policy handling (Phaser WebAudioSoundManager queues sound until unlocked).
 *  - Syncing mute state with `settings.sound`.
 *  - Shuffling the songs earned in Extras (#191, `settings.musicShuffle` or the music player's Shuffle), one after
 *    another, in place of each screen's own music; and telling the music button when a song starts.
