/**
 * The campaign loop as the client drives it: one object that owns "where is this campaign kept" and "which runner
 * call comes next", so no scene has to get the order of `resolveBetweenGames` → `startGameFromLog` → play →
 * `campaignResultOf` → `applyCampaignResult` right by hand (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §7).
 *
 * Plain TypeScript over a `CampaignStorage` and the engine's own runner — no Phaser — so the whole loop is tested
 * with Vitest against the real MC10 definition.
 *
 * **Nothing half-answered is ever written.** The runner asks one choice at a time and re-runs from the top on every
 * answer (runner.ts's "re-entry is re-running"), so a pending result is returned to the caller with the record
 * untouched, and only a `done` result is persisted. Reloading the page mid-choice therefore asks the same
 * question again with the same options, and a `random` op cannot be rerolled by refreshing.
