/**
 * Intros for one-off scenarios: a single picture read beat by beat before the deal, the way a campaign issue opens
 * on its comic page. A scenario with no campaign of its own gets the same "here's the fight" moment without a run
 * behind it.
 *
 * Two sources for that picture (`ScenarioIntroArt`):
 * - `{ kind: "scenario" }` — a one-off artboard drawn for this scenario (`art/scenarios/<scenarioId>/intro.<ext>`,
 *   `art/scenario-art.ts`'s `introArtFor`), lettered by the comic reader itself (Rhino, Sabretooth).
 * - `{ kind: "rulebook", campaignId, page }` — the box's own official rulebook comic page
 *   (`art/campaigns/<campaignId>/rulebook/page_NNN.jpg`, `art/campaign-art.ts`'s `campaignRulebookPageFor`),
 *   already lettered (captions and speech balloons are printed into it), so its beats carry no lines of our own —
 *   camera pans/zooms over the box's own page instead of new art (docs/phase7-wave5-handoff.md "Scenario intros
 *   from the rulebook art"). `rulebookIntro` below is the builder for this.
 *
 * **Flavor only**, like `story.ts`: nothing here is a rule, and a scenario with no intro (or no art for it) simply
 * goes straight to the deal. Hero lines use `StoryLine.fallback` the same way campaign lines do, so a table without
 * that hero still gets the beat as narration.
