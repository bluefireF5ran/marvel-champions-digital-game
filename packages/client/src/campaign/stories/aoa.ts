/**
 * Age of Apocalypse (MC45) told through its own eight lettered rulebook comic pages. Like Mutant Genesis
 * (`./mut_gen.ts`) and The Rise of Red Skull, the box's official pages are the story: captions and speech balloons are
 * printed into the art, so the eight pages are copied byte-for-byte from `art/campaigns/aoa/rulebook/page_NNN.jpg`
 * into `art/campaigns/aoa/pages/NN-<slug>.jpg` (the folder the comic reader reads) and every `ComicPage` below is
 * `lettered: true`: no beat carries a line of ours, so nothing is lettered over printed balloons. The `rulebook/`
 * folder stays the source of record (`art/README.md`). Everything else in this file (blurbs, briefings, taunts, the
 * finale's copy, the plain-words call copy) is original flavor for this app; no rule lives here (see `../story.ts`).
 *
 * **Cast:** Bishop (`45001a`) and Magik (`45030a`) ship in this box, so their lines are written for them; every other
 * hero shows the narrator `fallback` instead.
 *
 * **Page → issue mapping** (rulebook page → file → where it plays): p. 7 `01-institute` is the page right before
 * Scenario 1's Setup (Unus); p. 9 `02-infinites` is Unus's aftermath (the Infinites, the rescue and the Resistance);
 * p. 10 `03-horsemen` is the opener of Scenario 2 (Four Horsemen); p. 13 `04-citadel` is Scenario 2's aftermath (the
 * Horsemen are down) and the opener of Scenario 3 (Apocalypse); p. 15 `05-dark-beast` opens Scenario 4 (Dark Beast)
 * and its first panel is Apocalypse's aftermath; p. 17 `06-cairo` and p. 18 `07-pyramid` open Scenario 5
 * (En Sabah Nur), the first panel of p. 17 doubling as Dark Beast's aftermath; p. 21 `08-home` is the finale's spread.
 *
 * **Panel rectangles** are measured by eye against each page's own 1800×1800 pixels, one rectangle per printed
 * panel in the rulebook's reading order (tiers top to bottom, left to right); bled panels (a full-width bottom
 * spread, a close-up spilling past its frame) are boxed to the panel they belong to.
 *
 * **Plain-words calls.** The between-games and in-game choices this box raises are worded here once
 * (`setupCalls`, `aftermathCalls`) so no prompt shows only the rulebook's sentence. A reward is not one of the 40
 * cards a deck needs and is one of the 50 it may hold, and Desperate Measures counts toward neither limit (owner
 * decisions, 2026-10-08; MC45 p. 24), which is why each note says so.
