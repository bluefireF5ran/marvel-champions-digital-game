/**
 * The Galaxy's Most Wanted (MC16) told through its six fan-made comic pages (`art/campaigns/gmw/pages/`,
 * credited to Joey Vazquez in `pages/CREDITS.md`) instead of single-picture panels — the box has
 * `art/README.md`'s "comic reader" art, so `pages` below is read by the reader, and `opener`/`aftermathArt` are
 * left as plain fallbacks for any screen not yet wired to it. Original flavor copy for this app; no rule lives
 * here (see `../story.ts`) — every mechanical word (Market prices, Collection contents, log values) comes from
 * `packages/cards/src/campaigns/gmw.ts` and the run's own log.
 *
 * Page → issue mapping (`docs/campaign-client-per-box.md` §4): #1 → 01-badoon, #2 and #3 split 02-museum's
 * panels between them, #4 → 03-nebula (04-knowhere is the scenario 4 aftermath page, wired when the Aftermath
 * screen gets its own comic pass), #5 → 05-ronan, the finale → 06-finale (wired with the Finale spread).

 * 1500×1500 for pages 1–4, 1920×993 for pages 5–6): a script thresholds each page for its near-white panel
 * borders against the dark/colored gutters, locates the border lines around each panel (row/column white-run
 * detection, and for slanted panels the largest connected border blob), and every candidate rectangle is
 * rendered as a crop and reviewed against the source page before being written down (crops kept, ungit-tracked,
 * under `artifacts/qa/gmw-reader/rects/`). A background panel that bleeds off the page with no printed border
 * (page 1's starfield, page 3's dogfight, page 5's Ronan close-up) is measured to the page's own edge. Slanted
 * panels (page 3's two insets) are boxed to the bounding rectangle of the tilted frame, not the frame itself.
 * `02-museum`'s middle panel is genuinely solid black in the source art (the alarm cutting the museum's
 * lights) with no readable content, so no beat points a panel at it; its alarm caption/sfx are carried on the
 * neighboring right-inset beat instead.
