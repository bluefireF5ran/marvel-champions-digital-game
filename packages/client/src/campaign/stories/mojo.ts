/**
 * MojoMania (MC39) told as a cancelled-then-renewed TV show: three issues, each an episode, with Mojo as the
 * showrunner who keeps picking the cast. The box is a scenario pack with no heroes of its own, so its default cast is
 * Gambit (`37001a`) and Rogue (`38001a`) from the same cycle; their lines are written for them and every other
 * hero shows the narrator `fallback` instead (`../story.ts`'s own rule). Original flavor for this app; no rule lives
 * here (see `../story.ts`): the genre-set picks, Longshot and the recorded cards all come from
 * `packages/cards/src/campaigns/mojo.ts` and the run's own log, and the "Handled for you" notes below only restate
 * what those setup instructions already do.
 *
 * **Art:** the insert has no story art, so the box is told through two lettered comic pages the owner supplied
 * (`art/campaigns/mojo/pages/`): `01-broadcast` (a two-page spread) opens issue #1 and `02-and-so-it-goes` is the
 * finale's page. Both are lettered, so the reader adds none of its own captions or bubbles; panel rectangles are
 * measured by eye against each file's own pixels. Issues #2 and #3 open on clean single pictures the owner picked
 * (`art/campaigns/mojo/artboards/`, `ComicPage.artboard`): the reader letters them with each beat's caption and
 * bubbles, at the spots measured below on the pictures' own pixels. The box's cover is `art/campaigns/mojo/cover.jpg`. Mojo and Spiral brief their own issues through `portraitScenarioId`, which borrows
 * each scenario's villain picture (`art/scenarios/<id>/villain.*`) for the round portrait.
 *
 * **Art to regenerate** (owner, when image credit allows; the long list with prompts is in
 * `docs/campaign-client-per-box.md`): `hallway` is a stand-in Marvel cover (1185x1800, not the corridor of doors);
 * `screens` and `mojo-looms` are found art that should match issue #2's generated style; the cover could too.
 * `longshot` is done (generated, 1672x941). A replacement keeps its artboard name and is 1672x941, so dropping the
 * file in is all it takes, but the beat rectangles and bubble placements of `hallway`, `screens` and `mojo-looms`
 * were measured on the found files and must be re-measured for a wide file (and `width`/`height` updated).
