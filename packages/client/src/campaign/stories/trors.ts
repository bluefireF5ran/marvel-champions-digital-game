/**
 * The Rise of Red Skull (MC10) told as five issues. Original flavor copy for this app — issues #1–#3 and the
 * finale follow `Marvel Champions game screens/Campaign - *.dc.html` word for word; #4 and #5 are written to match.
 * No rule lives here (see `../story.ts`).
 *
 * **Guided read over the box's own official pages.** Unlike GMW's unlettered fan pages, MC10's rulebook comic
 * (`docs/campaign-modes/mc10_the_rise_of_red_skull_rules_web.pdf`) is already lettered — captions and speech
 * balloons are printed into the art. Rather than teach the art pipeline a second "box's official pages get loaded
 * a different way" branch, the 8 pages are copied byte-for-byte from `art/campaigns/trors/rulebook/page_NNN.jpg`
 * into `art/campaigns/trors/pages/NN-<slug>.jpg` — the convention `art/campaign-art.ts`'s glob and the comic
 * reader already read for GMW — and every `ComicPage` below is marked `lettered: true` so the reader shows none of
 * its own captions/bubbles over them (`ui/comic-reader.ts`) and fits each panel into the frame instead of cropping
 * it to cover. The `rulebook/` folder stays as the source of record; the client never loads it directly
 * (`art/README.md`).
 *
 * **Page → issue mapping**, by story content: #1 (crossbones) → 01-siege plus 02-crossbones' first panel (her
 * takedown); #2 (absorbing-man) → the rest of 02-crossbones plus 03-absorbing-man's first panel; #3 (taskmaster) →
 * the rest of 03-absorbing-man, all of 04-hydra-tower, and 05-taskmaster's first panel; #4 (zola) → the rest of
 * 05-taskmaster plus 06-zola's first panel; #5 (red-skull) → the rest of 06-zola plus all of 07-red-skull.
 * 08-epilogue is the finale's own page — recorded here for the Finale screen's later comic pass, not wired to any
 * issue yet (`campaign/story.ts`'s `finale` block still carries the plain flavor text).
 *
 * **Panel rectangles** below are measured against each page's own pixel size (1800×1800 throughout): a script
 * (PIL/numpy) locates each page's black panel borders against the white gutters between them, every candidate
 * rectangle rendered as a numbered overlay and checked against the source page before being written down here
 * (kept, ungit-tracked, under `artifacts/qa/trors-reader/rects/`). Reading order follows each page's own tiers,
 * left to right, top to bottom, the way the rulebook itself reads — including panels that bleed to a page's own
 * edge with no printed border (04-hydra-tower's skyline strip) and an inset that breaks its neighbor's frame with
 * no border of its own (07-red-skull's foreground Hawkeye, boxed to the page's own edges the same way GMW's page 5
 * bleeds Ronan's close-up).
