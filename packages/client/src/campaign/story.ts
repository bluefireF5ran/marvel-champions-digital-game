/**
 * The comic a campaign is told as (`Marvel Champions game screens/Campaign - *.dc.html`): each scenario is an
 * *issue* with a title, an opener, lines for the villain's stage flips, a narrator for the aftermath and a finale.
 *
 * **Flavor only.** Nothing here is a rule: every mechanical word the screens show (what a TECH upgrade does, how many
 * delay counters were logged, what a loss costs) comes from the `CampaignDefinition`, the log and the card data.
 * A story that is missing a line never blocks play — every lookup here has a plain fallback.
 *
 * **Hero lines degrade to narration.** The box's own heroes get written dialogue ("these two ship in the box, so
 * their beats are written for them"); a line whose hero is not on the roster is shown as a narrator caption with
 * its `fallback` text instead, so any roster gets the same beats.
