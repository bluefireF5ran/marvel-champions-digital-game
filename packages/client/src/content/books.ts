/**
 * The rulebooks Extras can open: the Rules Reference, FFG's rulings since RRG 1.7, and every campaign box's
 * rulebook. Each reads as plain text from the repo's markdown conversion (`view/book-model.ts`), shows a rulebook's
 * all-art pages (its cover, its comic) as the box's own page pictures (`pageArtId`), and links out to the original
 * PDFs.
 *
 * **The markdown is loaded on demand.** It is ~900 KB across the files, so each is its own lazily imported chunk
 * (`?raw`), fetched the first time that book is opened, never at startup.
 *
 * **The PDFs are linked, not shipped.** They are ~170 MB in the repo (`docs/campaign-modes/`, the RRG at the root),
 * far too much for every web, desktop and mobile build to carry. A link opens the repo's own copy on GitHub, which
 * shows a PDF in the browser; `books.test.ts` fails if a link names a file the repo doesn't have.
