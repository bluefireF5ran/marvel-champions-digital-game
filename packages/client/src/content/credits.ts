/**
 * Everything the game shows or plays that somebody else made, and who made it (the Art & Credits screen,
 * `scenes/credits.ts`, drawn from `view/credits-model.ts`). The owner asked that every piece of art be credited
 * (2026-10-20), so a new art folder with a SOURCE.md or CREDITS.md note needs an entry here: `credits.test.ts`
 * fails when one is missing. `folders` are repo-relative paths (under `art/`, `assets/` or `music/`) that an entry
 * covers; a parent folder covers its children.
 *
 * Where the repo does not record an artist or a source, the credit line says so plainly rather than guessing; those
 * entries also carry `gap: true`, which is the owner's to-do list of credits to fill in.
