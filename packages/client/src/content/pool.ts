/**
 * The one card pool this app runs: Core, wave 1 and cycles 1 to 10's shipped-so-far packs (cycle 10: the Civil War box and the Wonder Man and Hercules packs)
 * (PLAN.md Phase 7). Every scene, the deck screens and the engine worker read the app's pool from here
 * — never from `@mc/content`'s `CORE_*` exports or `@mc/cards`' `CORE_DEPS`
 * directly — so the client can only ever run one pool at a time and adding a
 * later wave is a one-file change.
 *
 * `playableScenario` is the app's scenario builder: it hands a scenario to
 * its own wave's builder (Core's, wave 1's, cycle 1's, cycle 2's, cycle 3's or cycle 4's) and widens the game's
 * card pool to every playable card, so any deck can sit at any scenario.
