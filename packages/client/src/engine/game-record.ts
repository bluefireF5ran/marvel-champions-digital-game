/**
 * What happened in a game, in the terms the game-over screen reports it.
 *
 * **Derived, never saved.** The game's log (`initialState` + commands) is the
 * one thing persisted; this record is folded from the events that log produces,
 * either live as each command lands or all at once when a saved game is
 * replayed. Both paths run this same reducer, so a game resumed after a refresh
 * ends with exactly the summary it would have had if the tab had never closed —
 * which an in-memory tally kept by the UI could never promise.
 *
 * Every number is a count of events the engine emitted. Nothing here decides a
 * rule or guesses at a cause: attribution is "the player who controls, or else
 * owns, the card the engine named as the source".
