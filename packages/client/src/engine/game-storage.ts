/**
 * Where games are kept between visits.
 *
 * What is stored is the game's **log**, not its state: the setup config, the
 * state right after setup (the replay baseline, without its card pool, which
 * reloads from the bundle), and every command in order. PLAN.md Phase 1 made
 * `applyCommand` pure and `replay()` deterministic precisely so that a log is a
 * complete description of a game — so resuming is "replay the log", and every
 * summary the game-over screen shows is derived from it rather than saved
 * alongside it where the two could disagree.
 *
 * Commands are appended one at a time, as each lands, with their sequence
 * number checked on the way in. A missed or reordered write is an error at the
 * moment it happens rather than a replay that silently diverges later.
 *
 * Two implementations share one contract test: `MemoryGameStorage` here, for
 * Vitest and the in-thread host, and `IdbGameStorage` for the browser.

 * - 3 (2026-09-19): separate game areas, scenario decks and set-aside scenario cards, and three-sided identities
 *   add required state (docs/phase7-wave2.md §3). Saves from 2 are retired the same way.
