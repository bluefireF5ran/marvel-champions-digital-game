 * What is stored is the game's **log**, not its state: the setup config, the

 * reloads from the bundle), and every command in order. PLAN.md Phase 1 made
 * `applyCommand` pure and `replay()` deterministic precisely so that a log is a
 * complete description of a game — so resuming is "replay the log", and every
 * summary the game-over screen shows is derived from it rather than saved
 * alongside it where the two could disagree.
 *
 * Commands are appended one at a time, as each lands, with their sequence
 * number checked on the way in. A missed or reordered write is an error at the
 * moment it happens rather than a replay that silently diverges later.
 *
 * Two implementations share one contract test: `MemoryGameStorage` here, for
 * Vitest and the in-thread host, and `IdbGameStorage` for the browser.

 *   (`villains`/`activeVillainId`, `encounterDecks`, `CardInstance.home`; docs/phase7-wave1.md §3.1–§3.2). Saves
 *   from 1 are retired, not migrated (user decision, PLAN.md Phase 7): marked `incompatible`, never offered as
 *   Continue.
 * - 3 (2026-09-19): separate game areas, scenario decks and set-aside scenario cards, and three-sided identities
 *   add required state (docs/phase7-wave2.md §3). Saves from 2 are retired the same way.
 * - 4 (2026-09-22): `SaveMeta.campaignId`/`campaignNodeId` (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §10.1), so the campaign
 *   browser can link a row to the game it played and the game-over screen knows to return to the campaign. Unlike
 *   2 and 3, this changes nothing about `StateWithoutPool` — it is metadata about which save a save *is*, not a
 *   new required piece of replayable state — so a save from schema 3 is not retired: `migrateSaveMeta` upgrades it
 *   on read, filling both fields `null` (an old save was never part of a campaign), and it resumes exactly as it
 *   always did. Anything older than 3 is still retired, as before.
