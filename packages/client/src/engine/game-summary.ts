 * What the achievements need to know about a finished game, kept on its save row (`SaveMeta.summary`).

 * Everything else an achievement reads (outcome, scenario, heroes, round) is already on the row; these are the counts
 * it isn't: why a loss happened, how many heroes fell, how a winning hero stood at the end, and whether an ally was
 * ever played. Derived from the engine's final state and the game record (`game-record.ts`, itself folded from the
 * engine's events), never decided here. Plain data, so it stores and structured-clones as is.
 *
 * Pure: no storage, no Phaser. A game still being played has no summary (null).
