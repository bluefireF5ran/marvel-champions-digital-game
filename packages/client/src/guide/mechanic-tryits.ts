/**
 * The catalog of mechanic "Try it" lessons (guided mode §3.14: a hero-defining mechanic gets a short scripted
 * situation the player acts in), one row per lesson, in the order a box's page lists them. Each lesson has its own
 * stacked config (`guide/mechanic-tryit-config.ts`) and lesson data (`guide/mechanic-lessons.ts`); this file is only
 * what the "New in this box" pages need to show a row and to know where it belongs.
 *
 * A mechanic lesson is "done" the way an aspect lesson is: its id is added to `GuidePrefs.aspectLessonsDone` under
 * `mechanicLessonDoneKey`, so nothing about the saved prefs changes shape.
