/**
 * The desktop app's audio context on Linux (the Steam Deck, Bazzite and other desktops).
 *
 * WebKitGTK plays Web Audio through GStreamer into PipeWire, which runs at 48 kHz. Left to itself the context ran at
 * the music's own 44.1 kHz and was resampled on the way out, in small buffers: the owner heard crackling, popping and
 * a robotic edge on the Deck (2026-10-24). A context made at 48 kHz decodes each file to the device's rate once, up
 * front, and `latencyHint: "playback"` asks for the larger output buffers a card game can afford (the shell also
 * lengthens PulseAudio's, `src-tauri/src/main.rs`). Everywhere else the browser's own default stays.
