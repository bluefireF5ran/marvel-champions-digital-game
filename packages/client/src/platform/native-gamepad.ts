/**
 * Controllers read natively by the desktop app on Linux, in place of the webview's Gamepad API.
 *
 * WebKitGTK reported an 8BitDo Ultimate 2 with a trigger posing as a stick axis (always pushed), a dead D-pad, and
 * presses that only landed when held (Bazzite, 2026-10-24). On Linux the app reads controllers itself
 * (`src-tauri/src/gamepad_bridge.rs`, gilrs and SDL's controller database) and pushes each change as an `mc-gamepad`
 * event. Here `navigator.getGamepads()` is replaced with those pads in the standard layout (`view/native-pads.ts`),
 * so Phaser, the input bindings, the toast and the Controls screen read them unchanged, and the webview's own
 * connect and disconnect events are held back in favour of the bridge's. If the bridge stops (`stopped`), the
 * webview's own pads come back.
 *
 * Nothing runs in a browser, on Windows or macOS (the command answers `enabled: false` there), or before the bridge
 * says it is up. The main thread's share is one small event per change, at most about 120 a second while a stick moves,
 * and one check per game step while a tap is being held down for the game to see.
