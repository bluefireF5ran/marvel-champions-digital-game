 * Capacitor (iOS/Android), and wrapped by Tauri (macOS/Windows/Linux). Almost
 * nothing cares — Phaser, the engine worker and IndexedDB behave the same in
 * all three. What differs is the two dev-server routes (`/card-art/*` and
 * `/api/marvelcdb-import/*`): a packaged app has no Vite middleware behind it,
 * so there it reaches MarvelCDB through the shell's native HTTP instead, which
 * is not subject to CORS. See `native-http.ts`.
 *
 * Both shells announce themselves on the global object before any page script
 * runs, so this is a synchronous sniff and needs neither package imported.
