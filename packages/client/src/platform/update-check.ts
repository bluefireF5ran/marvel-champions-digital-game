/**
 * "Is there a newer release for this install?", for the native apps.
 *
 * The desktop and Android builds are downloaded from GitHub releases, not an app store, so nothing tells a player a
 * newer one exists. This asks GitHub's public API for the repo's latest published release (drafts and prereleases
 * are never "latest", so a release still building is not offered) and offers it only when it is newer than this
 * build *and* carries an installer for the platform it is running on. Where the install can tell which installer it
 * came from (the desktop shell's `installer_kind` command, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`), the offer links straight to that
 * file; the release page, with its notes and every download, is always the other link. The web app is redeployed on
 * every merge and never asks.
 *
 * The API sends `access-control-allow-origin: *`, so this is the webview's own `fetch` in both shells, with no native
 * HTTP scope to widen. Unauthenticated calls are limited to 60 an hour per IP; one per launch is far inside that.
