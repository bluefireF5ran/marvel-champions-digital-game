/**
 * Extras: the comics, artwork, hero and villain files and the soundtrack, opened by playing.
 *
 * **A reward shelf, not a rule.** Like the rest of `progression/`, nothing here changes how a game plays; the engine
 * never sees it. It answers one question for the Extras screen (`scenes/extras.ts`): what may the player read, look
 * at or listen to yet?
 *
 * **What opens what.** Each thing opens the moment the player has done the thing it belongs to:
 *
 * - **Stories:** a campaign issue opens once a run has reached it (signing a run opens issue #1; each issue won
 *   opens the next). Rereading one goes through the campaign's own opener, told to the box's own cast.
 * - **Heroes:** a hero's file (their artwork, both faces' names, traits and flavor) opens once a game played as that
 *   hero has ended, in a campaign or on its own.
 * - **Villains:** a villain's file opens once a game against that scenario has ended. Its "villain loses" scene
 *   opens on a win, its "villain wins" scene on a loss, so each picture is the one the player actually saw.
 * - **Music:** a track opens where it plays: a scenario's battle theme by playing it, its victory and defeat themes by
 *   winning and losing it, a campaign's finale by completing the campaign. The title theme and the default battle
 *   theme are always open.
 * - **Rulebooks:** always open. The Rules Reference, FFG's rulings since RRG 1.7 and every campaign box's rulebook,
 *   as plain text with links to the PDFs (`content/books.ts`). They are references, not rewards.
 * - **Artwork:** the title wallpapers and the loose pictures in `art/extras/` are always open; the generic victory and defeat scenes open with a first win
 *   and a first loss, and a campaign box's cover with its first run.
 *
 * **Progress is derived, never stored twice**, the same as `unlocks.ts`: `extrasProgressOf` reads the rows the
 * results history and the Saga shelf already read (`mc-saves`, `mc-campaigns`). "Unlock everything" in Settings ▸
 * Unlocks opens every extra too, since it is the way out of progression altogether.
 *
 * Pure: no storage, no Phaser. The picture and track catalogs are the build-time globs every other screen reads.
