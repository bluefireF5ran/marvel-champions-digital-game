/**
 * Progression: what a player has opened by playing, what they opened by hand, and the champion points that make
 * playing for it worth more than switching it on.
 *
 * **The unlock path.** Content is gated by release wave (`Cycle.id`), in release order. The Core Set is always
 * fully open — every villain, every hero, no switch. Every later wave opens once the player has done what the wave
 * before it asks:
 *
 * - **Wave 1** (Green Goblin, The Wrecking Crew and their heroes) and **The Rise of Red Skull**: beat Rhino, the
 *   Core Set's first villain. One win is all it takes to leave the Core Set; Wave 1 ships no campaign box to finish.
 * - **The Galaxy's Most Wanted**: complete The Rise of Red Skull campaign.
 * - **The Mad Titan's Shadow**: complete The Galaxy's Most Wanted campaign.
 * - **Sinister Motives**: complete The Mad Titan's Shadow campaign.
 * - **Mutant Genesis**: complete the Sinister Motives campaign.
 *
 * **Heroes come one villain at a time.** An open wave seats its box's own cast straight away (Hawkeye and
 * Spider-Woman; Groot and Rocket; Spectrum and Adam Warlock; Ghost-Spider and Spider-Man (Miles Morales)). Every
 * other hero of the wave is a villain's reward (`HeroReward`): beat that villain anywhere (in the campaign or
 * standalone, any difficulty) and the hero joins the roster. Wave 1's heroes are rewards for the Core and Wave 1
 * villains, in release order. Sinister Motives ships five scenarios for four hero-pack heroes (Nova, Ironheart,
 * Spider-Ham, SP//dr); its finale, Venom Goblin, is the campaign's climax rather than a "beat this one along the
 * way" villain, so it isn't spent as a reward — the box's other four scenarios are, in campaign order, matching the
 * hero packs' own release/card-number order (Nova and Ironheart released together, then Spider-Ham and SP//dr).
 *
 * Adding a wave to the app's pool means adding its row here: `unlocks.test.ts` fails until every pool wave and
 * every pool hero has a place on the path.
 *
 * **Progress is derived, never stored twice.** A win is a `won` save in `mc-saves` and a completed campaign is a
 * `won` record in `mc-campaigns`, the same rows the results history and the Saga shelf already read. Earned is
 * earned: a reward whose villain was beaten stays open whatever else is switched on or off.
 *
 * **Your own decks are always yours.** The locks are on the preconstructed decks only: a deck the player imported from
 * MarvelCDB or built in the deck builder seats whatever hero it's for (`Unlocks.deckLock`). Locked heroes can still
 * be built, so it's the precon, not the character, that play unlocks.
 *
 * **Opening things by hand.** One hero, one scenario or one campaign (which seats its cast too) costs champion
 * points (`POINTS`) the player has earned: charged once per thing, never refunded, and never more than the player
 * has, so the total can't go below zero. What was charged is kept in `UnlockPrefs.charges`.
 *
 * **Unlock everything is free.** It's the way out of points altogether, for a player who doesn't want the
 * progression: everything opens, nothing is charged, and points read as off while it's on. A dev/QA session can do
 * the same for one page load with `?unlock=all` (`progression.ts`), which is never saved.
 *
 * Pure: no storage, no Phaser. `progression.ts` owns the cache and the saved preferences.
