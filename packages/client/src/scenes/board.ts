/**
 * The Board: the table itself.
 *
 * This scene draws `BoardModel` and `Highlights` and nothing else. It holds no
 * game state, makes no legality decision, and computes no stat — it subscribes
 * to the store, asks the view models what to show, and sends every command back
 * through the store's single `dispatch` (PLAN.md Phase 4, "Phaser is a view,
 * never an authority").
 *
 * Interaction follows the design: tapping an action-bar button with targets
 * enters target-select mode (the button inverts to red), the valid targets
 * pulse, and everything not targetable drops to 35–42% rather than being
 * hidden, so the board never reflows mid-decision.
 *
 * This file is the scene's lifecycle, its overlays and the order of a draw.
 * The pieces live in `scenes/board/`:
 *  - `controller.ts` — target-select and payment modes, and every dispatch;
 *  - `selection.ts` — the selection type and the plain rules for reading it;
 *  - `context.ts` — what each draw hands the zone modules;
 *  - `chrome.ts`, `schemes.ts`, `zones.ts`, `character-panel.ts`, `hand.ts`,
 *    `payment-bar.ts`, `action-bar.ts` — one zone each;
 *  - `motion.ts` — beats and traveling cards;
 *  - `input.ts`, `tap-target.ts` — keyboard, gamepad and the card gesture.
