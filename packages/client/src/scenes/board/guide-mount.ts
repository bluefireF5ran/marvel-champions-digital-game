/**
 * The guide's thin Phaser adapter for the Board (guided mode G5c, `docs/guided-mode.md` §4): mounts
 * `GuideController` (`guide/guide-controller.ts`, pure) onto a live game, and turns its `view()` snapshot into
 * `McGuidePanel`/`McGuideCallout`/`McGuideSpotlight`/`McGuideTag` draws plus the board's own soft input gate
 * (`scenes/board/guide-gate.ts`). Desktop and tablet landscape get the rail (`McGuidePanel`); phone, phone
 * landscape and tablet portrait (`view/layout.ts`'s own `isTabbed`) get the anchored `McGuideCallout` instead,
 * with the same content and the same spotlight/tag, plus a one-shot auto-switch of the active phone tab when a
 * step's own anchor lives behind one the player isn't currently looking at (`#maybeSwitchTab`, G5c part 2).
 *
 * **Gate discipline**: `BoardScene.setGuideGate` is only ever called from `#syncGate`, and only when the current
 * step's own id actually changed — never on a plain redraw — per `docs/guided-mode.md` §4 G4c "For G5c": "set the
 * gate only on a step change, never per redraw" (a fresh `GuideGateHolder.set` resets the two-inert-clicks counter,
 * so calling it every frame would make the soft gate impossible to escape by clicking through it).
 *
 * **Banner discipline**: the spotlight/tag are held back while `BoardScene#guideBannerClear()` is false — the
 * round/phase band, or the villain-phase walkthrough overlay, is covering (or about to cover) the very thing being
 * taught (`docs/guided-mode.md` §4 G4c "For G5c": "delay the spotlight until the round/phase banner has cleared").
 * The panel itself is not held back: its rail sits beside the table, not over it, so there's nothing for the band
 * to collide with.
 *
 * **The defend-choice anchor is a known, deliberate special case, in two ways.** First, a `LessonAnchor` names
 * *what's being taught*, not *which of several open options* — the sheet can offer "No defense" alongside one or
 * more defenders, so lesson 4's own `{ kind: "choice", id: "defend" }` (`guide/tutorial-lessons.ts`) can't say
 * "Black Cat" on its own; this module names her card directly (`BLACK_CAT`) via `#syncChoicePick`. A later aspect
 * lesson with its own defend step (G10d) will need a real per-step way to name "which option" — a `LessonStep`
 * field, most likely — rather than a second hardcoded card here. Second, the `GUIDE PICK` stamp itself is drawn
 * by `ChoiceOverlay`, not by this module's own `McGuideSpotlight`/`McGuideTag` — see `#drawSpotlight`'s own
 * comment for why (a later-launched scene renders above Board, so a tag added to Board's own display list would
 * sit *underneath* the choice sheet's scrim).
 *
 * **Every Phaser widget here is rebuilt fresh on every `draw()` call, never held across redraws.** `BoardScene#draw`
 * empties its *entire* display list every single redraw (`ui/destroy-children.ts`'s own header: "what every
 * scene's redraw means by 'start from a blank screen'"), the same way every other Board zone module works
 * (`scenes/board/log.ts`'s `LogPanel.draw(scene, rect, …)` is the same shape). `McGuidePanel`/`McGuideSpotlight`/
 * `McGuideTag` were written assuming a persistent host scene that only they redraw (their own demo scenes:
 * `scenes/guide-panel-demo.ts` et al.) — holding one as a `BoardGuideMount` field and calling `.update()` on it
 * across draws crashes the moment a later `destroyChildren(this)` has already destroyed its container out from
 * under it (found in browser verification: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'sys')" the first time a
 * board redraw fired after the panel first drew). So this module keeps only *plain state* across draws
 * (`#collapsed`, the controller itself) and constructs a fresh widget instance inside `draw()` whenever one needs
 * to appear this frame — cheap, and consistent with how every other Board widget already survives this scene's
 * own redraw discipline.
