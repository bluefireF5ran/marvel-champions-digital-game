 * (the scene's update event) through `view/pad-repeat.ts`, which owns the deadzone, the hysteresis and the hold-to-
 * repeat timing, so a held direction walks the focus and the D-pad and stick share one repeater. The right stick
 * scrolls through `binding.onScroll`. Everything, repeat and scroll included, is held while `blocked()` or the sync
 * conflict prompt owns input, and a direction held when that begins does not repeat when it ends.
