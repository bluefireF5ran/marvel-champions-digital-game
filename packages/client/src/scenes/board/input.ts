/**

 * `phaser4-rex-plugins` is the widget layer's concern, not input's — this is
 * Phaser's own built-in gamepad plugin (`main.ts` turns it on; it is off by
 * default). `gamepadIntentFor` (`view/gamepad.ts`) is the only thing that
 * knows a button index means "next" or "cancel"; this only listens and
 * forwards, exactly as `bindKeyboard` does for the keyboard's own keys.
 *
 * `Gamepad.on("down", ...)` (bound below via the plugin, not the pad
 * instance) fires once per press, not once per held frame, so there is no
 * repeat-rate to manage the way a keyboard's OS auto-repeat already handles
 * itself. Continuous analog-stick movement is not wired — a D-pad or the
 * face buttons cover every intent this board has, and a stick's constant
 * drift would need its own deadzone-and-repeat timer this pass doesn't
 * need to take on.
