 * "PAYING 1 / 3 — Photon Blast → Klaw. Tap cards to spend." on Hero Red, with
 * Pay and Cancel, exactly as `Board - Phone` frames the mode.
 *
 * The mock's bar carries only Cancel, and commits the moment the count fills.
 * This one has an explicit Pay because a payment can legitimately exceed the
 * printed cost — "spend X [energy]" counts every resource beyond the fixed
 * cost, so auto-committing at the first sufficient selection would take that
 * choice away (docs/phase2-core-set.md §3, "Spend X").
