/**
 * The board's own opportunistic-tip mount (guided mode G10e part 2, `docs/guided-mode.md` §4 G10e "Part 2
 * (display)"): the thin Phaser adapter that turns `view/tip-schedule.ts#advance`'s pacing decisions into a drawn
 * `McTipToast`. Unlike `BoardGuideMount` (the scripted-lesson rail/callout, only built for a guided tutorial run —
 * `appSession().guidedRun`), this mount is always built once a game exists: opportunistic tips are "the main use"
 * at the Full guide level in an ordinary, non-tutorial game (this box's own brief), not a tutorial-only feature.
 *
 * **Every Phaser widget here is rebuilt fresh on every draw, never held across redraws** — the same discipline
 * `scenes/board/guide-mount.ts`'s own header documents and for the identical reason: `BoardScene#draw` empties its
 * entire display list every redraw (`ui/destroy-children.ts`), so a `McTipToast` instance held as a field would
 * reference containers Phaser already destroyed out from under it the next time this module tried to update it.
 *
 * **Pacing lives in `view/tip-schedule.ts`, not here.** This module's own job is narrower: feed it observations,
 * remember which `Tip` (if any) is currently displayed, mark it seen the moment it's shown (`markTipSeen`, per the
 * brief: "mark a tip seen when it's shown"), auto-hide it the moment the player does anything else (the next fresh
 * store update, whatever it is), and never draw it while `blocked()` says an overlay or a lesson step already owns
 * the screen.
 *
 * **The tutorial's own suppressed ids** (`TUTORIAL_SUPPRESSED_TIP_IDS`): while a guided run is active, three
 * opportunistic-tip ids duplicate content the scripted lessons already teach on their own schedule — lesson 2
 * ("Hero & alter-ego") covers hand size differing by form, and lesson 4 ("The villain phase") covers both a boost
 * card flipping during an enemy's activation and a Spider-Sense-style draw on being attacked. The brief also names
 * "flip", "paying" and "thwart" as lesson content, but no opportunistic tip exists for any of those today (`flip`,
 * `resource`/`cost` and `thwart` are basic-concept glossary ids, never emitted by `tipsFor`'s own glossary catch-all,
 * which only surfaces keywords/statuses — `guide-tips.ts`'s own `glossaryTips` calls `rulesGlossaryOf` without
 * `includeConcepts`) — there's nothing to suppress for those, so this list only names the three that actually fire.
