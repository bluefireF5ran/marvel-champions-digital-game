/**
 * C05/C06 — Aftermath: folding a finished campaign game back into the log (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §7).
 *
 * Entered straight from Game over (`scenes/game-over.ts`'s "Continue the campaign ▸"): the store's current game is
 * still the one that just ended, so `#load` reads its outcome and saves it (`appSession().store.save()`), then
 * drives `campaignService().fold` to completion.
 *
 * A **loss** folds with no questions in MC10 and leaves straight for Rewind. A **win** may ask one or more victory
 * choices (`view/campaign-aftermath-model.ts`): the runner asks one seat at a time, but this screen shows every
 * seat's column at once, lets the player make every seat's pick locally, and only sends real answers to the engine
 * on commit — each one checked against what the engine actually offers before it's sent.
 *
 * **A known simplification.** The design's own tile (07-d-c06) shows the "LOGGED · 3 DELAY COUNTERS" tag *while*
 * a choice is still pending — but that number only exists once the whole victory list has resolved
 * (`CampaignHistoryEntry.steps`), which the runner doesn't expose mid-fold (only the final `"done"` log has it).
 * Reading it early would mean re-deriving a `record`-kind write from the finished game ourselves, which is exactly
 * the "client computes state" mistake CLAUDE.md rules out. So the tag appears only once this fold has nothing left
 * to ask — for MC10, that's issue #1 (which has no shared numeric write at all) and any win with no pending choice
 * at all; a win that *does* ask a choice (issue #2's optional Condition upgrade) shows the stamp without the tag,
 * because by the time it's known the screen has already moved on.
