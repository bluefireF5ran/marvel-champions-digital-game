/**
 * C08 — Briefing: composes the next issue's between-games setup (answering any question it asks), shows what
 * happened automatically and what the player still has to decide, shows the two decks, and starts the game.
 *
 * Composing (`campaignService().compose`) asks one choice at a time and re-runs from the top on every answer
 * (`campaign-service.ts`'s own doc comment) — this scene accumulates `#answers` across re-entries and keeps
 * re-calling `compose` until it comes back `"done"`, exactly the loop the service's doc comment describes. Nothing
 * half-answered is ever shown as settled: `#pending` is only ever the *current* unanswered question.
