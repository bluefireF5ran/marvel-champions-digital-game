/**
 * C03 — the issue opener: a header (issue number, the issue's Bangers title, "SKIP ▸▸"), three tap-through comic
 * panels (stacked on phone), and a bottom CTA that reveals the next panel or, once every panel is up, leaves for
 * the Briefing. All copy is `campaign/story.ts`'s (`issueStoryFor`); this scene only sequences the reveal
 * (`view/campaign-opener-model.ts`) and draws what it returns.
 *
 * A box told as full comic pages (`CampaignStory.pages` set, GMW today) instead uses the page-based comic reader
 * (`ui/comic-reader.ts` over `view/comic-reader-model.ts`) for any issue that names `comicBeats` — detected from the
 * story's own data, never `campaignId`, so a later page-based box picks this up for free. An issue with no
 * `comicBeats` (every MC10 issue, and any GMW issue not yet given a page split) keeps the three-panel opener below
 * untouched.
 *
 * Two entries (`routes.ts`'s `CampaignOpenerData`):
 *  - The run's own issue (`data.nodeId` absent): a composed attempt's node, else `record.position.nextNodeId`
 *    (`currentNodeIdOf`). Skip/finish go to Briefing.
 *  - A reread of a finished issue (`data.nodeId` + `data.returnTo`, Run's "Reread issue #2"): the same panels, then
 *    back to `returnTo` instead of Briefing — nothing here needs to know it's a reread beyond that one branch.
 *  - A read from Extras (`data.campaignId` + `data.nodeId` + `data.returnTo`, no `runId`): the same panels with no run
 *    behind them, so the box's own cast (`CampaignStory.castIdentityIds`) stands in for the roster and the issue is
 *    numbered by its place in the story.
