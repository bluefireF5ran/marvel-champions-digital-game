/**
 * What each campaign screen is started with — the contract between screens built by different hands. Every screen
 * takes a `runId` (a stored `CampaignRecord.id`) and loads the record itself through `campaignService()`, so no
 * screen hands another a stale copy of the log: the store is the one source of truth, exactly as the game store is
 * for the Board.
 *
 * The flow (C00b → C11):
 *
 *   Title ─▶ Saga ─▶ Cover ─▶ (new run) Roster ─▶ Opener ─▶ Briefing ─▶ [game: setup deal → Board ⇄ Beat overlay]
 *                       │                                                    │
 *                       ├─▶ Run ─▶ Issue detail                         Game over ─▶ Aftermath ─▶ Opener (next issue)
 *                       └─▶ Dossier (overview/log/heroes/issues)                   │        └─▶ Finale (last issue)
 *                                                                                  └─▶ Rewind (a loss) ─▶ Briefing
 *
 * `CampaignDeckEdit` is reachable from Briefing, Rewind and Dossier › Heroes and returns to `returnTo`.
