/**
 * The pending-choice overlay.
 *
 * It runs in parallel over Board (`scene.launch`), so the table stays visible
 * underneath while a decision is open — the design's overlay sheet: an ink
 * title bar with a boxed ✕, a 70%-ink scrim, and one red commit plus quiet
 * alternatives.
 *
 * The engine's `PendingChoice.options` already lists every legal answer, so
 * this screen only has to present them and send the ids back. It labels *why*
 * this player is deciding from `PendingChoice.authority`, which is what makes
 * an encounter-side decision legible as one (docs/phase3-encounter-ai.md).
