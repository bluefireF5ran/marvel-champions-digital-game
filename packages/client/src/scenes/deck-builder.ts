/**
 * The minimal deck builder (PLAN.md Phase 9): pick an identity and its
 * aspect(s), name the deck, search/filter the pool, add and remove cards, and
 * save — with live legality from the same `validateDeck` the Decks screen and
 * `createGame` use (`view/deck-builder-model.ts`'s `legalityOf`). This scene
 * decides nothing about what's legal; it only shows what the engine already
 * said.
 *
 * Two entries: `{ deck }` edits a saved deck (its identity is already fixed);
 * `{}` starts fresh, showing only the identity picker until one is chosen —
 * `Deck.identityCardId` is required, so there is no `Deck` to build against
 * until then (`view/deck-builder-model.ts`'s `newDeck` needs an identity).
 *
 * The pool browser is a long, filterable list — wave 1 more than doubles the
 * pool — so it is a `McVirtualList` (`ui/virtual-list.ts`), the same widget
 * the Decks screen's deck list uses: recreated fresh every `#rebuild()` (like
 * every other non-DOM control this scene draws), with only its scroll
 * position (`#listScroll`) surviving that.
 *
 * **Composition (fidelity pass, 2026-09-17), against D04.** D04 is a
 * three-column desktop layout — an aspect/filter rail (ending in the cost
 * curve) on the left, the card pool in the middle, "Your deck" on an ink
 * ground on the right — over one legality chip in the header. From
 * `WIDE_MIN_WIDTH` up this scene now draws exactly that split
 * (`#rebuildWide`); below it, every control still stacks in the one column
 * this scene always drew (`#rebuildNarrow`), unchanged. **What stayed a
 * deviation, deliberately:** D04 has no visible deck-name field or Save
 * button — its mockup deck is already named by identity+aspect and "saving"
 * reads as the next setup step ("Table setup ▸"), which doesn't exist yet
 * (W2). This build still needs to name and persist a deck with no setup flow
 * to hand it to, so the name field and a real Save button live at the top of
 * the right (ink) column instead of being dropped — the closest real
 * equivalent of "the deck's own identity" the mockup shows there. Every
 * number and legality string is still `view/deck-stats.ts`/`legalityOf`'s
 * own; this pass only rearranges where they're drawn.
 *
 * Unlike the other four W1/W4 screens in this fidelity pass, this scene has
 * no dedicated `view/*-layout.ts` pure layout module — every rect is computed
 * inline against a running `y` cursor per column, the same shape this file
 * already had. A future pass extracting that into a tested pure function
 * (the way `deck-check-layout.ts` already does for Deck check) is real,
 * unstarted work; this pass keeps the existing architecture rather than
 * introducing a new one under time pressure.
