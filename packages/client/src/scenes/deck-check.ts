/**
 * Deck check (W1, docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3, P04/D04): a deck's resource
 * curve, composition, legality and full card list at a glance, with "Edit
 * deck" back into the builder and "Start game ▸" into the setup flow —
 * reached today from the Decks screen's own "Check" button on every row,
 * precon or saved, and from Seats' "Deck check ▸" for the active seat.
 *
 * **Rebuilt 2026-09-18 for the owner's fidelity note: "The 'Deck Check'
 * screens and elements there don't flow well with the design."** — and
 * rebuilt again the same day once a real screenshot of D04
 * (`artifacts/design-screenshots/individual/screens-desktop.dc/04-s04.png`)
 * showed what the first rebuild guessed wrong: D04 ("Deck builder — live
 * validation against the 40–50 rule") **is** this step's own desktop
 * composition, the same canvas `scenes/deck-builder.ts` already draws —
 * this screen draws the read-only "check" version of exactly that
 * three-column layout, not an unrelated two-column shape. See
 * `view/deck-check-layout.ts`'s own doc comment for the column-by-column
 * accounting; the short version: an ink header (Back, "HERO — ASPECT",
 * a green/red "N CARDS · LEGAL" badge) over `rail` (aspect tiles, read-only;
 * type filter chips, live; the cost curve, pinned at the rail's own foot) ·
 * `cards` (the deck's own card grid, real scans) · `panel` (the full ink
 * "YOUR DECK" list, with Edit deck and Start game ▸ pinned at its foot) —
 * `scenes/deck-builder.ts`'s own rail/pool/rail widths reused verbatim so
 * the two screens' columns line up when a player moves between them.
 *
 * Narrow (phone/tabletPortrait) stays P04's own shape: a "YOUR DECK · N"
 * header with a step fraction, a Curve/Cards/Aspect tab strip, and a footer
 * (Edit deck, Start game ▸). The Curve tab draws P04's own per-bucket
 * rainbow bars (`ui/deck-stats-widgets.ts`'s `drawRainbowCurveBars`) — a
 * genuinely different chart from the wide rail's "ink bars, peak cost in
 * red" one (`drawStatCurveBars`, the same chart Decks & Collection's own ink
 * stats rail draws), not a simplification of it — plus the three sample
 * tiles (Resources/Allies/Events) and a short few-card preview P04 itself
 * shows there; the full list lives one tab over. The amber advice banner
 * P04 also draws is skipped (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §4: advice text is
 * unsettled/out of scope).
 *
 * **The entry point is deliberately caller-agnostic**: `DeckCheckSceneData`
 * takes a `Deck` plus an optional `returnTo` (defaults to the Decks screen)
 * and an optional `onStartGame`. The header's Back label and narrow's step
 * fraction both read `returnTo.scene` to tell whether this is a step in
 * Seats' own setup flow or a standalone visit from Decks — nothing else
 * about this scene depends on which. Until Seats supplies `onStartGame`,
 * "Start game ▸" draws unavailable with its reason, per §0's "dashed = not
 * yet real" rather than being omitted.
 *
 * Every number comes from `view/deck-stats.ts` (`deckStatsOf`, `costCurveBars`,
 * `deckListGroupsOf`, `filterDeckListGroups`) and `@mc/engine`'s own legality
 * verdict (`view/deck-list-model.ts`'s `deckOptionOf`) — this scene only
 * draws what those already computed, the same "client renders, never
 * computes" rule `deck-builder.ts` follows. The rail's type filter chips are
 * a display filter only (which of the deck's own cards the grid shows), like
 * the builder's own pool filter — never a deckbuilding rule.
 *
 * **Multi-seat note**: Seats can have several filled seats, but neither P04
 * nor D04 draws a seat switcher for this step — there is nowhere in the
 * design for one, and inventing a control the tile doesn't show risks
 * exactly the "doesn't flow with the design" complaint this pass is fixing.
 * Checking a different seat's deck means going Back to Seats, selecting that
 * seat, and reopening "Deck check ▸" — a real gap, left for a follow-up
 * rather than guessed at here.
 *
 * **Tap-to-inspect, not tap-plus-hold.** The card grid's only action is
 * Inspect, so a tap alone opens it (`McVariableList#onRowActivate`, the same
 * "a row with no button of its own" pattern Decks' and Rules' own card grids
 * already use — `scenes/decks.ts`'s `#drawPoolPane`, `scenes/rules.ts`'s
 * `#drawCardListTab`) rather than wiring `ui/hold-target.ts`'s separate
 * tap/long-press gesture for a second action this screen has no use for.
