/**
 * The Decks & Collection screen (PLAN.md Phase 9 / W9b, docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md
 * §3, D14): every precon plus every saved or imported deck, each with its
 * legality/playability status; a searchable, filterable list (S8); the
 * *selected* deck's own browsable card pool; its stats; import by paste
 * (works everywhere) and by MarvelCDB URL/id (dev/preview through the
 * same-origin route `vite-marvelcdb-import.ts` adds, and in a packaged app
 * through native HTTP — `platform/deck-fetch.ts`); save, delete, duplicate,
 * export, and "Play this deck ▸".
 *
 * **The composition, read straight off D14's own markup** (`ScreensDesktop_12`/
 * `_13`.png plus `Marvel Champions game screens/Screens - Desktop.dc.html`'s
 * `#s14` — see `view/decks-layout.ts`'s own header comment for the full
 * reasoning): an ink chrome bar (Back, a large Bangers screen title, a
 * right-aligned pool-count label) over a paper ground, then three columns —
 * **"YOUR DECKS"** (the list *owns* the column — search plus a collapsed-by-
 * default "Filters" toggle in one compact row, then deck cards filling
 * whatever's left, ink-filled selected with its record shown only there,
 * red-bordered illegal/WIP, "+ NEW DECK" on the column header's own line (always in view), a small
 * group label folded into the top of each group's first card rather than its
 * own full-height row, then a *compact* parchment Import/Export box pinned to
 * the column's bottom with its paste/MarvelCDB/export fields collapsed behind
 * three small buttons), **"CARD POOL"** (the *selected* deck's own browsable
 * legal cards, filter chips right-aligned on the header's own rule line, each
 * cell's art, a cost pip, and an uppercase "TYPE · X OF Y IN DECK" caption),
 * and the **ink stats rail** (a large Bangers deck title, curve bars with the
 * deck's most-common costs in red, composition tiles as a label over a
 * Bangers number, "Recently changed", ending in DUPLICATE + the single red
 * "PLAY THIS DECK ▸"). Narrow screens get the same three groups behind a
 * "Decks"/"Cards"/"Stats" tab strip.
 *
 * **Deliberately not the mock, each noted where it happens:** the mock's
 * Import/Export box shows description text only — this build already has
 * paste-import, MarvelCDB-import and export, so those controls live inside
 * that box, collapsed behind small buttons so the box stays compact by
 * default. The deck note and owned-card tracking are both skipped per
 * docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §4 (advice text and owned-card tracking are
 * undecided/out of scope) — the header's right-aligned label says the real
 * pool size ("CARD POOL · N CARDS") rather than the mock's "Core Set · N of N
 * owned" wording, since this pool already spans Core and wave 1 and "Core
 * Set" would misstate that (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §5's own standard).
 * S8's search field and quick-filter chips (added after D14 was drawn) sit
 * above the deck list, collapsed by default so they cost one compact row
 * rather than crowding the list out. A precon's card title is its short
 * "HERO / ASPECT" form (its long printed name moves into the meta line);
 * a saved/imported deck's title is simply its own name, already short because
 * a player chose it. Check/Edit/Delete — real, needed actions the mock
 * doesn't draw at all — live as a row of small buttons in the stats rail,
 * under the composition tiles, so the rail's own footer still ends in exactly
 * Duplicate + the red Play button, as designed. The pool's art area draws a
 * real card's own 2.5:3.5 shape rather than the mock's arbitrarily-tall
 * placeholder box (`view/deck-pool-grid.ts`'s own header comment). Not
 * reproduced: the mock's red ring on a hovered/focused pool cell — this
 * screen's per-cell objects are torn down and redrawn on every scene
 * `#rebuild()` (`ui/virtual-list.ts`'s own documented pattern), so a
 * pointer-move-driven highlight would need a lighter-weight redraw path than
 * that; left as a follow-up rather than added under this pass's time budget.
 *
 * **Community decks** (2026-10-10, `view/community-decks-model.ts`): the tested public MarvelCDB decklists
 * (`@mc/cards`'s `communityDecks`) are a third list group, after the player's own decks. They are recommendations,
 * labeled as community decks from MarvelCDB and never as precons. Selecting one shows its own card list in the
 * middle pane (cards open in Inspect) and, in the stats rail's place, the author's credit, a Tested stamp, the
 * decklist's published date and version, the author's notes, the MarvelCDB link and one action: add an editable copy. A deck
 * whose hero or cards the player has not unlocked is shown dimmed with what opens it, and cannot be added.
 *
 * A deck row's tap **selects** it (updates the pool and stats panes) rather
 * than navigating away; a pool card's tap opens Inspect (this screen never
 * edits a deck's contents — that's `scenes/deck-builder.ts`, reached from
 * "Edit"). Every legality/playability/record fact shown here is `@mc/engine`'s
 * own (`view/deck-list-model.ts`'s `deckOptionsOf`, `view/deck-status.ts` for
 * the chip's words, `view/results-history.ts` for the record) — this scene
 * never decides whether a deck is legal or what its record is.
