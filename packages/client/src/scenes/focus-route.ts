/**
 * Keyboard and gamepad focus for a screen whose stops are just its controls:
 * Title/Setup, the villain-phase walkthrough and Game Over.
 *
 * The Board and the choice sheet each carry their own route because their
 * stops are cards that move between zones and rows. These screens are simpler —
 * a stop is a control with a rect and something it does — so they share this.
 * The *order* is still stated by the screen (`view/screen-focus.ts`, or a
 * screen's own action list), never taken from the order of its draw calls.
 *
 * Same conventions as everywhere else: Tab walks the route, the arrows move to
 * the nearest stop that way on screen (`view/spatial-nav.ts`), Enter or
 * Space presses, `I` reads (where a stop has something to read), Escape backs
 * out, and the ring is the selection ring drawn static — a pulse means "the game
 * is waiting for you", and focus is not a prompt.
