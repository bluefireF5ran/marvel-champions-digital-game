/**
 * The Inspect overlay: one card, whole.
 *
 * The table caps rules text at two lines on purpose (Components.dc.html section
 * 06, "numbers before prose"), which only works if the full wording is always
 * one gesture away. This is that gesture's destination, and it runs in parallel
 * over Board so the table stays visible behind the scrim.
 *
 * **Rebuilt to D08/P14 (owner feedback, 2026-09-18): "The inspect screen looks
 * better in the screenshots with more info showing."** Two shapes, chosen by
 * `view/inspect-layout.ts#inspectLayout` (its own doc comment has the D08/T06
 * tablet reasoning):
 *  - **Panels** (every non-phone form factor, tablet included): a paper card
 *    panel — cost chip, Bangers name, type line, the scan, rules text, resource
 *    pips, set/collector footer — beside an ink "Rules & state" panel: "right
 *    now" (the engine's own playable/unplayable sentence, enriched with the
 *    open payment's resources-committed count when one exists for this exact
 *    card), "timing" (ability-header glossary entries — honestly empty for
 *    most cards; see `view/inspect-model.ts#timingEntriesFor`'s own comment
 *    for why), tappable keyword chips (open Rules at that term), "this card,
 *    this game" (the accumulated per-instance history), and PLAY IT / USE AS
 *    RESOURCE.
 *  - **Sheet** (phone only): a bottom sheet over the dimmed board — a grab
 *    handle, a scrolling body (thumbnail, name, type, keyword chips, rules
 *    text, then the same keyword definitions and "this game" history folded
 *    into the same scroll — see the note in `#drawSheetContent`), and a sticky
 *    footer (PLAY N / PAY WITH, then FULL RULES TEXT / CLOSE). "Full rules
 *    text" expands the sheet to the full viewport height.
 *
 * Everything on the card face comes from `@mc/content`; everything on the
 * rules/state side comes from the engine (`legalActions`, the glossary, and
 * the client's own accumulated card-history fold, `view/card-history.ts`,
 * read off the live Board scene). This scene decides nothing — it only asks
 * `view/inspect-model.ts` and draws the answer.
 *
 * Z-ORDER VS. THE PENDING-CHOICE OVERLAY (`scenes/choice.ts`)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `scenes/villain-phase.ts` calls `this.scene.bringToTop(SCENES.choice)` on
 * every store update while a choice is open, so the sheet the player must
 * *act* on always wins over the walkthrough that only narrates
 * (`villain-phase.ts`'s own doc comment). `bringToTop` doesn't just set a
 * z-index, it splices the scene to the tail of the Scene Manager's render
 * list — a standing position that survives until something moves it again.
 * So the first villain-phase decision of a game leaves `SCENES.choice`
 * sitting above `SCENES.inspect`'s ordinary (registration-order) position for
 * the rest of the session, in or out of the villain phase — the bug where
 * Inspect, opened by right-clicking a card inside an open choice (e.g.
 * Black Panther's discard search), rendered *behind* the choice sheet that
 * launched it.
 *
 * Here the priority is the opposite of the villain-phase/choice one: Inspect
 * was just opened *deliberately* by the player to read the very card the
 * choice is asking about, so it must win. `#rebuild` re-asserts
 * `bringToTop(SCENES.inspect)` every time it runs — i.e. on every store
 * update this scene is subscribed to, the same cadence `villain-phase.ts`
 * uses for its own claim — so whichever of the two fires last for a given
 * tick decides the frame, and `SessionStore.subscribe` notifies listeners in subscription
 * order (a `Set`, iterated in insertion order): Inspect always subscribes
 * *after* Choice/VillainPhase, because it is only ever launched from a click
 * inside one of them, so its claim always runs last and wins. Dismissing
 * Inspect only stops the Inspect scene (`#close`); it never touches Choice,
 * so the choice sheet — never stopped, only briefly drawn-under — is exactly
 * what reappears once Inspect closes.
