/**
 * Lets a pad leave a text field it put the caret in.
 *
 * A screen's route stands aside while its search or seed field has the caret (`McTextInput.focused`), so the pad's
 * buttons all went to the held route and nothing could end the typing: a controller player who pressed A on the field
 * was stuck there (the keyboard has Enter and Escape inside the field itself, `ui/widgets.ts`). While a field is
 * focused, B, A and Start take the caret out. The route hears nothing from that press: it is held while the field
 * has the caret, and the caret leaves a frame later, so the same press cannot also back out of the screen.
 *
 * Frame order matters. Decks and the deck builder call this BEFORE creating their `FocusRoute`. The press that puts the caret in a field (A on
 * the field's stop) is handled by the route; if this listener ran after it in the same frame it would see the field
 * already focused and take the caret straight back out. Bound first, it sees the field unfocused for that press.
