/**
 * The villain phase, drawn as the design's auto-advancing walkthrough
 * (PLAN.md Phase 4, "villain phase as a walkthrough"; docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md
 * §3 "W7").
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * COMPOSITION (D11, P09, L02 — docs/design-reference.md)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A full-bleed ink panel, not a centered card. Desktop and tablet landscape:
 * header (title + Skip), subtitle, the five-step strip, then a two-column
 * split down to the footer — a wide main column ("happening now"'s
 * breakdown, the boost cards it revealed, and "queued this phase") beside a
 * narrower rail (the main-scheme threat callout, then the phase log). Phone
 * collapses the step strip to one compact line and stacks every section in
 * one column instead. `view/villain-phase-layout.ts` owns the actual
 * geometry; this scene only reads it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BOARD CONTRACT (read this before wiring the launch call)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The Board scene must launch this overlay with a bare, payload-free call,
 * exactly once per villain phase:
 *
 *   if (
 *     !this.scene.isActive(SCENES.villainPhase) &&
 *     state.lastEvents.some((e) => e.type === "stepChanged" && e.to.phase === "villain" && e.to.kind === "placeThreat")
 *   ) {
 *     this.scene.launch(SCENES.villainPhase);
 *   }
 *
 * That is the *only* thing Board needs to do. Why this exact condition:
 *  - `placeThreat` is step one, so this event fires exactly once per villain
 *    phase — never on the later within-phase step changes (enemyActivations,
 *    dealEncounterCards, ...), which would otherwise re-open a walkthrough the
 *    player already skipped (see "Skip", below).
 *  - The `isActive` guard is load-bearing and must not be dropped. `launch` is
 *    NOT a no-op on an already-running scene in Phaser 4.2.1: it queues
 *    `SceneManager.start`, which for a scene in RUNNING..SLEEPING calls
 *    `sys.shutdown()` and then `sys.start()` — a full restart that would throw
 *    away this scene's accumulated beats and reveal cursor mid-phase. `run()`
 *    is no safer: a RUNNING scene falls through its sleeping/paused branches to
 *    the same `start()`. With the step-one condition above the guard is belt
 *    and braces today, but it is what makes the condition safe to loosen.
 *  - Everything else — reading the round, accumulating beats across the
 *    several `dispatch` calls one villain phase can span (a mid-phase pause
 *    means the phase resumes in a *later* command with its own `lastEvents`),
 *    noticing the phase ended, and closing itself — happens inside this scene
 *    by subscribing to the store directly. Board passes nothing and is told
 *    nothing back.
 *
 * COEXISTENCE WITH THE PENDING-CHOICE OVERLAY (`scenes/choice.ts`)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Both overlays run in parallel over Board and may be open at once — most of
 * this screen's pauses *are* an open `PendingChoice`. `ChoiceOverlay` is
 * normally the one that actually collects the answer; this screen only
 * narrates, and shows the same "Auto-advance paused ..." label the choice
 * sheet also has available (`decisionLabel`/`pauseFor` share their
 * reasoning). Whenever a `pendingChoice` is open and `ChoiceOverlay` is
 * running, this scene keeps the choice sheet ordered above itself (checked
 * every frame — see `#orderAgainstChoice` for why a per-update check was not
 * enough), so the thing the player must act on is never hidden behind the
 * thing that's just narrating.
 *
 * The one exception is the inline interrupt window (D11/P09/L02,
 * `inlineInterruptFor`): when the open choice is the viewer's own
 * `chooseTriggers` and there is something legal to interrupt with, this
 * screen draws that card and its own "Play"/"Let it resolve" controls
 * *itself*, dispatching through `resolveChoice` exactly as the choice sheet
 * would (same option ids, same call) — so the log reads no differently
 * whichever surface answered it. In that one case this scene brings *itself*
 * to the top instead of the choice sheet, so its own buttons are the ones
 * that receive the click; the choice sheet is still running underneath
 * (unchanged, and still reachable the moment this screen closes) but this
 * panel's own background covers it, the same way any two full-bleed overlays
 * would.
 *
 * SKIP / DISMISS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A villain phase the player has already read should not be a wall (PLAN.md).
 * "Skip" (button, top right) and Esc (or B on a pad) both fade this panel out and then call
 * `this.scene.stop()` (`#close`, `ui/transitions.ts`'s `OverlayMotion`) and do nothing else —
 * Board's own state is untouched, the actual game keeps
 * running underneath exactly as it would with this screen open. Because the
 * launch condition only fires on step one, skipping mid-phase does not get
 * this screen re-opened by a later step change in the same phase.
 *
 * SELF-CLOSING
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This scene watches the same store Board does. Once the walkthrough reports
 * `complete` and every beat it knows about has been revealed, the screen shows
 * a "Continue" button and, at normal motion, also closes itself after a short
 * pause (`#syncTiming`, `AUTO_CLOSE_DELAY_MS`) — so an unattended screen doesn't
 * sit there forever, but a player who wants the last word can still act on it
 * before the timer does. Under reduced motion there is no such timer (see REDUCED
 * MOTION below). Because a whole phase can
 * (and often does) finish revealing between two store updates — an activation
 * pausing on a decision that itself resolves the rest of the phase, the usual
 * case — `#syncTiming` re-checks and arms the close timer from the reveal
 * timer's own tick the moment it catches up, not only from a fresh store
 * update; the pre-2026-09-29 version of this scene armed it only from
 * `#onState`, so a phase that caught up between updates sat fully shown,
 * `complete`, and un-closing until Skip. Similarly, if `state.game` disappears
 * or the game ends (`state.game.outcome`), the scene stops itself without
 * waiting to be told.
 *
 * REDUCED MOTION
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The whole reason this screen exists is that the engine can hand over an
 * entire five-step phase in one burst (`view/villain-walkthrough.ts`), so
 * normally beats are revealed one at a time on a readable timer
 * (`view/villain-phase-reveal.ts`). Under reduced motion there is no timer:
 * every beat currently known is shown the instant it arrives, and the player
 * reads at their own pace rather than a timer's — "no travel/animation; the
 * beats still appear and the player can step through" is satisfied because
 * nothing is gated behind a wait, only behind the player's own reading speed
 * and the Skip/Continue controls, which work identically either way.
