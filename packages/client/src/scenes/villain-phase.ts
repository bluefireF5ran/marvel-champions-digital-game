/**
 * The villain phase, drawn as the design's auto-advancing walkthrough
 * (PLAN.md Phase 4, "villain phase as a walkthrough"; docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md
 * §3 "W7").
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * COMPOSITION (D11, P09, L02 — docs/design-reference.md)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A full-bleed ink panel, not a centered card. Desktop and tablet landscape:
 * header (title + Skip), subtitle, the five-step strip, then a two-column
 * split down to the footer — a wide main column ("happening now"'s
 * breakdown, the boost cards it revealed, and "queued this phase") beside a
 * narrower rail (the main-scheme threat callout, then the phase log). Phone
 * collapses the step strip to one compact line and stacks every section in
 * one column instead. `view/villain-phase-layout.ts` owns the actual
 * geometry; this scene only reads it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BOARD CONTRACT (read this before wiring the launch call)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The Board scene launches this overlay exactly once per villain phase, passing the game from before the
 * command that began it as `VillainPhaseLaunchData`:
 *
 *   if (
 *     !this.scene.isActive(SCENES.villainPhase) &&
 *     state.lastEvents.some((e) => e.type === "stepChanged" && e.to.phase === "villain" && e.to.kind === "placeThreat")
 *   ) {
 *     this.scene.launch(SCENES.villainPhase, { before });
 *   }
 *
 * That is the *only* thing Board needs to do. Why this exact condition:
 *  - `placeThreat` is step one, so this event fires exactly once per villain
 *    phase — never on the later within-phase step changes (enemyActivations,
 *    dealEncounterCards, ...), which would otherwise re-open a walkthrough the
 *    player already skipped (see "Skip", below).
 *  - The `isActive` guard is load-bearing and must not be dropped. `launch` is
 *    NOT a no-op on an already-running scene in Phaser 4.2.1: it queues
 *    `SceneManager.start`, which for a scene in RUNNING..SLEEPING calls
 *    `sys.shutdown()` and then `sys.start()` — a full restart that would throw
 *    away this scene's accumulated beats and reveal cursor mid-phase. `run()`
 *    is no safer: a RUNNING scene falls through its sleeping/paused branches to
 *    the same `start()`. With the step-one condition above the guard is belt
 *    and braces today, but it is what makes the condition safe to loosen.
 *  - Everything else — reading the round, accumulating beats across the
 *    several `dispatch` calls one villain phase can span (a mid-phase pause
 *    means the phase resumes in a *later* command with its own `lastEvents`),
 *    noticing the phase ended, and closing itself — happens inside this scene
 *    by subscribing to the store directly. Board is told nothing back.
 *
 * COEXISTENCE WITH THE PENDING-CHOICE OVERLAY (`scenes/choice.ts`)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Both overlays run in parallel over Board and may be open at once — most of
 * this screen's pauses *are* an open `PendingChoice`. `ChoiceOverlay` is
 * normally the one that actually collects the answer; this screen only
 * narrates, and shows the same "Auto-advance paused ..." label the choice
 * sheet also has available (`decisionLabel`/`pauseFor` share their
 * reasoning). Whenever a `pendingChoice` is open and `ChoiceOverlay` is
 * running, this scene keeps the choice sheet ordered above itself (checked
 * every frame — see `#orderAgainstChoice` for why a per-update check was not
 * enough), so the thing the player must act on is never hidden behind the
 * thing that's just narrating.
 *
 * The one exception is the inline interrupt window (D11/P09/L02,
 * `inlineInterruptFor`): when the open choice is the viewer's own
 * `chooseTriggers` and there is something legal to interrupt with, this
 * screen draws that card and its own "Play"/"Let it resolve" controls
 * *itself*, dispatching through `resolveChoice` exactly as the choice sheet
 * would (same option ids, same call) — so the log reads no differently
 * whichever surface answered it. In that one case this scene brings *itself*
 * to the top instead of the choice sheet, so its own buttons are the ones
 * that receive the click; the choice sheet is still running underneath
 * (unchanged, and still reachable the moment this screen closes) but this
 * panel's own background covers it, the same way any two full-bleed overlays
 * would.
 *
 * SKIP / DISMISS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A villain phase the player has already read should not be a wall (PLAN.md).
 * "Skip" (button, top right) and Esc (or B on a pad) both fade this panel out and then call
 * `this.scene.stop()` (`#close`, `ui/transitions.ts`'s `OverlayMotion`) and do nothing else —
 * Board's own state is untouched, the actual game keeps
 * running underneath exactly as it would with this screen open. Because the
 * launch condition only fires on step one, skipping mid-phase does not get
 * this screen re-opened by a later step change in the same phase.
 *
 * FINISHING: THE HELD-OPEN RECAP (#117)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This scene watches the same store Board does. Once the walkthrough reports `complete` and every beat it knows
 * about has been revealed, it draws the recap instead of the walkthrough panel (`ui/villain-recap-panel.ts`,
 * `view/villain-recap.ts`; mockups D3/T3/P4): what changed, then every card of the five steps in the order it
 * happened, with an AUTO-ADVANCE toggle, FULL LOG (opens Pause, which holds the game log) and START PLAYER PHASE.
 * What happens next is `settings.villainAutoAdvance` (`#syncTiming`):
 *  - "off" (default): nothing closes the recap on a timer; the player presses Start player phase (or Hide/Esc).
 *  - "afterPause": the recap closes itself after `VILLAIN_RECAP_PAUSE_MS`.
 *  - "on": no recap at all; the last beat gets one beat interval (`villainBeatIntervalMs`) and the screen closes.
 * Beats are revealed one per `villainBeatIntervalMs(villainBeatSpeed)`. The "before" half of the "what changed"
 * tiles is the game Board handed over at launch (`VillainPhaseLaunchData`). Because a whole phase can (and often
 * does) finish revealing between two store updates, `#syncTiming` re-checks from the reveal timer's own tick the
 * moment it catches up, not only from a fresh store update (a pre-2026-09-29 version hung there). Similarly, if
 * `state.game` disappears or the game ends (`state.game.outcome`), the scene stops itself without waiting to be told.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * REDUCED MOTION
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The whole reason this screen exists is that the engine can hand over an
 * entire five-step phase in one burst (`view/villain-walkthrough.ts`), so
 * normally beats are revealed one at a time on a readable timer
 * (`view/villain-phase-reveal.ts`). Under reduced motion there is no timer:
 * every beat currently known is shown the instant it arrives, up to the next
 * stop the player asked for (a facedown card's Flip Encounter Card, a held
 * card's Next card, #342), and the player reads at their own pace rather
 * than a timer's — "no travel/animation; the beats still appear and the
 * player can step through" is satisfied because nothing is gated behind a
 * wait, only behind the player's own reading speed and the controls, which
 * work identically either way.
