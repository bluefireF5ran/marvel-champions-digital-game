/**
 * The `?screen=board&fixture=shadowland` dev jump (`scenes/boot-dev-jump.ts`): a one-seat preset board state for looking
 * at what Shadowland puts on the board without playing a game up to it.
 * Spider-Man (Justice) against Shifting Corridors (Shadow Labyrinth's villain, with passage counters), the TRAP! cards
 * gathered into the separate "trap" scenario deck with a couple already in its own discard pile, Creeping Corruption
 * in play with corruption counters on it, and The Streets Below (the two position environments) in the villain area.
 * `?flip=1` flips them to Atop the Tenshu; `?corruption=N` sets the counter count (default 4); `?traps=N` sets how
 * many TRAP! cards are dealt (default 5, the most there are; two of them start in the discard).
 *
 * Dev builds only: the game is built with the cards package's own test builders (`trap-testing.ts`), loaded with
 * `import.meta.glob` the way `dev-mission-game.ts` loads its builder, and handed to a `DevStateHost`. It keeps no
 * storage and leaves the playable pool untouched.
