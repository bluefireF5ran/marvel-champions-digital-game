/**
 * How one synced record becomes what the server stores (issue #276, step 2). The server keeps an opaque key and an
 * opaque blob; the real name ("game:abc:meta", "db:decks:...") and the contents exist only on the devices.
 *
 *  - The stored key is an HMAC-SHA256 of the logical key under a key derived from the recovery code: deterministic,
 *    so every device finds the same record, and unlinkable to game or deck ids for anyone without the code.
 *  - The contents are JSON, gzipped (before encrypting, since ciphertext doesn't compress), then AES-256-GCM with a
 *    random 12-byte IV. The sealed JSON is `{ k: logicalKey, s: stamp, v: value }`, because a device pulling a record
 *    it has never seen holds only the server's record key. Two optional additions (mixed app versions): `w: { app,
 *    content }`, the build that sealed it, and `d`, a `db:` record's database version; a build older than the writer
 *    keeps the record untouched (`sync-engine.ts`). Records without them are fine. The record key is the GCM
 *    additional data, so a hostile or buggy server cannot hand back record A's ciphertext under record B's key, and
 *    opening checks that the logical key inside hashes to the record key it was stored under.
 *  - Layout, base64url: "MCS1" | iv(12) | ciphertext. One content key serves every record, which is safe because each
 *    seal uses a fresh random IV (a space holds far fewer than the 2^32 seals where random-IV collisions matter).
