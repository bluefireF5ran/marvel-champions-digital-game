/**
 * The real device-sync service for this app, built once: the saved recovery code in `localStorage`, this device's
 * save data in IndexedDB, and the sync Worker. `main.ts` calls `startDeviceSync` at boot; any screen reaches the same
 * object through `syncService()`.
 *
 * Game writes happen in the engine Web Worker, whose `notifySaveDataChanged` never reaches this thread, so the worker
 * posts a `saved` message once its writes have committed and `engine/worker-host.ts` relays it (reason "turn" for a
 * command that ended a turn). Decks and campaigns are written on this thread and notify for themselves. Every game-only
 * trigger still re-reads the whole snapshot (non-game records are hashed again): cheap at this size, not yet cached.
