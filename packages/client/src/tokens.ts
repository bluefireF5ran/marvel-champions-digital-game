 * are Phaser-style `0xRRGGBB` numbers with a `css` twin for the few DOM-backed
 * bits (rexUI's text input, the page background). Nothing here imports Phaser,
 * so view models and tests can read tokens without a canvas.
 *
 * The design decisions these tokens serve, from section 06 of that canvas:
 *  - One red per screen: `accent.heroRed` marks the single forward action
 *    (Continue / Start game / End turn) plus the live round chip. Nothing else.
 *  - Borders, not shadows: depth is border weight and ground swaps. The only
 *    shadow in the system is the red selection ring.
 *  - Dim, don't hide: illegal choices stay in place at `ink.illegal`.
 *  - Numbers before prose: anything recalculated each round is Bangers 17px+.
