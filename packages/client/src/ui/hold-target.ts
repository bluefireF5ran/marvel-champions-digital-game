/**
 * Wires a Phaser zone to the shared card gesture (`view/hold-gesture.ts`):
 * tap acts, press-and-hold or right-click inspects, and a sideways drag
 * scrolls when the caller says the zone sits in a scrollable row.
 *
 * One binder for the table's cards (`scenes/board/tap-target.ts`), the choice
 * sheet's option rows (`scenes/choice.ts`) and `McCardTile` (`ui/widgets.ts`),
 * which used to carry three copies of the same timer-and-flags code — and the
 * same phone bug in each.
 *
 * **A press outlives the zone it began on.** The board redraws whole on every
 * state change, every art arrival and every pixel the hand scrolls
 * (`HandScroll#scrollBy`), and a redraw destroys and recreates every zone —
 * under a finger that is still down. A gesture kept in the zone's own closure
 * therefore forgot itself mid-press: a hand scroll only kept going by
 * accident, and lifting the finger at the end of one tapped whichever card had
 * arrived under it. So the live press is kept per pointer, outside any zone,
 * and a zone that receives the rest of a press it never saw begin picks it up
 * from there: a drag carries on across whatever cards pass under it, and a
 * press is only ever a tap on a control with the same `key` it began on.
