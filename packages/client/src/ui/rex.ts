/**
 * The rexUI seam: the one file that reaches into the toolkit (PLAN.md Phase 4,
 * "UI toolkit: rexUI behind our own widget layer").
 *
 * **Two components imported directly, not the `RexUIPlugin`.** rexUI's normal
 * entry point is `templates/ui/ui-plugin.js`, which registers an `ObjectFactory`
 * covering the *entire* component library — every dialog, chart, spinner and
 * progress bar — whether or not a factory is ever called. Registering it to use
 * two components cost **1.1 MB** of the minified bundle (1.6 MB → 2.7 MB),
 * which is a poor trade for a game PLAN.md intends to package to mobile later,
 * and runs against Phase 4's own performance guardrails.
 *
 * Each rexUI component also ships its own module, and the factory it registers
 * is exactly `new Component(scene, config)` followed by `scene.add.existing(…)`
 * (see `templates/ui/textarea/Factory.js`). So constructing them directly is
 * not a workaround — it is the same call the factory would have made, minus the
 * library-wide registration. `add*` below is that one line, kept here so
 * `widgets.ts` reads the same as it did through the plugin.
 *
 * Nothing else in the app imports rexUI: scenes go through the `Mc*` widgets,
 * which is the seam that keeps the toolkit swappable.

/**
 * Clips `gameObject` to `maskGameObject`'s shape, in both renderers.
 *
 * **Why this exists rather than `gameObject.setMask(shape.createGeometryMask())`:**
 * that call is a silent no-op under WebGL in Phaser 4 — `Components.Mask#setMask`
 * only logs "This method is not supported in WebGL. Create a Mask filter
 * instead." and does nothing (`GeometryMask` became Canvas-only in v4; see the
 * v4.0 migration guide). The app runs WebGL (PLAN.md Phase 4, "Use the WebGL
 * renderer"), so anything masked that way never actually clips — every row a
 * `McVirtualList` draws rendered over whatever the scene drew before or after
 * it, unclipped, which read as "rows overlap everything above and below the
 * list."
 *
 * rexUI's own `SetMask` (`plugins/utils/mask/MaskMethods.js`) already branches
 * on render mode — a WebGL filter mask or a Canvas `GeometryMask` — and our
 * rexUI scroll panels (`McScrollPanel`'s `TextArea`) already clip correctly
 * through it, so this is the same helper, not a new one.
 *
 * `maskType: "world"` matches the external/world filter context, so the mask
 * shape's coordinates stay in world space — the same space `#layoutTrack`
 * (and every other caller) already draws the mask rect in.
