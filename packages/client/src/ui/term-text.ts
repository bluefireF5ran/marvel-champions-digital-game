/**
 * `McTermText` (guided mode G3b, `docs/guided-mode.md` §4): body copy with inline glossary terms,
 * each drawn with a dotted underline and backed by a hit area — hover-to-open on desktop, tap-to-open
 * on touch, both driven by `onTermOpen`/`onTermClose` (the caller owns the actual `McTooltip`, so one
 * tooltip instance can be shared across several `McTermText` blocks on the same screen).
 *
 * **Layout.** There's no Phaser rich-text object that mixes plain and decorated runs in one string, so
 * this lays words out itself: `view/term-text-model.ts` parses `[[id]]` / `[[id|label]]` markup into
 * text/term runs, this widget splits every text run on whitespace (keeping each word's own trailing
 * space, so a wrapped line never carries a stray leading gap) and a term run into one atomic word (a
 * term is never split mid-label), then greedily wraps at `width`, one `Phaser.GameObjects.Text` per
 * word — all one style (body/`typeRole.body`), so wrapping only ever needs to compare plain widths.
 *
 * **Touch hit height** (`tokens.ts`'s `hit.target`, 44px): a term's own line is body-sized (well under
 * 44px), so its zone is centered on the word but grown to at least `hit.target` tall, overlapping into
 * the line above/below rather than shrinking the type to fit a touch target.
 *
 * **Keyboard path.** `focusNext`/`activateFocused`/`blur` are a self-contained Tab-among-terms/Enter-
 * opens loop for a host that hasn't wired this block into a screen's own `focusOrder` yet (`view/focus.ts`)
 * — the dev demo (`scenes/term-text-demo.ts`) drives it directly. G4a, embedding this in the guide
 * callout, should fold these into the callout's own focus order instead of calling them itself; they're
 * kept here so this widget is independently testable-by-hand before that screen exists.
