/**
 * How overlays and screens come and go.
 *
 * Two shapes, both from the design's own rule that depth is border weight and
 * ground swaps, never shadows or motion for its own sake:
 *
 *  - **An overlay rises into place** (`enterOverlay`): its scrim fades in and
 *    its panels come up a few pixels while fading in, over `motion.overlayEnterMs`.
 *    Leaving (`exitOverlay`) is the reverse and shorter — the player has already
 *    decided — and only then does the scene stop.
 *  - **A screen gives way to the next** (`fadeScreenIn` / `goToScreen`): a short
 *    fade through the void, so Title → Scenario → Seats reads as pages turning
 *    rather than as a hard cut.
 *
 * Every scene here redraws its whole display list on every store update
 * (`destroyChildren`), and every overlay draws at least twice at open, because
 * `SessionStore.subscribe` delivers the current state immediately and `create`
 * draws once more itself. So the entrance is held as a *start time*
 * (`OverlayMotion`), the shape the Board's beats and travels already use: each
 * draw inside the entrance window re-creates the objects already partway along
 * and tweens the remainder, and a draw after the window lands opaque.
 * `OverlayMotion` also keeps the "already leaving" flag, so a second Escape
 * during the exit is ignored rather than stopping the scene twice.
 *
 * Reduced motion (`appSession().settings.reducedMotion`): nothing moves and
 * nothing fades; the overlay is simply there, and then simply gone. The
 * information is identical — that's the whole contract of the setting.
