/**
 * A virtualized, pixel-scrolling list of uniform-height rows — the Decks
 * screen's deck list, the deck builder's pool browser, and Title's scenario
 * and hero rosters (PLAN.md Phase 7 wave 1 client wiring; docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md
 * §2 "S8. Searchable, scrollable roster").
 *
 * **Recreated every scene rebuild, like every other non-DOM widget on these
 * screens** (buttons, labels, panels) — not persisted across
 * `destroyChildren(scene)` the way `McTextInput` is. An earlier version
 * tried to persist it (detach its root before the sweep, reattach after, the
 * `McTextInput` pattern), and that was the wrong pattern here: a DOM input
 * has to persist to keep browser focus and keystrokes, but this widget has
 * no such state, and reattaching its container put it at the *front* of the
 * new display list — ahead of everything the scene draws afterward in the
 * same rebuild (a "rail" background, a header, the next control) — so those
 * later elements rendered on top of the list instead of beside or behind it.
 * Recreating it fresh each rebuild, in the normal draw order, puts it back
 * where every other element on the screen already is: exactly where the
 * scene's own layout code placed it.
 *
 * **What does persist is the scroll position**, in a `ListScroll` the caller
 * owns and passes in (`ScrollOwner.scroll`) — a scene keeps one field across
 * rebuilds, unaffected by this widget being destroyed and recreated around
 * it. Within one widget's lifetime (between rebuilds), scrolling — wheel, the
 * scrollbar thumb, keyboard/pad paging — only recycles rows and moves one
 * transform; it never asks the scene to rebuild, which is what keeps it
 * smooth at any list size. The scene calls `update(count, renderRow)` when
 * the *data* changes (a filter, an import, a card added/removed).
 *
 * **Rows are recycled by index**, not rebuilt every frame: a row already
 * drawn for the current window (plus one row of overscan each side, so a row
 * scrolling in is already drawn before the mask exposes it — `ListScroll`'s
 * own `windowFor`) is left alone; only the shared row layer's `y` moves. A
 * row leaving the window is destroyed and one entering is drawn fresh via
 * `renderRow`.
 *
 * **Owns its own background panel**, painted first inside its own container,
 * so it is always behind its own rows regardless of what the scene draws
 * before or after it — the fix for the same "wrong element on top" family of
 * bug a scene-drawn background panel was exposed to.
 *
 * **Touch/mouse drag-to-scroll on the list body itself** (not just the
 * scrollbar thumb) is handled by scene-level pointer listeners — never a
 * `Zone` laid over the rows, which would swallow every row's own button —
 * filtered to this list's rect, and driven by the pure `DragGesture`/
 * `Momentum` classes (`view/drag-gesture.ts`) so the tap-vs-drag threshold
 * and momentum decay are unit-testable without a canvas. A pointer that
 * never moved past the threshold is a tap: `onRowActivate` fires for a row
 * with no button of its own to click (Title's rosters); a pointer that moved
 * is a drag, and its release seeds `Momentum`, decayed every frame until it's
 * negligible or a scroll at an end reports no movement (`Momentum.stop`).
 *
 * **A row's own buttons still need two things this file doesn't own but
 * makes possible**: `McButton`'s `clip` (a row reparented into the masked
 * layer is still fully hit-testable outside the mask — Phaser's masks are
 * visual only — so a row scrolled out of view, or the overscan row, must not
 * respond to a stray click) and `suppressClick` (the drag that just ended
 * must not also fire the button's own `pointerup`). `isDragSuppressingClick`
 * and `rect` below are what a caller wires a row's `McButton`s to.
