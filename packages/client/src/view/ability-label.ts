/**
 * A human name for one action ability on a card in play, for the board's
 * ability affordance and the Inspect picker (PLAN.md Phase 4, "Abilities on
 * cards in play are not reachable from the UI").
 *
 * `AbilityReference.label` — the printed sub-ability name, e.g. "Rechannel",
 * "Spider-Sense" — only exists "when the card names it" (`@mc/content`
 * `schema/abilities.ts`). Scanning every real Core game (Rhino solo, Klaw
 * 2-player, Ultron 4-player; see this file's test), no action ability that
 * ever reaches the player through `useAbility` carries one: the labeled ones
 * in Core content are all resource or interrupt/response abilities, consumed
 * as payment or triggers rather than tapped from the board. So the fallback
 * path below — the card's own name plus its cost, read straight off the
 * engine's `AbilityCost` — is what every real Core case uses today. This
 * still checks the printed label first, so a future card that does name an
 * action ability is named correctly rather than by its cost alone.
 *
 * Either way, nothing here is invented: every word traces back to
 * `AbilityReference.label`, `faceUpName`, or a field on `AbilityCost`.
