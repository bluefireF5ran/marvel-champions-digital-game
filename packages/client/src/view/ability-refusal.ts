/**
 * "Why can't I use this?" for an in-play ability the engine refused (docs/phase7-wave10-client.md 5.3: New Labors of
 * Hercules "a Labor card is in play", "the Labor deck is empty"). The engine's refusal for a `useAbility` whose `while`
 * is not met is one sentence for every such ability ("that ability cannot be triggered: its condition is not met"), so on
 * its own it cannot say which part failed. This module asks the engine which: each clause of the ability's own `while`
 * is a count the engine's `resolveValue` reads (a query's matches, a separate deck's size), and the first clause whose
 * count is not what it needs is worded from its own data. Anything it cannot word keeps the engine's sentence.
 *
 * What is the client's: the glue (a count of 0 is "none", an "at least k" compares to k) and the wording of the shapes
 * the printed conditions use. What is the engine's: every number. A condition shape not listed here is never guessed at.
 * (Owed to the engine: exporting `evaluate`, or a per-clause refusal message, would let this glue go.)
