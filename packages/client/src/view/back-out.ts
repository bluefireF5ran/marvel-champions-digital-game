/**
 * "Back out" (docs/wave4/back-out.md; the choice scene's own button): rewinds a game to the state just before the
 * local player's own `playCard`/`useAbility`, undoing everything that command's own resolution opened — a discard
 * choice, a target choice, whatever else — as if the player had never played it.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 has no such rule: an initiated ability or played card can't be taken back once it's started resolving.
 * This is a digital convenience, offered only in the one case where taking it back changes nothing the player
 * didn't already know — no card was drawn, revealed, looked at, or dealt in the meantime — so undoing it puts the
 * game back exactly where it stood, rather than letting a player peek at hidden information and then retreat from
 * a choice made worse by knowing it.
 *
 * The trail this reads (`BackOutTrailEntry[]`) is kept by `SessionStore` itself, one entry per command it has
 * successfully dispatched since the game started or was resumed — never recomputed from the engine, since the
 * whole point is remembering exactly what was learned and when.
