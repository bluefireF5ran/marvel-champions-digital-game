/**
 * The readable beats of a command: what just happened, and to what.
 *
 * The design's brief for motion is "enough to make state changes readable, not
 * spectacle for its own sake" (PLAN.md Phase 4). The thing a player actually
 * loses track of in a card game is not *that* the board changed but *where* —
 * four damage landing on a minion and four landing on your identity look
 * identical in a log line and completely different at the table.
 *
 * So a beat is a number and a place: "−4" over Rhino, "+2 THREAT" over the main
 * scheme, "STUNNED" over the minion that just got stunned. The Board tweens
 * them off their anchor and lets them go.
 *
 * This module is plain data — no Phaser, no positions. It says what to say and
 * which card to say it over; the scene knows where that card currently is.
