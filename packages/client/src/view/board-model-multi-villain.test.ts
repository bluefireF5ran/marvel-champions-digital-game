/**
 * `BoardModel` against a real Wrecking Crew Breakout game — four villains in play at once — for the bug reported
 * from play: the board built only `model.villain` (the active one), so Thunderball, Piledriver and Bulldozer were
 * in play with nothing drawn for them, discoverable only through the "Choose a target" sheet.
 *
 * The game is a real `SessionStore` session through the pool's own scenario builder (`content/pool.ts`'s
 * `buildScenario`, reached through `LocalEngineHost`/`session-core.ts` — never `@mc/cards`' `wave1Scenario`
 * called directly), the same way every other `board-model*.test.ts` proves the client against the actual engine
 * rather than a hand-built fixture. Moving the active counter and defeating a villain mid-scenario would need many
 * turns of real play to reach through commands alone, so those two are reached by editing the real `GameState` this
 * session produced (`activeVillainId`, `villains[n].defeated`) — `boardModel` is a pure function of `GameState`, so
 * this exercises exactly the same code a later `activeVillainChanged`/`characterDefeated` in real play would.
