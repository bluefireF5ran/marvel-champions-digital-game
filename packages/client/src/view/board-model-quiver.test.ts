/**
 * Hawkeye's Quiver: "You may play Arrow events attached to this card as if they were in your hand." The engine has
 * always offered such an Arrow as a legal play, but the table only draws the hand, and a play-area card tile draws no
 * attachments — so an Arrow the Quiver found was legal and drawn nowhere (2026-09-21 report). The board model now
 * carries it at the end of the hand strip, tagged with where it is (`HandCardView.from`).
 *
 * Real content, real commands: the Hawkeye (Leadership) precon against Rhino.
