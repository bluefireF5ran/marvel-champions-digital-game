/**
 * Tower Defense's own two main schemes and its Focused Defense attachment and Avengers Tower environment (`mts`
 * 21098a, MC21 p. 10: "Both main schemes are active each round"; docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.2). `BoardModel` used to
 * have no way to name a second main scheme at all, and `schemePanel`'s own "main scheme" branch read
 * `state.mainScheme` unconditionally regardless of which instance it was building a panel for, so a panel built
 * for the second main scheme would have drawn the first one's stage index and acceleration tokens instead of its
 * own. Also confirms Focused Defense itself — an attachment on a main scheme, a zone `SchemePanel` had no field
 * for before this wave — and damage on Avengers Tower — an environment `EnvironmentPanel` had no field for either
 * — actually show.
