/**
 * The board's zone jumps: LB / RB on a pad, `[` / `]` on a keyboard.
 *
 * The focus route (`view/focus.ts`) is one flat list, which is right for Tab but slow when the hand is nine cards long
 * and the thing you want is End turn. A zone jump hops to the first stop of the next zone, in the order a player's eye
 * travels the table: the hand, your own play area, the villain's side (villain, minions, schemes), the action bar.
 *
 * Zones are named by the cards in them (ids from the board model), not by where they were drawn, so the jump still knows
 * a card on a phone tab that is not showing: the board then switches to that tab before it lands. Zones with no stop on
 * the route right now (an empty hand, nothing in play with a usable ability) are skipped rather than landed on.
