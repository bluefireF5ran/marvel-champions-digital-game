  /**
   * The real bug this regression test reproduces (found clicking through the Aftermath, MC16 p. 15's Nebula
   * Victory): a per-seat field several instructions write in sequence in one node — "units" alone has three specs
   * — chains each `add` write onto the *previous* write's own running total, not onto zero
   * (`applyLogWrite`/`combine`, `engine/campaign/log.ts`). A multi-issue campaign also carries a nonzero baseline
   * into the node (units are the box's own currency, unspent across issues). Naively summing every `add` write for
   * a seat, as an earlier version of `aftermathLogTags` did, double-counts the chain *and* folds in whatever the
   * field already held — 1 (baseline) + 1 (spec 1) + 0 (spec 2) + 1 (spec 3) + 1 (spec 4), stored as the running
   * totals 2, 2, 3, 4, summed wrongly to 11. The fix reads only the last write per seat (4, the true running
   * total) and subtracts the logBefore baseline (1), landing on the real MC16 p. 15 max for an empty victory
   * display and an unthreatened main scheme: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3.
