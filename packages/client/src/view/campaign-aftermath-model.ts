/**
 * C05/C06 Aftermath's victory-choice groups (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §7, §10.2).
 *
 * `resolveBetweenGames`/`applyCampaignResult` ask one seat at a time — a later seat's options depend on an earlier
 * seat's pick (`excludeGranted`), so the runner can never offer every seat's choice in one call. The design shows
 * every seat's column at once (`Campaign - Desktop.dc.html`'s "EACH HERO TAKES ONE"), so this module is the pure
 * state that reconciles the two: an `AftermathChoiceGroup` remembers the printed choice's full option catalog (the
 * very first real prompt the engine returned, before anyone had picked anything) and every seat's own decision —
 * confirmed once the engine has actually accepted it, local until then. A seat the engine hasn't reached yet is
 * shown the catalog minus whatever any other seat has already decided, its options marked "taken" rather than
 * removed, exactly as the common brief asks.
 *
 * **Nothing here invents an answer.** `offersAnswer` is the guard a caller runs before sending a locally-decided
 * pick to a real `fold`/`compose` call: if the engine's real prompt doesn't actually offer what the UI guessed, the
 * caller surfaces the mismatch instead of sending it — this module only ever proposes what `answerFor` derives
 * from a seat's own recorded decision, never a synthesized one.
