/**
 * The deck-edit gate (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §10.2, `campaign-deck-edit-model.ts`): a campaign seat's deck,
 * as the builder screen shows it — wrapping `validateDeck(deck, pool, { campaign })` rather than re-deriving any
 * of its verdicts, and marking which rows are campaign grants and whether editing is frozen at all.
 *
 * **Assembling `CampaignDeckContext` is this module's other half.** `@mc/engine` holds neither a box name nor a
 * campaign log (design §8's own header: the engine "holds neither and never names a box"), so a caller supplies
 * the `@mc/content` `Campaign` record and the seat's `CampaignLog` column, and `campaignDeckContextOf` folds them
 * into the shape `validateDeck` reads. `frozenNonCampaignCards` (MC16 p. 5 / MC27 p. 6) has no generic source in
 * `CampaignLog` — it is a box's own rule about *when* a deck freezes, not campaign state — so it is an explicit,
 * optional input here; MC10 never freezes a deck, so its own tests never pass one.
