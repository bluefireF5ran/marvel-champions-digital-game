/**
 * The Market (MC16 p. 5, `packages/cards/src/campaigns/gmw.ts`'s `marketShoppingSetup`): a between-games shopping
 * trip built from `choose`/`spend`/`grantCard` triples, one price tier's remaining cards at a time.
 *
 * **Detected by shape, not by `campaignId`.** `isMarketPendingChoice` calls a `CampaignPendingChoice` a Market
 * purchase when every option it offers prices in the campaign's currency field (`PlayerCardCommon.unitCost`) — a
 * spend/grant purchase over a currency field, exactly the shape CLAUDE.md asks this screen to key off. A later
 * campaign that reuses the same `choose`/`spend`/`grantCard`-over-`unitCost` shape gets this screen for free,
 * without this file ever naming GMW.
 *
 * **The runner only ever asks one price tier at a time, but the shelf sells the whole stall.** `marketShoppingSetup`
 * asks tier 1's up-to-4 slots before it ever asks tier 2's, so `CampaignPendingChoice.options` — narrowed by
 * `resolveChoiceSource`'s `campaignSet`/`unitCostExactly`, `packages/engine/src/campaign/ops.ts` — only ever shows
 * the current tier. A player standing in front of a real market stall with 5 units in their pocket does not need to
 * be told "come back later" for a 2-unit card just because the shopkeeper is working through the 1-unit bin first —
 * so this view widens "clickable" to every catalog card the active seat can currently afford, not just
 * `pending.options`. `marketViewOf` still never invents a legal move: affordability is the same running-balance
 * arithmetic the engine itself would apply (`fieldAtLeast units tier`, checked against `before` minus every
 * committed purchase this visit minus the seat's own uncommitted cart), and nothing is ever granted client-side —
 * see "Checkout" below.
 *
 * **The cart, and checkout.** Because the engine only ever asks for the *current* tier, a seat's shopping list has
 * to be held somewhere until the runner is ready to hear about each item — that somewhere is a client-side cart
 * (`MarketCartItem[]`, held by `scenes/campaign/market.ts`, never persisted, never sent to the engine as one of its
 * own concepts). Adding or removing a card from the cart calls this model's `canAddToCart`/`cartTotalOf` and never
 * touches `CampaignChoiceAnswer` at all. "Done shopping" is what turns the cart into engine answers: the scene
 * drives the runner's own tier-by-tier questions, and for each one it offers, answers with a cart card of that
 * exact price if the cart still holds one (removing it from the cart), or declines otherwise. Because the cart never
 * lets its running total exceed the seat's `before` balance (`canAddToCart`), every tier-ascending prefix of the
 * cart's total is provably affordable at the point the runner asks for it — the engine's own `fieldAtLeast` guard
 * cannot fail partway through a checkout. `marketShoppingSetup`'s 4-slots-per-tier cap is enforced here too
 * (`MARKET_TIER_CAP`), so the cart can never ask the runner for a 5th card of the same price.
 *
 * A seat's cart only exists while that seat is the runner's active `eachSeat` chooser; once checkout empties it (or
 * moves the runner on to the next seat), a fresh empty cart starts for whoever the runner asks next — the physical
 * stall closes out one shopper's whole basket before ringing up the next (MC16 p. 5's own "repeat this process as
 * many times as you wish").
