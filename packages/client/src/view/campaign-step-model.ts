/**
 * The between-scenario step (docs/campaign-mode-design.md §10.2, `campaign-step-model.ts`): rendering what
 * `resolveBetweenGames`/`applyCampaignResult` did or are asking about, and carrying a composed log the rest of
 * the way to a playable game and back.
 *
 * Four jobs, none of which reimplements a rule:
 *  - `campaignStepRows` renders a resolved `CampaignStepTrace[]` (`CampaignAttempt.steps` mid-composition, or a
 *    `CampaignHistoryEntry.steps` once folded) into the between-games step list design §10.2 asks for: each
 *    instruction's printed `text` + `citation` + what it actually did.
 *  - `campaignChoicePrompt` is a thin, explicitly-named wrapper over `CampaignPendingChoice` — the shape a re-entry
 *    loop (`../engine/campaign-storage.ts`'s consumer) hands to a chooser UI, options and all, never computed here.
 *  - `campaignLaunchConfig` turns a composed log (`resolveBetweenGames`'s `"done"` result) into the `SessionConfig`
 *    the existing host path already knows how to start (design §7's boundary: `startGameFromLog`'s
 *    `CampaignGameInput` goes onto `SessionConfig.campaign` unchanged, so a saved campaign game replays without
 *    ever consulting the live log again).
 *  - `campaignPostGameFold` composes `campaignResultOf` + `applyCampaignResult` — the read-the-finished-game,
 *    write-the-log half of the same boundary — so a caller never has to get the two-call order right by hand.
