/**
 * "This card, this game" — a per-instance trace, for the Inspect overlay (D08,
 * P14; docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 "W8": "Inspect: 'This card, this game':
 * where the card has been, from the game log").
 *
 * `view/log-lines.ts`'s `LogState` is deliberately narrower than this needs: it
 * drops the bookkeeping events (a card drawn, a card discarded from hand to pay
 * a cost) that never earn a line on the shared table log, because a whole-table
 * log that announced every draw would be unreadable. A single card's own
 * history is exactly the opposite ask — "where has *this* card been" wants the
 * draw and the discard-to-pay too — so this is a second, parallel fold over the
 * same event stream, kept by `scenes/board.ts` for as long as the Board scene
 * itself lives (i.e., the whole session; overlays launch on top of it, never
 * replacing it). It reuses `logLine`'s exact wording for every event the two
 * folds share, so a card's history never disagrees with what the table log
 * already said about it.
 *
 * One entry per *command* (one call to `appendCardHistory`), not per event —
 * "played, dealt 6, defeated" is one beat at the table, so it is one line here
 * too, in the mono round tag the design prints ("2.04" — round 2, the 4th beat
 * of that round). A resumed game's history starts empty from the point of
 * resume, the same limitation `LogState` already has and for the same reason:
 * neither is reconstructed from the saved log, only accumulated forward.
