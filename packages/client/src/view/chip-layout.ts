/**
 * Wrapping a row of quick-filter chips (S8) so every label reads in full at
 * phone width, instead of the equal-width single row `#drawChoiceRow` and
 * `title-layout.ts` used before: 8 hero chips ("Aggression", "Justice",
 * "Leadership", "Protection", "Precon", "Imported", "Built", "Playable now")
 * in one row at a ~340px phone column gave each chip about 40px, and
 * `McButton`'s own `fitText` (`ui/widgets.ts`) can only shrink a label from
 * 9px down to `CAPTION_FLOOR` (8px) before it falls back to truncating with
 * "…" — nowhere near enough range to fit "Leadership" or "Playable now" in
 * 40px, so every chip truncated.
 *
 * This module decides *how many rows* a chip strip needs, not how a chip
 * looks — drawing stays `scenes/title.ts`'s `#drawChoiceRow`, one call per
 * row this module returns. It's plain TypeScript (no live Phaser scene, no
 * canvas), so "would this label fit" is answered with a deliberately
 * conservative width estimate rather than a real text measurement — the same
 * trade `title-layout.ts`'s own doc comment makes for row heights, for the
 * same reason (a pure function a test can check without a canvas).
