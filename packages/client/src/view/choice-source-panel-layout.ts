/**
 * Where the choice sheet's source-card panel sits, pure geometry.
 *
 * Two shapes, chosen by form factor alone (mirroring `inspect-layout.ts`'s own "panels vs sheet" split, which draws
 * the same distinction for the same reason — width to spare beside a centered panel, or not):
 *
 *  - **Rail** (desktop, tablet landscape): a full card-sized panel to the left of the decision sheet, the pair
 *    centered together as one group — the same composition Inspect's D08 pair uses for its card/rules panels.
 *  - **Strip** (phone, phone landscape, tablet portrait): there is no width to spare beside the sheet at these
 *    sizes, so a compact horizontal strip sits *inside* the sheet, above its title bar's content — a thumbnail,
 *    the name and ability line, and rules text capped at the design's own table line count (`RULES_TEXT_TABLE_LINES`).
 *
 * `railReserve`/`stripReserve` say how much room the caller has to carve out of its own layout *before* asking for
 * a placement — `sourceRailPlacement`/`sourceStripPlacement` only ever place a panel inside room already given to
 * them, the same "the scene measures, this file only lays out" split `inspect-layout.ts` keeps.
