/**
 * Names the *source* of a pending choice — the card, and where it can be
 * pinned down exactly, the ability — for the choice sheet's header.
 *
 * Reported bug: every `chooseTarget` prompt titled itself "Choose a target"
 * with no hint of which card was asking. After paying for Doctor Strange's
 * Spell Mastery, a bare sheet appeared with no mention of Crimson Bands of
 * Cyttorak; the same for a basic attack/thwart's own target choice. The
 * engine sends `ChoicePrompt`'s `chooseTarget.abilityId` as `null` for every
 * effect-driven target choice (`packages/engine/src/resolve/effects-frame.ts`),
 * so the fix has to come from somewhere else the prompt already points to:
 * `PendingChoice.frameId`, which names a frame on `GameState.stack`
 * (`packages/engine/src/stack.ts`).
 *
 * Built without an engine change (a concurrent session owns `packages/engine`
 * right now) — every field this module reads already exists:
 *  - `payForCard`/`payForAbility` name their own `instanceId`/`abilityId`
 *    directly on the prompt. Full fidelity, always.
 *  - `declareDefender` names the attacking enemy on `prompt.attack`.
 *  - a `window` frame (`chooseTriggers`/`orderTriggers`, or a card paying its
 *    own cost inside a timing window) names its candidate's instance and
 *    ability directly (`StackFrame` "window", `paying`/`pending`/`queue`).
 *  - an `effects` frame (`chooseTarget`, `chooseCards`, `choosePlayer`,
 *    `chooseOption`, a `chooseAttachmentTarget` raised mid-ability) names
 *    `selfInstanceId` — the card whose ability's effects are running — but
 *    *not* which of that card's abilities it is. See "KNOWN GAP" below.
 *  - `enemyAttack`/`enemyScheme`/`reveal`/`playCard` frames name the
 *    activating/revealed/played card directly (`playCard` also names
 *    `triggeredAbilityId` when the play was itself the answer to a window).
 *
 * KNOWN GAP, for `game-rules-architect`/`ability-scripting-engineer`: a
 * `chooseTarget`/`chooseCards`/`choosePlayer` prompt raised from inside a
 * card with *more than one* currently active ability can only be traced back
 * to the card, never the specific ability, because the "effects" `StackFrame`
 * (`packages/engine/src/stack.ts`) carries `selfInstanceId` but no
 * `AbilityId` — `resolve/ability.ts`'s `executeAbilityFrame` pops the
 * `"ability"` frame (which does carry `abilityId`) *before* pushing the
 * effects frame that runs its effects, and `resolve/frames.ts`'s
 * `pushEffects` has no field to carry it through even if it wanted to. This
 * is the actual reason every `chooseTarget` call site hardcodes
 * `abilityId: null` (`resolve/effects-frame.ts`, `resolve/defeat.ts`) even
 * though `ChoicePrompt`'s `chooseTarget` variant already reserves the field.
 * A card with exactly one live ability isn't ambiguous (there is nothing
 * else it could be), so this module still names the ability in that — the
 * overwhelmingly common — case; only a card with two or more live abilities
 * degrades to the card name alone. The precise, minimal engine fix: add
 * `abilityId: AbilityId | null` to the `"effects"` `StackFrame`, set from
 * `Frame<"ability">.abilityId` in `executeAbilityFrame` just before it pops
 * that frame, threaded through `pushEffects`'s spec; then have
 * `requestTargetChoice` and `resolve/effects-frame.ts`'s other two
 * `chooseTarget` call sites read it off the frame instead of `null`.
