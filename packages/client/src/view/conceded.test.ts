/**
 * A conceded game, through every client reader of `outcome.result`.
 *
 * `GameOutcome` gained a third kind (`{ result: "conceded", reason: "playerConceded", byPlayerId }`) and all four
 * readers were ternaries, which the type checker cannot flag: each would silently have read a concession as a defeat.
 * This is the test that holds them, so a fifth reader added later has something to fail against.
 *
 * There is no RRG page here on purpose: the rules reference has no concede rule at all (see `Command`'s own note in
 * `@mc/engine`), so conceding is a digital-implementation affordance and what follows is the product decision —
 * a concession is presented as a concession, never as a loss.
