/**
 * Choosing an either/or cost branch, or how many counters an "up to N" cost removes — made up front, like every
 * other cost pick (RRG 1.8 "Initiating Abilities", p. 24, step 5; docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.32, §3.36). `legalActions`
 * offers the payable branches (`LegalAction.costBranches`) and the counter range (`LegalAction.costCounters`), but
 * `example` only ever answers with the engine's own default (the first payable branch; the most counters) — the
 * same gap `discard-choice-model.ts` fills for a "discard N cards" cost, mirrored here for these two.
 *
 * The branch labels are drawn straight from the ability's own printed `AbilityCost` shape (a small, generic
 * describer covering the handful of cost kinds cycle 2 actually combines in an `either`), not restated as prose
 * anywhere else — so a new `either` cost the pool adds later still gets a legible label with no client change,
 * as long as its branches use vocabulary this file already knows.
