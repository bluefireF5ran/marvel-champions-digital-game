/**
 * Opting into a play-cost reduction while paying for a card (docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.20; Star-Lord's "What could
 * go wrong?", `stld` 17001a: "Interrupt: When you play a card from your hand, deal yourself 1 facedown encounter
 * card → reduce the cost to play that card by 3. (Limit once per round.)"). The engine only prices this reduction
 * when it is named on the command itself (`playCard.costReductionAbilities`) — never guessed for the player the
 * way an ordinary payment source is (`legal.ts`'s own doc comment: "Choosing to use it when it is not needed is
 * the client's to offer"). Without this the ability is unusable outside the one case where it is the *only* way to
 * afford the card at all (`legalActions`' own `example` already finds that case unassisted).
 *
 * This module finds which reductions the player could offer to use on a card in hand, and builds + validates the
 * reduced command once they ask for one. The offer is a client-side scan over public engine queries, not a
 * restatement of the rule: whether a reduction is *truly* usable (its own cost payable, its limit not reached, its
 * card filter matched) is still the engine's own call, made for real when the reduced command is tried
 * (`applyCommand`, exactly as every other command this app sends is judged).
