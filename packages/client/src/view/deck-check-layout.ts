/**
 * Deck check's own layout (W1, docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 "Deck check
 * screen"; rebuilt 2026-09-18 for the owner's fidelity note — "The 'Deck
 * Check' screens and elements there don't flow well with the design."
 *
 * **The desktop canvas for this step is D04, "Deck builder — live validation
 * against the 40–50 rule"** (`artifacts/design-screenshots/individual/screens-desktop.dc/04-s04.png`):
 * an ink top bar (Bangers "◂ SEATS", the Bangers "HERO — ASPECT" title, a
 * green/red filled "N CARDS · LEGAL" badge at the right) over a full-width
 * three-column body — a ~230px parchment rail (aspect, filter, cost curve at
 * its own foot), the card grid in the middle, and a ~300px full-height ink
 * rail (the deck list, then its own footer actions) on the right. The old
 * version of this file read D04's *absence* from the phone canvas set as
 * license to invent an unrelated two-column shape; it wasn't — D04 **is**
 * this screen's own desktop composition, just drawn read-only here (the
 * aspect tiles and cost curve are informational rather than editable, the
 * grid shows the deck's *own* cards rather than the whole legal pool, and
 * the right rail's footer holds "Edit deck"/"Start game ▸" rather than
 * "Preconstructed"/"Clear") — the same relationship `scenes/deck-builder.ts`
 * already has to this canvas (its own doc comment reads the identical
 * three-column split), so both screens draw the *same* composition rather
 * than two different guesses at it.
 *
 * **Wide (desktop/tabletLandscape): three columns**, matching
 * `scenes/deck-builder.ts`'s own `LEFT_RAIL_WIDTH`/`RIGHT_RAIL_WIDTH`/
 * `RAIL_GAP` so the two screens' columns line up pixel-for-pixel when a
 * player moves between them. `rail` (left, `RAIL_WIDTH`): the deck's aspect
 * tiles, the type filter chips (filtering `cards`, not editing the deck),
 * and the cost curve pinned at the rail's own foot. `cards` (middle,
 * flexible): the deck's own card grid. `panel` (right, `PANEL_WIDTH`, full
 * height, ink): the deck list, with Edit deck (quiet) and Start game ▸ (the
 * screen's one red action) pinned at its own foot.
 *
 * **Narrow (phone/tabletPortrait): one column**, P04's own shape unchanged —
 * a Curve/Cards/Aspect tab strip under a "YOUR DECK · N" header (not the
 * wide header's hero name/legality badge — P04 draws its own, simpler
 * header, and this stays a deliberate per-form-factor difference rather than
 * forcing one header shape at every width), whichever tab's content, then a
 * footer ink bar (Edit deck, Start game ▸).
