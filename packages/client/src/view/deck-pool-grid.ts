/**
 * Pure grid geometry for Decks & Collection's "Card pool" column (W9b, D14):
 * how many columns fit at a given pane width, each cell's own rect, and which
 * column a pointer landed in — so `scenes/decks.ts` can render the pool
 * through `McVirtualList` (each "row" of the virtualized list is one row of
 * the grid, so vertical scrolling comes for free) without doing this
 * arithmetic inline, and the geometry itself is Vitest-testable without a
 * canvas.
 *
 * **Cell shape, deliberately not the mock's own box shape.** D14's HTML mock
 * lays out `image-slot` placeholders with no true aspect ratio of their own
 * (`flex:1;min-height:0` — whatever height the grid row happens to be) next
 * to a fixed caption band. A real scan has a real shape (2.5:3.5, the
 * printed card's own ratio — `art/card-art.ts`'s `drawArt` already draws
 * every card at it with `"contain"`), so stretching it to the mock's
 * arbitrary box would crop or distort actual art. This module draws the art
 * area at the card's own ratio and adds a fixed caption band under it, which
 * is a deliberate, documented fidelity trade in favor of legible art over
 * matching an unstyled placeholder's proportions.
