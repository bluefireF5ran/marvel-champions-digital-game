/**
 * Decks & Collection's own layout (W9b, docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3, D14),
 * as a pure function — same "layout function a plain-TS test can check for
 * overlap" every other screen's own layout module already does.
 *
 * **The composition, read straight off D14's own markup** (`ScreensDesktop_12`/
 * `_13`.png plus `Marvel Champions game screens/Screens - Desktop.dc.html`'s
 * `#s14`, docs/design-reference.md): an ink chrome bar (Back, "DECKS &
 * COLLECTION") over a paper ground. Below it, three columns, full body
 * height:
 *  - **"YOUR DECKS"** (`listPane`): a scrollable list of deck cards — the
 *    *selected* one drawn ink-filled with paper text (and, only for the
 *    selected deck, a second "last played · record" line), an illegal/WIP
 *    deck drawn with a red border and red title, everything else plain white
 *    on ink border, then a dashed "+ NEW DECK" tile as the list's own last
 *    row — followed by a fixed parchment "IMPORT / EXPORT" box.
 *  - **"CARD POOL"** (`poolPane`): a filter-chip row, then a grid of the
 *    selected deck's own legal card pool (art, a cost pip, name, and "Type ·
 *    X of Y in deck").
 *  - **The stats rail** (`statsPane`), on the same dark ink ground the mock
 *    draws it on: the deck's name/count/legality, curve, composition,
 *    "Recently changed", and a footer of DUPLICATE + the single red "PLAY
 *    THIS DECK ▸" — D14's own bottom two controls, side by side.
 *
 * **What's deliberately not the mock, and why** (`scenes/decks.ts`'s own doc
 * comment has the rest): the mock's Import/Export box carries no visible
 * controls, only description text — this build already has paste-import,
 * MarvelCDB-import and export, so those controls are folded into that box
 * rather than dropped. The mock's deck note and "N of N cards owned" line are
 * both skipped per docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §4 (advice text and owned-card
 * tracking are undecided/out of scope), and S8's search field and quick-filter
 * chips (added to this screen after D14 was drawn, as the deck pool grew past
 * a fixed list) sit above the deck list rather than being invented by the
 * mock.
 *
 * **Wide (desktop only): three panes side by side.** D14 needs real room for
 * a five-column card-pool grid alongside a 260–320px deck list and a
 * 280–360px stats rail; `tabletLandscape` (as narrow as 768px) doesn't have
 * it, so — unlike this screen's own two-pane version before W9b, which
 * treated `tabletLandscape` as wide — three columns are reserved for
 * `formFactor === "desktop"` (>=1280px) alone.
 *
 * **Narrow (phone/both tablet orientations): one column, via a three-way
 * "Decks"/"Cards"/"Stats" tab strip**, the same tab-scoped pattern P04 Deck
 * check already uses for its own Curve/Cards/Aspect tabs — one column stacking
 * all three groups would either give each too little height to be usable, or
 * push the footer actions off a short viewport with no scroll
 * (`title-layout.ts`'s own doc comment documents hitting exactly that at
 * 800×600 for a shorter page than this one).
