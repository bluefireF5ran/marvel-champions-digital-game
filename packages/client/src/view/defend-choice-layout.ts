/**
 * Where the dedicated defend sheet's sections sit (W6, docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md).
 *
 * Composition, read off the rendered canvases (docs/design-reference.md) rather than guessed:
 *  - **Desktop (D10)**: an ink title bar ("Villain Phase · Step N — X activates against you", authority on the
 *    right), a cream incoming-attack card, a row of cream option cards side by side under "Your options", and a
 *    right-hand ink rail — "The Stack" above, "Waiting on" below it, Confirm at the rail's own width, not the
 *    sheet's.
 *  - **Phone (P15)**: the same sections stacked full-width top to bottom, options as rows rather than a side-by-side
 *    row (there is no width to spare), Confirm full-width at the thumb.
 *  - **Tablet landscape**: desktop's two-column split; the board's own team rail stays legible behind the sheet at
 *    that width (L02's own rule for an interrupt over the table), so this sheet does not claim the *entire* viewport
 *    the way the phone sheet does — see `sheet` below.
 *
 * Pure geometry, no text measurement — same rule every other layout module in this package states for itself
 * (`title-layout.ts`, `overlay-layout.ts`): a caller can test it without a live Phaser scene.
