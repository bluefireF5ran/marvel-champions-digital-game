/**
 * Choosing which — and how many — hand cards pay a "discard N cards from
 * your hand" cost, as the player's own decision.
 *
 * `legalActions`'s `example` command always carries a *legal* answer to a
 * `discardFromHand` cost, but only the smallest one: `min` cards, chosen by
 * the engine's own tie-break (`legal.ts`'s `discardPicks`, cheapest first).
 * For a fixed "discard 1" that is merely a placeholder pick (RRG "Cost": the
 * player chooses which card, not the engine) — and for a cost like Shield
 * Toss's "discard X cards … deal 4 damage to X enemies" (`03006`, min 0, no
 * cap) the count itself is the whole decision, so defaulting to the minimum
 * silently answers "zero" and the ability does nothing. This is PLAN.md
 * Phase 7's "known missing pickers for in-play costs, where `legal.ts`
 * auto-fills one default candidate."
 *
 * Modeled on `payment-model.ts`: a mode over the hand, tracked as which
 * candidates are picked, with the engine's own `applyCommand` as the only
 * judge of whether a selection is legal — never a rule restated here. The
 * one thing this module decides itself is *which hand cards are worth
 * offering at all* (every hand card but the ability's own source, the same
 * predicate `legal.ts`'s `discardPicks` already uses), which is data the
 * client already has in full for its own hand and needs no engine query for.
