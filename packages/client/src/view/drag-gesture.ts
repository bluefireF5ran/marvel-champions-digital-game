 *
 * Two small pieces, used together by `ui/virtual-list.ts`:
 * - `DragGesture` tracks one pointer's motion from press to release and
 *   decides "was this a tap or a drag" and the release velocity.
 * - `Momentum` takes that velocity and decays it every frame into a scroll
 *   delta, until it's negligible or the list clamps at an end (the caller
 *   stops it there — see `Momentum.stop`).
