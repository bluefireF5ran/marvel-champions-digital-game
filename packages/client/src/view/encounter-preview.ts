/**
 * S3 (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §2): the encounter deck a table setup would
 * build — broken down by set and by card type — plus the nemesis sets held
 * back and the obligations shuffled in. Used by W2's Table setup screen
 * ("The encounter deck you're building").
 *
 * **This calls the same builder the game uses, not a re-derivation of the
 * list.** `coreScenario`/`wave1Scenario` (`@mc/cards`) already build the
 * exact `GameSetupConfig` — `encounterDeck`/`villains[].encounterDeck` — a
 * real game starts from (`session-core.ts`'s `scenarioFor`), and doing so is
 * side-effect-free: it's plain data assembly from static content (no RNG, no
 * `GameState`, no player interaction), so a preview can call it directly.
 * `encounterDeckPreviewOf` takes that config as input rather than importing
 * `@mc/cards` itself, so a caller (or a test) builds it with `coreScenario`/
 * `wave1Scenario` exactly as `session-core.ts` does, and this module only
 * ever reads the result.
 *
 * **What `coreScenario`/`wave1Scenario` *don't* cover:** each hero's
 * obligation card and nemesis set. RRG 1.8 Appendix II shuffles those in
 * during `createGame`'s own setup (`packages/engine/src/setup.ts`), which is
 * a real `GameState` build (instances, RNG-seeded shuffling) — not something
 * a preview should run just to read two fields. Both facts are printed data
 * on the identity itself (`HeroIdentityCard.obligationCardId`,
 * `nemesisEncounterSetId`), the same two fields W2's own hero detail panel
 * reads directly (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 W2). So this module reads
 * them straight off each seat's identity card rather than re-running setup —
 * no engine change needed, and no rule is restated: "which card is the
 * obligation" and "which set is the nemesis set" are the identity's own
 * printed values, not a computed rule.
 *
 * **A card in more than one of the sets used here would count in more than
 * one bucket of `bySet`.** No Core or wave 1 encounter card actually does
 * this (`encounterSetIds` is single-membership throughout today's pool), so
 * `bySet`'s counts already sum to `totalCards` in every scenario this module
 * is tested against — but the shape doesn't assume it stays that way.
