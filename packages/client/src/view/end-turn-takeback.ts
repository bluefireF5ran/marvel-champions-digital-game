/**
 * "Nevermind" after End turn (the owner, 2026-10-24): a fat-fingered End turn, or one pressed before a last look at the
 * hand, can be taken back while nothing has been shown that the player could use to play differently.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 has no take-back (a turn that has ended has ended; "Player Phase", p. 17-18, and "End of Player Phase"
 * steps 1 to 5, p. 18): this is a digital convenience in the same family as Undo (`view/undo.ts`) and rewinds the
 * same way, `SessionStore.rewindTo`, which replays the stored baseline and the commands before End turn. Everything
 * End turn resolved ("at the end of the turn" lasting effects expiring, the end-of-phase discard and refill, the
 * villain phase) therefore never happened, and happens again, in full, if the player ends the turn again.
 *
 * Three windows, one rule each, in the order a player meets them:
 *
 * - **Handover** (another hero's turn follows): the End turn command did nothing but pass the turn on. It is taken
 *   back from the Undo button on the next hero's turn (`handoverTakebackOf`, offered by `BoardController#undoOffer`).
 * - **The end-of-phase discard sheet** (the last hero ended the player phase; RRG 1.8 "End of Player Phase" step 1,
 *   p. 18, "Discard any cards?"): End turn has only asked the question, nothing is drawn or revealed, so the sheet
 *   offers Nevermind (`choiceTakebackOf`, `scenes/choice.ts`).
 * - **Villain phase gate** (the same End turn, after its discards): the engine runs the end of the player phase and the
 *   villain phase inside the command that answers the last discard (or End turn itself, with an empty hand), but the
 *   docked phase holds every beat back until START VILLAIN PHASE (`scenes/villain-phase.ts`, `#gateEligible`). Until
 *   that press the player has been shown only the hand refill, so `gateTakebackOf` offers Nevermind there. Once START
 *   is pressed the phase has been revealed and the window is gone.
 *
 * The refill draw is the one thing a player has seen by the gate (the hand on the board, "you drew 3 cards: ..."), and it
 * DOES reveal the top of the deck: a player who backs out knows the next cards and can play differently. It happens inside
 * the command that begins the villain phase, so a gate that closed before it could not exist. A replay draws the same
 * cards again (a deck that had to reshuffle spends the RNG and closes the window), so nothing is re-rolled, only
 * previewed. Whether that preview is acceptable is an owner call, not an RRG one (RRG 1.8 has no take-back at all):
 * the owner chose strict (2026-10-24), so `TAKEBACK_AFTER_OWN_DRAW` is false and the gate closes whenever a card was
 * drawn; the discard sheet is before every draw and is unaffected.
 *
 * The discard sheet and the gate are offered only to the seat that pressed End turn (`perspectiveId`): "back to my turn"
 * is wrong from another seat, which would be rewinding someone else's decision. The handover is the exception by
 * construction (it is the NEXT hero's bar that offers it, one person playing every seat), and it says "Nevermind", not
 * "back to my turn". Every window also refuses a command that spent the
 * RNG (`usedRandomness`, the same gate as Undo). The gate shares its last command with the villain phase, whose own
 * RNG use (an encounter reshuffle, say) is hidden behind the gate and cannot be told apart from the refill's; that
 * entry is therefore exempt, an engine-specific limitation. A replay reproduces that use identically either way.
