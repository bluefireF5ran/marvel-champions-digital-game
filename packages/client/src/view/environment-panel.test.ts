/**
 * Environment cards on the board, against a real Risky Business game.
 *
 * Criminal Enterprise lives in `state.villainArea` and gates the whole scenario — Norman Osborn takes no damage,
 * his infamy counters do — but it is neither a character nor a scheme, so until now the board had no panel that
 * could hold it and drew nothing at all. A player attacking a villain whose HP never moves has to be able to see
 * the number that does.
