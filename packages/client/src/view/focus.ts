/**
 * What keyboard focus moves through on the board, and in what order.
 *
 * A canvas has no focus order of its own — there is no DOM to tab through — so
 * the order is stated here rather than emerging from the draw calls. Keeping it
 * a pure function means the order is testable, and that it cannot quietly
 * change because someone reordered two `#draw` calls (PLAN.md Phase 4,
 * accessibility: "full keyboard and gamepad navigation with a visible focus
 * ring").
 *
 * The order follows the table, bottom-up, because that is the order a player
 * thinks in: the cards in your hand, then the actions you could take with them,
 * then the one control that ends your turn.
