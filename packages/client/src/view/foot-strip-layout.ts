/**
 * How tall a foot strip (the ink bar carrying a card's `▶` ability line, a note or a threat line) needs to be for
 * its text. A line that does not fit on one row wraps to a second line and the strip grows to hold it, rather than
 * ending in an ellipsis ("▶ SKIN CONT…" for Skin Contact). The strip names the ability, it never carries its rules
 * text (that is the Inspect pop-up's job), so it holds two lines at the caption size and, only when a name needs more
 * than two, a third at one size step smaller ("Psychogenetic Compatibility" and "I feel a storm coming..." in the
 * narrowest identity column used to end in an ellipsis). A fourth line is never drawn: that much text is Inspect's.
 *
 * Widths are estimates (the scene wraps with the real font metrics and only reads these to reserve height), kept a
 * little high on purpose so the strip is never reserved too short.
