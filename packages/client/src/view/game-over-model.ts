/**
 * What the game-over screen says, derived from the game.
 *
 * The design canvases (Screens - Desktop #12, Phone P11 / P17) put a story on
 * this screen — the final blow, the villain's standing, the rounds where it
 * turned — and note beside it "derived from the game log, no hidden information
 * used". This module is that derivation, and nothing on the screen is written
 * anywhere else: every sentence is built from the `GameRecord` the host folded
 * from the game's events, plus the final state. Where the record doesn't know
 * something (who a villain-phase threat step was "against", say), the sentence
 * says less rather than guessing.
 *
 * Plain data, no Phaser, so it is tested against real games.
