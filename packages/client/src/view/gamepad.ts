 * mean" as a pure, data-driven table rather than a scene `switch`, so the
 * mapping is testable without a canvas or an actual controller attached. The
 * scene's job (`scenes/board/input.ts#bindGamepad`) is only to translate a button
 * index the browser handed it into one of these intents and hand it to the
 * same `onIntent` the keyboard binding already calls — nothing about
 * focus order, targeting or dispatch lives here or there.
