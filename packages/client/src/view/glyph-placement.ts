/**
 * Where the key and button glyphs sit, as pure math (`docs/controller-support.md`, owner decisions 5 and 6).
 *
 * The rules, for all of it:
 *  - A glyph sits right beside its button's word, the pair centered together ("A CONFIRM"). It takes room only inside
 *    the button: the button never changes size, and the word slides over just far enough to make room (and slides back
 *    as the glyph closes). The word is never shortened or wrapped.
 *  - When glyph and word do not fit together, the glyph hangs just outside the button, below it or above it when below
 *    would leave the screen, like the MENU glyph.
 *  - A hanging glyph is never drawn over another object (a card, a pile, a panel): if its spot overlaps one, nothing
 *    is drawn at all.
 *  - Glyphs are for desktop and tablet landscape only, never the tabbed phone layouts.
 *
 * `ui/glyph-hints.ts` draws what these functions place.
