/**
 * Guided mode's hint warnings (G9a, docs/guided-mode.md §5.2, §3.13): five named heuristics that catch a costly
 * mistake before it happens — a scheme about to complete, lethal damage about to come in, a scheme one or two
 * threat from completing, flipping into a scheme that completes unopposed, and a payment that spends more (or a
 * better card) than it needs to.
 *
 * Each heuristic is a pure function over engine queries only — `characterProfile`, `mainSchemeValue`, `iconsInPlay`,
 * `legalActions`, `schemePanel` — never its own arithmetic over hidden state. In particular nothing here reads a
 * facedown boost card or the encounter deck's order (`view/visibility.ts`'s rule): `schemeFinishHint` stops at "the
 * villain's own SCH plus what's already on the table", and `lethalHint` stops at the villain's and engaged minions'
 * own ATK against the best possible block, exactly as §5.2 specifies, so a boost card that hasn't been flipped never
 * moves the number a hint shows.
 *
 * `hintsFor` is the one export a controller (G9b) calls: it picks which heuristics apply to the command about to
 * go out (`HintTrigger`), and drops anything the player has silenced or that the guide level says should stay
 * quiet (`GuidePrefs.level`, `docs/guided-mode.md` §3.6 — hints fire at "full" and "hints", never "off").
