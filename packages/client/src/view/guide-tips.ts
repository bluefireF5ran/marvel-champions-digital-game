/**
 * Guided mode's opportunistic tips (G10e part 1, `docs/guided-mode.md` §5.3): a short note the first time
 * something outside the five scripted lessons happens on the table, at the Full guide level only. Each tip is a
 * named, tested trigger over a `LessonObservation` (`view/lesson-model.ts` — the same `{ game, lastEvents,
 * perspectiveId }` shape the scripted lessons watch) and `GuidePrefs.seenTips`, so a controller can call this
 * alongside the lesson model with no extra state to thread through.
 *
 * **Two kinds, same as the parked prototype (`docs/guided-mode.md` §7, `cf134edf` `view/guide/game-tips.ts`):**
 *  - **Keyword and status tips come from the table's own glossary** (`rules-reference.ts`'s `rulesGlossaryOf`),
 *    generically — a new pack's keyword gets a tip for free, no copy added here. The three always-present
 *    table-state entries (exhausted, ready, facedown boost card) are excluded, same as the prototype: they would
 *    fire on the very first frame of every game, which teaches nothing.
 *  - **Situations** are read off live state and the most recent command's events: the first minion engaging, a
 *    side scheme or crisis icon in play, acceleration adding up, a boost card flipping, the villain advancing a
 *    stage, an obligation or nemesis card showing up, the first mulligan, the first Recover, hand size differing
 *    by form, and the first time an attack against you drew a card (a Spider-Sense-style interrupt, detected
 *    generically — see `drawOnAttackTip`).
 *
 * **No deps in the observation.** `LessonObservation` (deliberately) carries no `EngineDeps` — lesson predicates
 * never needed one. `tipsFor` takes its own `deps` parameter instead (G10e part 2), threaded straight through to
 * the queries that need one (`iconsInPlay`, `rulesGlossaryOf`) — the board's own mount
 * passes the session's real `EngineDeps` (`content/pool.ts`'s `POOL_DEPS`), so an ability-*granted* icon or
 * keyword counts here the same way it does everywhere else on the table, not just a printed one.
 *
 * **Never leaks hidden information** (`view/visibility.ts`'s rule, same as `view/guide-hints.ts`): nothing here
 * reads a facedown boost card's icons before it flips, or the encounter deck's order.
 *
 * **`tipsFor` is the one export a controller calls.** It returns at most one tip — the first not-yet-seen,
 * not-suppressed candidate, situations before the generic glossary catch-all, each family in the order this
 * module defines it — or an empty array when nothing new is showing, the level isn't "full", or there's no
 * perspective player yet.
