 * A hero's name as the player reads it.

 * heroes are shown with their alter ego: "Spider-Man (Peter Parker)", "Black Panther (Shuri)". The card's own name stays "Spider-Man" in content and
 * the engine, because uniqueness and "named" effects go by the printed title (RRG "Unique"); this is display only.
