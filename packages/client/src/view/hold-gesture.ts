/**
 * The card gesture every card-shaped control shares: a tap acts, a
 * press-and-hold or a right-click inspects, and — in a scrollable row — a
 * sideways drag scrolls.
 *
 * Framework-free so the rules can be tested without a canvas. `ui/hold-target.ts`
 * drives one instance per control from Phaser's pointer events and owns the
 * timer; this class only answers "what does that event mean?".
 *
 * **Why a slop radius rather than "any movement cancels".** A finger is not a
 * mouse. Over a 420 ms hold a fingertip rolls as it flattens and a phone
 * reports that as `touchmove`s a few pixels apart — more on a small, dense
 * screen held in one hand. The first version of this gesture cancelled the
 * hold for good on 8 px of sideways travel (it read as a scroll) and on any
 * `pointerout`, so on a phone a long press on a hand card near its edge, or
 * with an ordinarily unsteady thumb, never opened Inspect at all. iOS allows
 * 10 pt of travel in its own long-press recognizer and Android's touch slop is
 * 8 dp *per axis*; `HOLD_SLOP_PX` sits just above both, measured as a distance
 * from where the press began, and is checked when the timer fires rather than
 * on every event — a wobble that leaves the slop and comes back is still a hold.
