/**
 * Choosing which cards in play pay a cost that has a real choice in it (RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 13: a cost's choices are the
 * player's). "Exhaust your hero and any number of X-MEN allies →" (Mutant Peacekeepers, 34018), "Exhaust 1-3 SHIELD
 * cards" (Spider-Man's Morales kit), "Discard an upgrade you control →" with three upgrades out: each is an
 * `InPlayCostPick` (`min`, an optional `max`, a query), and `legalActions`' example command answers it with the
 * first `min` candidates, which is only a proof that some payment works. Before this, the board sent that example,
 * so the player never saw a question and never got to say "these two allies, not that one".
 *
 * Which cards could pay is the engine's own answer (`inPlayCostCandidates`), and so is the range (`InPlayCostPick`):
 * this module restates no rule. It tracks the picks, words the question and a live preview, and builds the
 * `costChoices` the engine's own payment then judges (`tryPayment`, `PaymentContext.costChoices`).
 *
 * One slot is asked at a time, in the cost's own order ("an [Avenger] character and a [Guardian] character" is two
 * slots); a card taken by an earlier slot is not offered to a later one, and a slot with only one possible answer is
 * not asked at all (the engine's own default stands, `forced` below).
