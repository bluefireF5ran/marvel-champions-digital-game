/**
 * The Inspect overlay's own layout (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 "W8"; D08,
 * P14, and T06 for how Inspect sits beside Targeting on tablet — owner
 * feedback 2026-09-18: "The inspect screen looks better in the screenshots
 * with more info showing" and "tablet could look like this too probably").
 *
 * **Two shapes, chosen by form factor alone — not by width threshold.**
 * D08's centered pair of equal-height panels (a paper card beside an ink
 * "Rules & state" panel) is the desktop **and tablet** shape, both
 * orientations; only a true phone (`formFactorFor` < 768px wide) gets P14's
 * bottom sheet. The previous build used `width < 900` as its own narrow
 * cutoff, which put tablet portrait (768×1024) through the phone's stacked
 * sheet — the very gap the owner's feedback names. `inspectLayout` fixes
 * that: `mode` is `"panels"` for every non-phone form factor, `"sheet"` only
 * for phone.
 *
 * **Panels mode.** Centered over the scrim, matching D08's own numbers: the
 * card panel caps at 400px wide, the rules panel at 440px, a 26px gap
 * between them, both the same height, with a bottom-centered hint row below
 * the pair. At narrower tablet widths the two panels shrink together
 * (47%/53% split) rather than overflowing; at very wide desktops they hold
 * their caps and center with more margin, exactly as D08's own `padding: 0
 * 70px` does at 1440px.
 *
 * **The pair is content-sized, not viewport-stretched** (owner feedback,
 * 2026-09-21: the ink "Rules & state" panel was reading as mostly empty with
 * a bare scrollbar track in it). The panel height is `max(card panel's own
 * content height, rules panel's own content height)`, clamped to the
 * viewport minus padding, then the pair is vertically centered — the same
 * shape D08 draws for its one worked example, where both panels happen to
 * come out equal. Neither pure function in here measures text: both take
 * pre-measured numbers (`cardFaceContentHeight`'s own `CardFaceContent`,
 * mirroring `cardFaceLayout`'s), the same "the scene measures, this file only
 * lays out" contract `cardFaceLayout` already kept for `rulesTextLines`. The
 * rules panel's own content height has no pure counterpart here — its
 * sections (right now / timing / keywords / traits / history) are the
 * scene's own bespoke draw, not `inspect-layout.ts`'s concern — so
 * `scenes/inspect.ts#rebuild` calls `inspectLayout` twice: once to learn each
 * panel's *width* (content-independent), then again, after measuring both
 * panels' natural content height at that width, to get the final centered
 * rect pair.
 *
 * **Sheet mode.** P14's bottom sheet: a grab handle, one `McScrollRegion`
 * (`ui/scroll-region.ts`) holding the whole scrolling body — thumbnail, name,
 * type line, keyword chips, rules text, a bordered parchment "keywords" box,
 * "this game" history rows — and a sticky ink footer of two rows (the
 * primary Play/Pay row, then the quiet Full rules text/Close row). `expanded`
 * (the "Full rules text" toggle) grows the sheet to the full viewport height,
 * per the design's own instruction that it "expands the sheet to full height
 * with the complete scrolling text". Only the *outer* geometry here is
 * pre-measured: unlike the panels' card face, the sheet's `content` rect
 * never depends on its own content's height (there is no sibling panel to
 * share a height with), so `scenes/inspect.ts#drawSheetContent` measures with
 * real Phaser text objects as it draws, top to bottom, in one pass — the same
 * thing `#drawCardTextBlock` already does for the panels' card face text.
 * `sheetTextColumn` and `sheetPlayPayWidths` below are the two bits of that
 * scene's own arithmetic that don't need live text measurement and so belong
 * here instead, tested without a canvas.
 *
 * `cardFaceLayout` is the second half: the paper card panel's own internal
 * split between its art and its scrolling rules text, ported from what used
 * to be computed with a throwaway offscreen Phaser `Text` object
 * (`scenes/inspect.ts`'s old `#drawCard`) into a pure function over an
 * `estimateWrappedLines` line count, so the "long rules text" case is
 * testable without a canvas.
