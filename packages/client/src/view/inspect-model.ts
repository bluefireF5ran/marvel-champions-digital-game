 * keywords and the three status cards, not ability-timing headers — there is no RRG glossary term titled "Hero
 * Action" or "Interrupt" for it to cite. Only two trigger kinds resolve to a real entry today: `setup` (the
 * glossary's own "Setup" term) and `boost` (`view/rules-reference.ts`'s client-side "Facedown boost card" entry,
 * which is the RRG's actual "Boost, Boost Icon" glossary term, p. 11 — `@mc/content` can't own it itself, since
 * it's runtime instance state, not schema data; see that module's header). Every other kind (`action`, `resource`,
 * `interrupt`, `response`, `whenRevealed`, `whenDefeated`, `whenCompleted`, `special`, `stateCheck`, `constant`)
 * returns nothing here — not a made-up paraphrase — per this task's own instruction not to write rules prose for a
 * kind the glossary doesn't cover. A future content pass that adds those RRG terms to the glossary would only need
 * to widen `TRIGGER_GLOSSARY_ID` below; nothing here would need to change shape.
