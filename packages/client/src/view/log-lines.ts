/**
 * The game log, built from the engine's `GameEvent` stream.
 *
 * The design canvas (Components.dc.html section 05) shows the log as numbered
 * beats with status tags inline, and struck through when a status is spent:
 *
 *     R3.2  You played Stun → STUNNED attached to Klaw.
 *     R3.5  Klaw's attack cancelled — STUNNED discarded.
 *     R3.5  She-Hulk took 0 damage — TOUGH spent.
 *
 * Most `GameEvent`s are bookkeeping the player should never read (stack frames,
 * timing windows, trigger announcements). `logLine` returns null for those, so
 * the log stays a readable account of the table rather than an engine trace.
 * The full trace is still in the session log for replay.
