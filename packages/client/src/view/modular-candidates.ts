/**
 * Which modular encounter sets Table setup offers for a scenario (owner decision 2026-10-04). RRG 1.8 "Modular
 * Encounter Set" (p. 28): modular sets "can be added to and/or removed from nearly any scenario"; the FAQ calls a set
 * modular when it is neither scenario-specific nor campaign-specific. So the picker offers every modular set of every
 * unlocked pack, the scenario's own recommendation first.
 *
 * A set is a candidate when `@mc/cards`' `isModularChoice` accepts it (not the scenario's own set or difficulty set, not
 * Standard/Expert, nemesis, obligation-campaign, campaign, competitive or extra) and it is not scenario-specific:
 *
 * - a set a scenario names among its own `encounterSetIds` and no scenario recommends as a modular set (Rhino, Klaw,
 *   Hela's own sets). Sets such as Sentinels or Brotherhood are both a scenario's own and another's modular pick, so
 *   they stay modular;
 * - a set holding a villain or main scheme card (the Wrecking Crew's four villain sets).
 *
 * Unlocking follows the app's one source (`progression/unlocks.ts`): a set is offered once the wave (`Cycle.id`) of any
 * pack it shipped in is open. The scenario's own recommended sets are always offered, since the table is playing it.
 *
 * Scenarios that restrict the pool keep it: a restricted `modularSetPool` (Spiral, Mojo) offers only its own sets, and a
 * scenario that calls for no modular sets (Breakout, The Hood) keeps the short list it always had, because there is
 * nothing to add a set to.
