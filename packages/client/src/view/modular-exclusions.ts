 * Scenario x modular set pairings Table setup must not offer (owner decision 2026-10-04: every modular set from an
 * unlocked pack is a candidate, so a pairing that cannot work has to be named here, and is shown disabled with its
 * short reason rather than hidden). Only rule-based exclusions are left after the matrix fixes
 * (docs/phase7-wave6-qa-modular-matrix.md section 6); `modular-candidates.test.ts` holds every entry to a real scenario,
 * a real set and a reason short enough for a tile. What a scenario already has (its own sets, Experimental Weapons at
 * Crossbones) or takes none of (Breakout, The Hood, The Sinister Six) never reaches this table: the candidate list
 * leaves those out.
