/**
 * Same-name conflicts at the seat screens (owner, 2026-10-03): a card in a seated deck that cannot enter play because
 * it matches another seat's hero, found before the game starts so the player can swap it or knowingly keep it as a
 * resource (a card that can't be played can still be spent to pay).
 *
 * The match is never decided here: it is the engine's own `cardsMatch`, with the table rule when the game will run
 * with it (`TableRules.sameNameHeroAllyConflict`). That covers both the option's pairs (the Valkyrie ally against the
 * Valkyrie hero, the Ironheart ally against Ironheart) and the pairs that clash under FFG's rule alone (the ally
 * subtitled "Kitty Pryde" against the Shadowcat hero, the Colossus ally subtitled "Piotr Rasputin" against the Colossus
 * hero, a T'Challa-subtitled Black Panther ally against Black Panther (T'Challa)). A deck's clash with its
 * OWN identity is a deckbuilding matter (`validateDeck` reports it) and is not listed here.
 *
 * A swap (`DeckSwap`) replaces every copy of one card with the same number of copies of another. It is applied to the
 * deck as the game is built (`applyDeckSwaps`); the saved deck is never touched.
