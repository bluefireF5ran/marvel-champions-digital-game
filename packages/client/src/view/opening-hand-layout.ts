/**
 * The setup screen's opening-hand row (`scenes/setup-deal.ts#drawOpeningHand`): a single centered row when every
 * card reads at this width, otherwise a horizontally scrolling strip of full-size cards.
 *
 * Reported from a Pixel 9 Pro XL (2026-09-19): the previous fallback — the P13 two-row grid — split a six-card
 * hand into two rows of ~80px-wide thumbnails inside a ~360px column, "nearly impossible to see". Two rows halve
 * the height each card gets, and a card's height is what makes its text legible. A strip keeps every card at the
 * row's full height (the same trade `Board - Phone`'s hand makes, `view/layout.ts#cardRow`'s `fan: "expanded"`)
 * and lets the player swipe sideways; two cards and the edge of a third are visible at a time, which is also the
 * strip's own affordance that there is more to the right. `HandScroll` (`view/hand-scroll.ts`) owns the offset.
 *
 * Nothing here imports Phaser: the scene draws what this returns and subtracts the scroll offset itself.
