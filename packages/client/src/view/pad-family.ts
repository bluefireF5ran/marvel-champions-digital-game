/**
 * Which controller is attached, and what its buttons are called.
 *
 * The Web Gamepad API's "standard" layout reports buttons by position (index 0 is the bottom face button on every
 * pad), so the intent table in `view/gamepad.ts` is positional. What differs between pads is only the label printed
 * on each position, and that is all this module answers: a family from `Gamepad.id`, and the glyph for an index in
 * that family. Pure data, so it is testable with the id strings real browsers report.
 *
 * Owner decisions (2026-10-24, `docs/controller-support.md`):
 *  - Under Steam (the Steam Deck, or any game launched through Steam Input) the pad is Steam's virtual Xbox pad, and
 *    Steam's own "Use Nintendo layout" option already swaps buttons for us, so we take what it sends as it is.
 *  - Everywhere else the player gets our own "Use Nintendo Switch layout" setting: on a Nintendo-family pad, buttons
 *    act by their printed label (A, on the right, confirms; B, at the bottom, backs out), as on a Switch.
