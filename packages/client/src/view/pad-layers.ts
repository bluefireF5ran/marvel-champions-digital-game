/**
 * The LT and RT hold layers (`docs/controller-support.md` decision 9): hold a trigger and the face buttons and
 * bumpers change meaning.
 *
 *  - Hold LT: A Attack, X Thwart, Y Recover, B Change form, LB Undo, RB End turn.
 *  - Hold RT: A / X / Y / B are the first four abilities usable right now on your cards in play, in table order;
 *    LB / RB page when there are more.
 *
 * Positions are the standard layout's (Xbox letters: 0 bottom, 1 right, 2 left, 3 top); PlayStation and Switch use the
 * same positions. A press arrives as a standard-layout index after the Nintendo swap (`view/pad-family.ts#physicalIndexOf`),
 * so `layerActionOf` takes that meaning index and `layerSheet` draws the glyph of the button that carries it.
 *
 * Pure data: the Board decides what is available and calls `layerSheet` to draw the sheet by the action bar.
