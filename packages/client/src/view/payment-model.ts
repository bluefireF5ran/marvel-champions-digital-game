/**
 * Paying for a card, as the player's own decision.
 *
 * Until now the client played a card with whatever payment the engine happened
 * to find first (`LegalAction.example`). That is a legal payment, but it is not
 * the player's — spending the wrong card is how you lose a turn two rounds
 * later, and choosing what to spend is a real part of the game.
 *
 * The design makes this a *mode over the hand*, not a dialog (`Board - Phone`:
 * a red bar reading "PAYING 1 / 3 — Photon Blast → Klaw. Tap cards to spend."
 * above a hand whose cards you tap). So this module is the state of that mode,
 * and the Board draws it.
 *
 * Every judgement belongs to the engine: `paymentFor` says what may be spent
 * and what it is worth, and `tryPayment` is the only thing that decides whether
 * a selection is enough. This model counts pips for the bar and nothing else.
