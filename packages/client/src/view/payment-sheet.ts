 * The payment sheet's two answers, kept apart (a `payForCard` / `payForAbility` choice raised inside a timing window).

 * pressed with too few cards picked used to answer the question with a silent no. This model separates them: Confirm
 * is live only when the engine would actually take the payment, and says what is still missing; declining is its own
 * control with its own name. Whether a selection pays is judged by the engine (a dry run of the same `resolveChoice`
 * command, the way `discard-choice-model.ts` probes), never recounted here; the count in the label is only a
 * best-effort tally for the words.
