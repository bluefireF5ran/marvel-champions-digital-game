/**
 * The platform mark on a saved game (device sync, #276): a small monochrome icon and its text label, so a Continue row
 * (and any list that mixes games from several linked devices) says where each game was last played.
 *
 * Pure data: the label and the icon as a list of strokes and fills on a 24 x 24 grid. The scene draws them with
 * Graphics (`ui/play-platform-icon.ts`), the way `ui/music-icon.ts` draws its mark, so they sit the same on every
 * device font and need no image. No trademarked logos: generic glyphs (globe, window panes, laptop, terminal, phone).
 * A save without a `lastPlayedOn` (older saves) has no mark.
