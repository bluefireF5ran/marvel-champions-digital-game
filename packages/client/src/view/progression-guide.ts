/**
 * "How it works" in Settings ▸ Unlocks: the player-facing explanation of progression and champion points.
 *
 * These are this app's own features, not Marvel Champions rules, and the guide opens by saying so: nothing here
 * changes how a game plays, and the rules engine never sees any of it. Built from the same `POINTS` and
 * `UNLOCK_WAVES` the progression itself runs on, so the numbers on screen can't drift from the code. The repo copy,
 * docs/progression.md, is checked against the same values by `progression-guide.test.ts`.
