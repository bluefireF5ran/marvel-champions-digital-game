/**
 * Replacements for a card that cannot be played at this table (`name-conflicts.ts`): the cards the deck could hold
 * instead, best first. Pure; the screens only draw it.
 *
 * Legality is never decided here. The pool is what the deck builder offers for this identity and aspects
 * (`browsablePool`), narrowed to the cards that keep the deck legal under the engine's `validateDeck` (aspect, deck
 * limits, unique rules, with every copy of the old card replaced), that do not themselves match a seated hero
 * (`cardsMatch` with the table rule), and that the player's packs include (`isUnlocked`).
 *
 * Ranking: allies of the same aspect as the old card first (basic for a basic card), then the other legal allies,
 * then every other legal card; within a tier the nearest cost first, then by name. The first row is the recommended
 * default.
 *
 * A hero's own identity-specific card (`aspect` "hero:...") can only be replaced by a Team-Up card (RRG 1.8 p. 50,
 * Appendix I). That is still the engine's call: a card is offered only when it carries the Team-Up keyword, the swapped
 * deck validates with the other seated identities, and the same deck does NOT validate without them (so the engine
 * accepted the missing card because of the Team-Up rule). Nothing here compares the names a Team-Up card carries.
