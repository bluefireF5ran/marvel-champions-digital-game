/**
 * S4 (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §2): win/loss records derived from
 * `GameStorage.list()` — per scenario (and per difficulty within it) for W2's
 * Scenario select record line, and per deck for W9's Decks & Collection
 * per-deck record. Pure: takes the list `GameStorage.list()` already returned
 * rather than touching storage itself, so it's plain TypeScript with Vitest
 * tests, no engine/`@mc/cards`/`@mc/content` change.
 *
 * **Which statuses count, and why** (`SaveStatus`, `engine/game-storage.ts`):
 * - `won` / `lost` are results: they count as a win or a loss, and as a
 *   played game.
 * - `abandoned` (a game the player removed from the in-progress list, a campaign
 *   run started over, and later also Concede, per docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §4)
 *   is **not** a win or a loss —
 *   the scenario was never resolved — but it *is* a played game and a real
 *   "last played" moment: the player sat down and made moves, so hiding it
 *   from "games played" would quietly under-report how much a scenario or
 *   deck was actually played.
 * - `incompatible` counts as **none of the above** — not a win, loss, played
 *   game, or last-played candidate. `session-core.ts`'s `resume` only ever
 *   marks a still-`active` save `incompatible` (a finished `won`/`lost` game
 *   is never resumed, so its result is never overwritten); an `incompatible`
 *   save is therefore always a game that was in progress and never reached a
 *   result under this build. Its `round`/`outcome` describe a log that no
 *   longer replays, not a trustworthy achievement — kept only so the log can
 *   still be exported (`game-storage.ts`'s own doc comment), not as a record
 *   row.
 * - `active` (a game still in progress; several can be, device sync #276) is
 *   a played game too, since one left behind is no longer retired by the next
 *   game started. It has no result yet, so it is no win or loss and its round
 *   never counts toward the best clear. Once it ends, its own `SaveMeta` row
 *   flips to `won`/`lost`/`abandoned` — there is no double count, since each
 *   game is one `SaveMeta` row updated in place, never accumulated.
 *
 * So "played" here always means `status === "won" || "lost" || "abandoned" || "active"`.
 *
 * **Best clear.** `SaveMeta.round` is the round the game's log stands at —
 * for a `won` save, the round the villain was defeated on. "Fewest rounds
 * among wins" is computed only over `won` saves; a `lost`/`abandoned` save's
 * `round` never counts toward it, whatever number it happens to hold.
 * Difficulty (`SessionConfig.difficulty`: `"standard" | "expert" |
 * "extreme"`, which also carries Breakout's own multi-villain "extreme" —
 * `host.ts`'s own doc comment) is a real difference in achievement, so every
 * count is kept both per difficulty (`byDifficulty`) and summed (`combined`)
 * — a screen can show either without this module guessing which one it
 * wants.
 *
 * **Deck attribution.** A deck key is namespaced by *how* the seat is
 * attributable, so a precon id and a custom deck-storage id can never
 * collide even if their raw strings coincided: `{ kind: "starter",
 * starterDeckId }` for a `{ starterDeckId }` seat, `{ kind: "custom", deckId
 * }` for a custom seat that carries `deckId` (`CorePlayer`,
 * `packages/cards/src/core/setup.ts`; landed 2026-09-17, see
 * docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §2 S4). A custom seat with no `deckId` at
 * all — every seat in a save written before that field existed — is
 * **unattributed**: it contributes to no deck's record, by construction
 * (there is no key to file it under), but the game it's in still counts
 * fully in its scenario's record above. `unattributedGameCount` and
 * `unattributedSeatCount` (over "played" games only, the same scope as
 * everything else here) exist so a screen can say "3 games not shown here —
 * played before deck tracking" instead of silently under-reporting a deck's
 * count. A `deckId` that no longer resolves to a stored deck (the deck was
 * since deleted, or this list is being read against different deck storage
 * than it was written from) is the caller's problem, not this module's: it
 * still keys a `DeckRecord` by that id, resolving the id against live deck
 * storage — or saying it no longer resolves — is for whatever reads
 * `decks` here.
 *
 * **A game with N seats credits each *distinct* deck once, not once per
 * seat.** Two seats playing the same deck (if that's even legal) still only
 * add one win/loss/played to that deck's record for that game — the game
 * happened once.
