/**
 * The plain-TS filter model behind every searchable, scrollable roster
 * (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §2 "S8"): Title's scenario picker and hero
 * seat picker today, the Decks screen's deck list and W9's deck list later.
 *
 * Matching is case- and accent-insensitive, and true on an empty query (a
 * blank search field shows everything). Every filter function here takes the
 * query as its last argument and a list of "haystacks" — the fields S8 lists
 * per roster kind — so a caller only has to say *what* a row's searchable
 * text is; this module is the one place that decides *how* two strings match.
 *
 * **Quick filters** (S8): `RosterFilter` carries one optional field per chip,
 * each `&&`ed onto the text match rather than replacing it — a chip narrows
 * what the search already found, it doesn't compete with it.
 * - **Heroes:** `aspect` (the deck's own chosen aspect(s), `Deck.aspects` —
 *   not a per-card aspect), `source` (`Deck.source.kind`), and `playableOnly`
 *   ("playable now": hide a seat the engine currently blocks). `playableOnly`
 *   needs to know *why* a deck is blocked, which isn't a fact about the deck
 *   itself — `view/seats.ts` already computes it per seating — so
 *   `heroRosterMatches` takes it as a separate `blockedBy` argument rather
 *   than reading it off `Deck`. This is a *display* filter: a row hidden by
 *   `playableOnly` is still exactly as blocked or seatable as it was: nothing
 *   here changes `DeckOption`/`SeatOption`, it only decides what's drawn.
 * - **Scenarios:** `product` (`Scenario.packCode`). `@mc/content` has no
 *   `Cycle`/`Pack` data wired into the app pool yet (`pool.ts`), so "or
 *   cycle" isn't buildable today; `scenarioProductsOf` derives the chip list
 *   from whatever pack codes are actually present, which grows on its own as
 *   packs are added.
