/**
 * The pack-shelf roster (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 W2b, the owner's decision
 * 2026-09-18 superseding this workstream's own earlier flat-grid brief):
 * Scenario select and Take your seats both group their roster into one
 * horizontally-scrolling shelf per pack, in release order, with search
 * matching the items *nested inside* every shelf rather than the shelf
 * itself.
 *
 * Deliberately generic over the item type `T` (a `Scenario` or a `DeckOption`)
 * so this one pure function, and its one set of tests, covers both rosters —
 * the same reasoning `view/roster-filter.ts`'s own doc comment gives for
 * having one `heroRosterMatches`/`scenarioRosterMatches` pair instead of two
 * near-duplicate copies. The caller does the per-kind work this module can't
 * (which fields to search, which pack an item belongs to, whether the quick-
 * filter chips already exclude it) and hands in one `ShelfCandidate` per item;
 * this module only decides the shelf *structure*: which shelf an item lands
 * in, whether a query keeps it there, and which shelves survive at all.
