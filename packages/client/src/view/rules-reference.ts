/**
 * Rules Reference (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 "W4"): the glossary, filtered by
 * scope and search, the villain phase order, and the scenario's card list.
 *
 * **Two scopes.** "On your table" (the default with a live game) means every card
 * instance sitting somewhere a player can see its live keywords right now: every
 * identity, every player's play area, the villain area (villain(s), minions, side
 * schemes, environments) and the main scheme, plus whatever is attached to or
 * boosted onto any of those. A card asleep in a deck or discard pile doesn't widen
 * it just because it's in the pool — RRG p. 12 "Choose (Game Element)" and the
 * client's own `view/visibility.ts` already draw that line for hidden information;
 * this reuses the same idea for "what's relevant right now" rather than a
 * rules-visibility rule. "All rules" (`rulesGlossaryPoolOf`; the only scope with no
 * game) is every entry regardless of the table, with cards drawn from the whole
 * pool instead — owner feedback (2026-09-18) asked the Rules overlay to show "card
 * art if applicable" even for a keyword nothing on the table happens to carry.
 *

 * **The three entries `@mc/content`'s glossary leaves out** — "exhausted",
 * "ready", "facedown boost card" — are added here, from the client side, exactly
 * as `schema/glossary.ts`'s own file header calls for: they're genuine RRG 1.8
 * glossary terms (pp. 19, 36, 11 respectively — see `TABLE_STATE_ENTRIES`'s own
 * comment on why the third page differs from the number docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md
 * guessed), but they're runtime instance state (`CardInstance.exhausted`,
 * `CardInstance.boostCards`) that only `@mc/engine` models, not a `@mc/content`
 * schema enum — so `@mc/content` can't own them without depending on the engine,
 * which the dependency direction forbids. These three are always shown (they're
 * true of essentially every game state, not conditional on what's in play), and
 * search filters them exactly like every other entry.
 *
 * **Basic concepts** (guided mode G3a) are `@mc/content`'s `kind: "concept"` glossary
 * entries — threat, main scheme, thwart, and the rest of a first-time player's starting
 * vocabulary. They're never printed on a card and never table/instance state, so unlike a
 * keyword or status they don't belong to "what's on your table right now" the way
 * `tableAssociationsOf` means it — Pause's own "on the table" cards and count
 * (`rulesGlossaryOf`'s default) leave them out. The Rules reference screen's own glossary
 * *tab*, though, wants them alongside everything else a first-time player might search for
 * regardless of scope — it opts in via `rulesGlossaryOf`'s `includeConcepts` option
 * (`CONCEPT_ENTRIES` below) — and `rulesGlossaryPoolOf`'s "all rules" scope always includes
 * them too, the same way the three table-state entries are always included there.
