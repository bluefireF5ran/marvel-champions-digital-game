/**
 * Scenario select (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 W2/W2b, D02/P02), composition
 * read off `docs/design-renders/ScreensDesktop_01-02.png` and
 * `ScreensPhone_00.png`, rebuilt 2026-09-18 and revised the same day for the
 * owner's second-pass notes (real gutters instead of ~120px dead margins at
 * desktop widths, a fixed ~300px full-height side panel inset 24px like the
 * tile, no capped-at-1200 column):
 *
 * A full-width **ink** header bar runs across the top at every size — Back
 * (Bangers, `typeRole.backLabel`) and the Bangers page title
 * (`typeRole.pageTitle`) beside it on the left, the step meta as an uppercase
 * label on the right. Below it the ground is **paper**.
 *
 * **Wide (desktop/tabletLandscape): two columns**, matching D02, with a real
 * `GUTTER` (24px) on every edge — no artificial column cap producing dead
 * margins at wide viewports. On the left: the search field, the compact
 * product-chip strip, the pack-shelf roster (tall art cards, no boxed
 * background of its own — `ui/shelf-roster.ts`'s `background: false`, item 3
 * of the second pass), and a bordered stat strip underneath it, the same
 * width. On the right: a **full-height ink** "stages" panel, `DETAIL_WIDTH`
 * (300px) wide, inset `GUTTER` from the body's own top/right/bottom, with the
 * one red action pinned at its own foot and a small footer label under it.
 *
 * **Narrow (phone/tabletPortrait): one column**, stacked: one chip row — a
 * square search toggle at its head, then the product chips as a sideways-
 * scrolling rail (`chipsScroll`, `ui/chip-rail.ts`) — the search field only
 * while the toggle is on (`searchOpen`; the owner's 2026-09-21 phone note: "I
 * would rather have the vertical space back on mobile — add a search toggle"),
 * the shelf roster (scrolls; no "how many rows fit" arithmetic), the stat
 * strip, the ink detail block (sized to its own line count), then the
 * full-width CTA at the screen's own foot.
