/**
 * Where the schemes column puts its rows: a pure function of the panel's rect and how many schemes are in play
 * (`scenes/board/schemes.ts` draws it; nothing here imports Phaser).
 *
 * The column has to hold the main scheme (two in Tower Defense) and every side scheme in play, and the table gives
 * it a fixed share of the villain band. On a short tablet the share is less than three rows tall (owner report,
 * 2026-10-04: Project Wideawake on a tablet in landscape drew its third scheme under the hero's panel), so the
 * order of preference is:
 *
 * 1. Every row at its normal size, growing into a tall zone (an ultrawide) as far as every scheme still fits.
 * 2. Every row, with the main scheme at a compact height (`MAIN_COMPACT_HEIGHT`), when only that makes them fit.
 * 3. Otherwise the side schemes scroll in a viewport inside the panel, under the main scheme(s), which stay pinned
 *    at the top. A panel too short to show one side scheme and a peek of the next scrolls everything together.
 *
 * A row is never drawn outside the panel: a scrolling row is clipped to `viewport`.
