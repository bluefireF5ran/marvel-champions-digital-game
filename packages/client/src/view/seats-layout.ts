/**
 * Take your seats (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 W2/W2b, D03/P03/T-P02),
 * composition read off `docs/design-renders/ScreensDesktop_02-03.png`,
 * `ScreensTablet_01-02.png` and `ScreensPhone_00.png`, rebuilt 2026-09-18 and
 * revised the same day for the owner's second-pass notes (real gutters, a
 * fixed ~300px full-height side panel, taller seat cards, "Use
 * preconstructed" folded into the roster's own header row instead of its own
 * full-width strip):
 *
 * The same full-width **ink** header bar as Scenario select — Back (Bangers,
 * labeled with the chosen scenario's own name) and the Bangers page title on
 * the left, the step count on the right.
 *
 * **Wide (desktop/tabletLandscape): two columns.** On the left: four
 * equal-width, individually-selectable seat cards in one row (115px tall —
 * a portrait thumbnail, the seat label, the hero name, a meta line), a
 * `rosterHeader` row (the "HEROES — SEAT N OF 4" label on the left, the small
 * quiet "Use preconstructed for all seats" button right-aligned on the same
 * line), then the search field, the aspect/source chip strip, and the
 * pack-shelf hero roster (no boxed background of its own). On the right: a
 * **full-height ink** hero-detail panel, `DETAIL_WIDTH` wide, inset `GUTTER`,
 * with two actions pinned at its own foot.
 *
 * **Narrow (phone/tabletPortrait): P03's own composition** (rebuilt 2026-09-19
 * after the owner's phone screenshot: the 2×2 seat cards, three wrapped chip
 * rows, a hero-detail block *and* the two actions all had to fit one 844px
 * screen, which left the shelf roster a ~160px strip that cropped every card
 * to its top third — "mobile is completely broken"). One column, top to
 * bottom: one row of four compact **seat chips** (P03's "SEAT 1 / C. MARVEL"
 * strip, not the wide layout's 115px cards); the `rosterHeader` row, now a
 * full 44px touch row holding the active seat's **details disclosure**
 * (`detailsToggle`, one line: aspect · HP · hand, or "Tap a hero for seat N")
 * on the left and "Use preconstructed" on the right; only while that
 * disclosure is open (`detailsOpen`), the **seat summary** block (the stat
 * lines and obligation/nemesis, with the "Clear seat" control — this is where
 * the wide layout's ink detail panel and the seat card's "✕" both went); one
 * chip row — a square **search toggle** (`searchToggle`) at its head, then
 * the chips as **one horizontally-scrolling rail** (`chipsScroll`, drawn by
 * `ui/chip-rail.ts`) rather than wrapped rows; the search field only while
 * that toggle is on (`searchOpen`); then the shelves take **every remaining
 * pixel** above a sticky ink `footer` carrying Deck check and Play — the same
 * sticky-footer shape Table setup's own phone layout (P12) already uses.
 * `detail` is null on narrow: nothing else is allowed to take height away
 * from the roster. (Revised 2026-09-21 for the owner's phone note: the always-
 * open summary, header row and search field together cost the roster ~150px
 * of an 844px screen; "this stuff should be collapsible".)
