/**
 * S2 (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §2): the setup choices that today live as
 * private fields on `TitleScene` — scenario, difficulty, modular sets, seats
 * (a deck per seat), first player, seed, and the two roster search queries —
 * collected into one plain, serializable object with a pure update API.
 * `scenes/title.ts` is the only screen that reads and writes it today; W2
 * splits Scenario select / Take your seats / Table setup into their own
 * screens later, and they'll share this same object.
 *
 * **No per-villain version field** (removed 2026-09-17, PLAN.md's "Wrecker
 * can't be played from Title"): Breakout's difficulty buttons alone decide
 * every villain's version now (standard = A, expert = B, extreme = A with B
 * underneath), so there is no separate choice for a draft to hold. The row
 * that let a player override one villain confused "which villain" with
 * "which crew are we playing", pushed Start game off-screen, and had
 * unclickable chips at some sizes. `SessionConfig.villainVersions` stays on
 * the engine side for a future "advanced" option; `toSessionConfig` below
 * simply never sends it. The Four Horsemen's A/B sides are a different field (`horsemanSides`): wave 8's builder takes
 * its own four-sided tuple, not `villainVersions`, and strips the latter.
 *
 * **What's deliberately *not* in `SetupDraft`:**
 * - **The seed field's raw text.** `draft.seed` is the last value that parsed
 *   as a legal seed; the text a player is mid-typing (which can be empty, or
 *   momentarily not a number) is transient input-validation state, not a
 *   setup *choice* — `view/seed.ts`'s own doc comment draws this same line.
 *   The scene keeps that buffer itself, same as today.
 * - **Which decks/scenarios exist, and whether a seat is blocked.** Those
 *   come from `@mc/content`/`view/deck-list-model.ts`/`view/seats.ts`, not
 *   from a setup choice — this module takes them as read-only inputs
 *   (`Scenario | undefined`, `DeckOption[]`) wherever a choice needs to be
 *   validated against them, and never caches its own copy.
 *
 * `toSessionConfig` is the one place that turns a draft into the existing
 * `SessionConfig` shape (`engine/host.ts`) — the same shape `TitleScene`
 * builds by hand today, byte for byte (`setup-draft.test.ts`'s round-trip
 * test), because `SessionConfig` is also the save shape and Phase 5's future
 * network shape.

 * kept for honesty rather than assumed away, so a caller can still draw "Pick a hero first" instead of a crash.
