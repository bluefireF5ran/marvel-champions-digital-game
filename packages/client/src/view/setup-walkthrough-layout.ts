/**
 * Setup deal & mulligan (W3, docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3), composition read
 * off `docs/design-renders/ScreensDesktop_05-06.png` (D06), `ScreensPhone_02.png`
 * (P13) and `ScreensTablet_02-03.png` (L05), corrected by the 2026-09-18
 * fidelity pass against the same tiles (the first pass matched the structure
 * but not the look — see `scenes/setup-deal.ts`'s header for what changed):
 *
 * An ink void ground throughout, and a full-width ink header bar: "SETTING UP
 * THE TABLE" (Bangers, padded well clear of the viewport's top edge — the
 * glyphs' own ascenders clip if the bar has no headroom above the text) with
 * "Step N of M · <what's happening>" inline immediately to its right, not a
 * small badge pinned to the far corner. Below it, a row of checklist chips:
 * uppercase, letter-spaced, a green-outlined dark wash for a done step, solid
 * Hero Red for the one in progress, a dim outline for what's still ahead.
 *
 * **Two different compositions, not one narrowed to fit.** Phone,
 * tablet-portrait and desktop share one — "focus" — built the same way
 * `table-setup-layout.ts` splits Table setup: a body column (the currently
 * deciding seat's own hand as full cards — one row where they read, a
 * sideways-scrolling strip of full-height cards where they wouldn't,
 * `view/opening-hand-layout.ts` — a compact "Mulligan N"/"Keep all N"
 * pair under it, then "Other seats" — a side-by-side row of compact seat
 * cards on tablet-portrait/desktop, since a 4-player game only ever has up to
 * three, stacked full-width only on phone where there isn't the width for a
 * row) beside a persistent sidebar ("Setup card revealed" over "Setup log")
 * on tablet-portrait and desktop, the sidebar folded below the body on phone.
 * On phone the commit row is pinned to the bottom of the viewport, like the
 * Board's own action bar, rather than sitting inline after the hand — the
 * one place on this screen a player must always find without scrolling.
 * **Tablet landscape (L05) is its own composition**: one column per seat so
 * every seat's hand is visible at once, with a footer row for the note and
 * the commit buttons — not a wider "focus" body, which would waste a long
 * table's own width on a single seat when there's room to show every seat
 * mulliganing at once.
