/**
 * Setup deal & mulligan (W3, docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 — D06, P13, L05).
 *
 * The dedicated screen shown once, before round 1, in place of the generic
 * pending-choice sheet: villain and main scheme placed, starting threat,
 * setup cards revealed, obligations shuffled in, opening hands, mulligan.
 * Every fact here is read off live `GameState` — the checklist, the current
 * decider, each seat's hand — except two things the engine's *state* only
 * ever shows the *result* of, never the path there: which encounter card was
 * revealed most recently, and how many cards a seat that has already
 * resolved its mulligan actually discarded. Those two live in
 * `SetupWalkthroughLog`, a small accumulator over the same `GameEvent`
 * stream `view/log-lines.ts` already turns into the log — folded forward one
 * command's `events` at a time by the scene, the same way `LogState` is.
 *
 * **Composition** (docs/design-reference.md's `ScreensDesktop_05–06`,
 * `ScreensPhone_02` P13, `ScreensTablet_02–03` L05): an ink void ground
 * throughout. A header bar names the screen and "Step N of M"; below it a
 * row of checklist chips — green check for done, red fill for the step in
 * progress, gray outline for what's still ahead. Desktop and tablet-portrait
 * split the body: a paper-toned "YOUR OPENING HAND — <hero>" panel (full
 * cards, each with its own mulligan toggle, "Mulligan N"/"Keep all N" below
 * it) beside "OTHER SEATS" (kept/still-deciding status cards) on the left,
 * and a persistent sidebar on the right carrying "SETUP CARD REVEALED" (the
 * most recently revealed encounter card, full rules text) over "SETUP LOG"
 * (`view/log-lines.ts`'s own numbered-beat wording). Phone stacks the same
 * five groups in one column, sidebar folded under the body. **Tablet
 * landscape (L05) is a different composition, not a narrower version of the
 * same one**: one column per seat, every seat's hand visible at once — the
 * deciding seat's own column carries the toggles and the commit row: "all
 * four seats mulligan on one screen" is the point of that layout, so this
 * module's `seats[].hand` is what it reads for every seat, not only the one
 * deciding.
 *
 * "Why this matters" (P13) is out of scope — §4 hasn't settled advice text.
