/**
 * Table setup (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 W2, D05/P12), composition read
 * off the owner's own D05 screenshot (2026-09-18 correction, which supersedes
 * the brief this module was first written against — see that correction's
 * full text for the exact wording, reproduced here as the composition this
 * layout implements):
 *
 * A full-width **ink** header bar: "◂ Seats" (Bangers), the Bangers page
 * title "Set the table", "STEP 4 OF 4" on the right — the same shape
 * Scenario select/Take your seats use.
 *
 * **Wide (desktop/tabletLandscape):** the ground below the header is
 * **paper**, split into a body column and a fixed ~300px full-height **ink**
 * sidebar inset 24px from the body's own top/right/bottom (`scenario-select-
 * layout.ts`'s own pattern, reused so the setup flow reads as one product).
 * The body stacks four sections, each a Bangers header + a full-bleed ink
 * rule (`ui/widgets.ts`'s `sectionHeader`), some carrying a right-aligned
 * label:
 *  - **DIFFICULTY** — up to three equal-width cards (Heroic stays out of
 *    scope, §4, so at most two are ever drawn against a three-wide row,
 *    leaving the third slot empty rather than stretching to fill it).
 *  - **MODULAR SETS** ("N REQUIRED · N CHOSEN") — a wrapped grid, the
 *    scenario's own required set(s) first (ink-filled, not toggleable),
 *    then every candidate modular set.
 *  - **SEATING & FIRST PLAYER** — one row of seat cards, with a small quiet
 *    "Random" control on the header's own line.
 *  - **THE ENCOUNTER DECK YOU'RE BUILDING** ("N CARDS · SHUFFLED AT DEAL")
 *    — three equal bordered panels (Composition / What's in there / Nemesis
 *    sets held back) filling the rest of the body's own height.
 *
 * The sidebar carries "THE GAME YOU'LL GET" (six label/value rows), a rule,
 * the seed field with Reroll and its own helper text, and the single red
 * "Deal it out" pinned at the sidebar's own foot.
 *
 * **Narrow (phone/tabletPortrait), read against the owner's own P12
 * screenshot and the coordinator's tablet-portrait note ("adapt D05: portrait
 * stacks it under the body with DEAL IT OUT in a sticky footer"):** no room
 * for a second column, so the whole screen is one **ink** ground and one
 * column (`title-menu-layout.ts`'s own "no split" convention), and every
 * section is drawn compactly rather than at the wide layout's own card sizes
 * — P12 draws Modular sets and First player as dense list/row controls, not
 * the wide layout's description cards, and this module follows that same
 * compaction for Difficulty too, for the same reason (P12 doesn't carry a
 * difficulty picker at all, but the setup flow needs one on every form
 * factor — dropping a legal choice on one device would be the client
 * inventing a rule, so it stays, just compact). Seating draws as **one**
 * horizontal row of small cards, Random included as its own dashed cell (P12
 * embeds it in the row; the wide layout, per the owner's correction, keeps it
 * on the section-header line instead — two different homes for the same
 * control, each matching its own screenshot).
 *
 * Difficulty, modular sets and seating stay at their full, real, functional
 * sizes — they're controls, never trimmed. "Deal it out" pins to the
 * screen's own foot as a sticky footer, like the board's action bar
 * ("content scrolls under the bar", `view/layout.ts`). Whatever vertical
 * room is left above it goes to the encounter-deck panels first and then the
 * game-summary block, **laid out sequentially** — the panels get their real
 * height (trimmed row-first, down to zero rows, never negative), then the
 * summary block starts exactly where the panels actually ended, so the two
 * can never overlap by construction (a fixed pre-split of the same room, tried
 * first, could let one block's real minimum height run into the other's
 * fixed start — this doesn't have that failure mode). On a wide-enough
 * narrow viewport (tablet portrait) the three panels still sit side by side,
 * exactly like the wide layout; only true phone width stacks them.

// Phone: `tableSetupCompactLayout` (2026-09-18 correction).

// The owner: "Don't compress D05 onto a phone — build P12." `narrowLayout` above (still used for tablet portrait,
// >= 700px wide, where the owner's own D05-stacked adaptation reads fine) trims the two description-only blocks
// down to whatever fits above a fixed-height page — which, on an actual phone width with a real four-seat/six-
// modular-set table, meant an empty "THE GAME YOU'LL GET" and two encounter-deck panels crushed to bare title
// bars. P12 draws none of that trimming: it's a **scrolling paper page** — real, full-height content, and the
// page moves instead of the content shrinking. `tableSetupCompactLayout` is that composition:
//
//  - **Ground**: paper (not ink) — P12's own `background:#F4EFE3`. The ink top bar carries a square "◂" icon
//    button (not "◂ Seats" text — P12's own compact icon), the Bangers title, and a small "4/4" label.
//  - **One scrollable region** between the top bar and a sticky ink footer (`McScrollRegion`, `ui/scroll-region.ts`
//    — wheel + touch-drag + momentum, reusing this module's own `VariableListScroll`). Every section below is
//    real, full height, laid out top to bottom in **content space** (`rows`, each a stable id plus a height —
//    used for the scroll math and for `scrollIntoView`, not for drawing: the scene draws each row at its own
//    real position and lets `McScrollRegion` translate the whole thing).
//  - **DIFFICULTY** (not in P12 — Standard/Expert has to live *somewhere* on every form factor, or the client
//    would be dropping a legal choice on phone alone): a compact two-to-three-cell segmented row, ink fill =
//    selected, no description text — that's what wide's own cards carry, and there's a whole page to scroll on
//    phone instead of cramming prose into a 44px row.
//  - **MODULAR SETS**: full-width checkbox rows, exactly P12's own shape — the required set ink-filled with a red
//    checked box and "locked", a chosen candidate paper with an ink-filled checked box, an available candidate
//    paper with an empty box. The right label ("N REQUIRED · N CHOSEN") sits on the header's own line when it
//    fits (`sectionHeaderInlineFits`), else on its own line below — a real layout decision (it changes the
//    header's own height), not left to `fitText`'s shrink-then-ellipsize the way a *plain* header does.
//  - **FIRST PLAYER**: one row of compact chips (as many as there are seats, plus a dashed "Random"), sharing the
//    row equally.
//  - **SHUFFLE SEED**: a parchment bordered row, label/caption at left, the seed field (still the real
//    DOM-backed `McTextInput`) and Reroll at right.
//  - **THE ENCOUNTER DECK**: one bordered paper panel — composition rows (obligations red), then what's-in-there
//    rows, then a single dim "N cards on standby" line (not the full nemesis sentence — P12 has no room for prose
//    here either, and the count is the fact that matters). Every row real, none trimmed; the panel is simply as
//    tall as its real content and the page scrolls to it.
//  - **Sticky footer**: one uppercase summary line ("RHINO · STANDARD I · 1 HERO · 1 MODULAR") above the single
//    red "DEAL IT OUT ▸" fill with a paper outline — P12's own shape exactly.
