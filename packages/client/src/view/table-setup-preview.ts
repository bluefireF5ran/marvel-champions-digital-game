/**
 * Table setup's "the game you'll get" (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 W2, D05):
 * villain total HP, starting threat, encounter deck size and obligation
 * count, for the seats actually chosen — unlike Scenario select's detail
 * panel (`view/scenario-detail.ts`), which shows the same numbers unscaled
 * because it runs before a player count exists.
 *
 * **Never a re-derivation of a rule.** Starting threat and villain HP are
 * `@mc/engine`'s own `scale(value, playerCount)` applied to the printed
 * `ScalingValue`s — the same function `maxHitPoints`/`mainSchemeValue` use at
 * runtime, just called ahead of a game existing. Encounter deck size and
 * obligation count are read straight off `view/encounter-preview.ts`'s
 * `EncounterDeckPreview` (S3, already landed) rather than counted again here.
 *
 * **`config` is a `GameSetupConfig`** the caller already built with
 * `buildScenario`/`coreScenario` for the draft's current scenario, difficulty,
 * modular sets and seated players — the same object `EngineSessionCore.start`
 * would hand to `createGame`, and the same one `encounterDeckPreviewOf` reads
 * (`view/encounter-preview.ts`'s own doc comment on why this is safe: pure,
 * side-effect-free data assembly, not a `GameState`).
 *
 * **Villain total HP is a display rollup, not a rule.** "How much HP does
 * this whole fight have" sums every stage's HP across the difficulty's own
 * stage range (RRG 1.8 Appendix II; `Scenario.villainStages`) — nothing about
 * damage, defeat order or overkill is decided here, only printed numbers
 * added together, the same descriptive-not-rules-query line `view/deck-stats.ts`
 * (S1) already draws for a deck's cost curve. "Extreme" (Breakout's own
 * challenge: every villain's version A in play with its B underneath, RRG
 * insert "Adjustable Difficulty") has no single `Scenario.villainStages` range
 * of its own, so it's the union of `standard` and `expert`'s ranges — version
 * A's stage plus version B's, exactly the two stages that challenge plays
 * through.
 *
 * **Extended for the owner's D05 correction (2026-09-18):** the desktop
 * screenshot the owner sent draws three specific panels ("COMPOSITION",
 * "WHAT'S IN THERE", "NEMESIS SETS HELD BACK" — `compositionRowsOf`/
 * `whatsInThereRowsOf`/`nemesisStandbyOf`) plus a label/value sidebar ("THE
 * GAME YOU'LL GET" — `gameSummaryRowsOf`/`TableSetupPreview`'s own new
 * fields) and a difficulty card row with a real, derived one-line description
 * per difficulty (`difficultyCardsFor`) rather than the plain text dump this
 * module used to produce. Every new number here is still read off
 * `EncounterDeckPreview`/`@mc/engine`'s `scale` exactly as before — nothing
 * added here restates a rule or invents a count `@mc/content` doesn't carry.
