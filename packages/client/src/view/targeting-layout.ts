/**
 * The targeting panel's layout (design canvases D09 "Targeting", L06 "Inspect & target").
 *
 * Composition, read off the rendered canvases (docs/design-reference.md): a full-width Hero Red title bar —
 * "CHOOSE A TARGET" plus the source and its effect, "CANCEL · ESC" pinned to the right — over a paper ground; below
 * it a "N LEGAL TARGETS" rule, then the legal targets as a row of full card tiles (art, name, outcome). Desktop
 * (D09) gives the "Why not the others?" reasoning its own boxed column beside that row, sized to whatever width the
 * targets don't need. Tablet landscape (L06) spends that same width on the inspector rail instead — the source
 * card's full text beside the target list, "replacing the phone sheet" (its own caption) — so the "why not"
 * reasoning moves under the target row there, in the exact spot L06 draws its own per-target rationale strip.
 * Anything narrower than that (tablet portrait, phone) has room for one column only: target tiles stacked above the
 * "why not" reasoning, no rail — the source card is still one tap away through the ordinary Inspect overlay, the
 * same as everywhere else on the table.
 *
 * Pure function of `bounds` (and, at the boundary, a target count for the row's own tile width) — no text
 * measurement, no Phaser, so it is testable and stays in step with `boardLayout`'s own breakpoints (`layout.ts`'s
 * `formFactorFor`) rather than inventing a second set.
