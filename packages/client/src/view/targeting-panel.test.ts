/**
 * The targeting panel's wording, against hand-built `OutcomePreview` fixtures — `preview()`'s own correctness is
 * the engine's job (`packages/engine/src/preview.test.ts`); this only proves the panel words what `preview` already
 * said correctly, without restating a rule. A real-engine integration test at the bottom proves the wiring itself:
 * that `targetingPanelOf` builds the same command a dispatch would and reads a real `preview()` result.
