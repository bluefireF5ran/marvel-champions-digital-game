/**
 * The targeting panel (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 "W5"; design canvases D09, L06): what the board's existing
 * target-select mode (`scenes/board/controller.ts`'s `Selection.kind === "targeting"`) shows once a pulsing ring on
 * the board isn't enough on its own — each legal target's outcome, and why every other card in play isn't one.
 *
 * Every number is the engine's own `preview()` (docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §2 "S5.1–S5.3"); every "why not" reason
 * is the engine's own — `LegalAction.blockedTargets`' already-worded `message` for a basic attack/thwart or an
 * action ability, or `choiceExclusions`' bare `ExclusionCode` (worded through `highlights.ts`'s own table) for a
 * pending `chooseTarget`/`declareDefender`. This module computes no rule of its own: it builds the exact command a
 * dispatch would use (the caller passes `buildCommand`, since the actual re-aiming logic — `retarget` — already
 * lives in `scenes/board/selection.ts`, and a `view/*` module must not import from `scenes/*`), reads what the
 * engine says would happen, and words it — mostly `view/log-lines.ts`'s own phrasing in the future tense, per
 * docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md's S5.2 note that a preview panel is "mostly `logLine` in the future tense".
