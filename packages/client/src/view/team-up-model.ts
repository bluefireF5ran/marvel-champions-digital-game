 * controls. This module asks the engine's `characterTitledAs` for each match rather than reading titles itself, so
 * the Board's badge and the engine's "can I play this card?" cannot disagree.
 *

 * pairs a game could actually use matter: a pair is **relevant** when one of its names is a seated identity or a card
 * in a seated player's deck. The scene draws a badge for each active pair that has art, and a splash the first time
