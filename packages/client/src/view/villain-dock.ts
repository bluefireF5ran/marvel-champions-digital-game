/**
 * Where the villain phase sits against the table (the 2026-10-14 redesign, `artifacts/design-screenshots/villain-phase/`,
 * issues #117, #128, #129, #138).
 *
 * The old walkthrough covered the whole screen, so the table and the hand vanished exactly when the player had to
 * decide whether to spend a card on an interrupt. The redesign keeps them in view:
 *  - **rail** (desktop, D1/D2): the phase docks on the right, under the chrome band; the table and hand lay themselves
 *    out in what is left (`LayoutOptions.villainDock`).
 *  - **band** (tablet landscape, T1): the phase takes the villain band; the hero, play area and hand stay below.
 *  - **tab** (phone and tablet portrait, P1/P2/T2): the phase takes everything between the chrome and the hand, and its
 *    own buttons sit where the action bar is, at the thumb.
 *  - **peek** (P3): the player looks at the table while the phase waits; the phase keeps only a banner over the action
 *    bar with its decision and a way back.
 *  - **full**: the old full-screen panel, kept for "Show the table beside it" off (S1) and for the phone in landscape,
 *    which has no room beside or below the table.
 * The recap (D3/T3/P4) is always full screen.
 *
 * Pure: `scenes/board.ts` turns the request into rectangles off its own layout, and `scenes/villain-phase.ts` draws
 * into them.
