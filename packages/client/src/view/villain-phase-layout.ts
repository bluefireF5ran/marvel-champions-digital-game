/**
 * The villain-phase walkthrough's own layout (D11, P09, L02;
 * docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md §3 "W7").
 *
 * The canvas is a full-bleed ink panel, not a centered card
 * (`overlay-layout.ts`'s shape is for a menu; this screen is a HUD over the
 * table). Composition, read off the renders:
 *  - **Desktop (D11), tablet landscape and tablet portrait (L02):** header
 *    (title + Skip), subtitle, the five-step strip, then a two-column split
 *    down to the footer — a wide **main column** ("happening now"'s
 *    breakdown, the boost cards it revealed, and "queued this phase") beside
 *    a narrower **rail**. The rail's own content differs by width class: L02
 *    draws a per-seat **"TEAM STATUS"** list above the main-scheme threat
 *    callout — the one place the design keeps everyone's HP visible while the
 *    walkthrough (or its inline interrupt window) is covering the board
 *    underneath — and drops the phase log entirely (the step strip and "queued
 *    this phase" already narrate it). Desktop keeps D11's own rail instead:
 *    the main-scheme callout on top of the phase log, no team status. Tablet
 *    portrait gets the same rail as landscape — the canvases don't draw a
 *    portrait villain phase separately, and L01/L02's own point (a persistent
 *    rail rather than phone's tabs) applies to both tablet orientations.
 *  - **Phone (P09):** one stacked column — the step strip collapses to a
 *    single "Step N of 5" line (five bordered chips don't fit at 390px, the
 *    same reasoning `Board - Phone` already applies to its own tab rail) —
 *    and the rail's own panel (main scheme, then the phase log) drops below
 *    "queued" rather than sitting beside it. No team status on phone either:
 *    phone is already one seat's own view, tab-switched, not a multi-seat rail.
 *
 * Pure function of `bounds` and the form factor — no text measurement,
 * matching every other layout module's own rule.
