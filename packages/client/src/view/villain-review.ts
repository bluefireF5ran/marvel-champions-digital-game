/**
 * The villain phase tucked away for review (the owner's request, 2026-10-14): once the recap closes into the player
 * phase, the round's villain phase stays one press away, on a drawer handle at the table's edge, until the next villain
 * phase replaces it. Pressing it brings the same recap back over the table, read-only, with Close.
 *
 * Pure: the snapshot the recap needs (the phase's walkthrough, the game before it and after it), and the rules for
 * when the Board shows the handle and which way the docked phase slides.
