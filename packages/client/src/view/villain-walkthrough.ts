/**
 * The villain phase, replayed as the design's five-step walkthrough.
 *
 * The engine runs a whole villain phase inside one command, so the auto-
 * advancing screen in `Screens - Desktop` can't be driven by asking the engine
 * "what step are you on" — it has to be reconstructed from that command's
 * `GameEvent` stream (PLAN.md Phase 4, "villain phase as a walkthrough"). This
 * module does exactly that, and nothing else: no rules, no engine calls.
 *
 * Where the engine parked a `PendingChoice`, the walkthrough stops and labels
 * why that player is the one deciding, using `PendingChoice.authority`. That is
 * the whole point of the tag — Phase 3 established that the villain never
 * chooses, so every pause here is a player's decision made on the encounter
 * side's behalf, and the screen should say which rule put it there
 * (docs/phase3-encounter-ai.md).
