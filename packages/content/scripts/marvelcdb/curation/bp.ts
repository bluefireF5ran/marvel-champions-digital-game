/**
 * Black Panther/Shuri Hero Pack (Cycle 9) curation. Evidence abbreviations:
 * - "raw": the pack's own cached raw record (`packages/content/raw/marvelcdb/bp.json`).
 * - "card image": the printed card, viewed directly at `https://marvelcdb.com/bundles/cards/<code>.jpg`
 *   (verification only, no bytes stored — CLAUDE.md "Content & IP boundaries").
 *
 * Not to be confused with Core's own Black Panther (T'Challa) — this is the later (2025) Shuri hero pack, Cycle 9
 * per the Hall of Heroes card database navigation (https://hallofheroeslcg.com/browse/).
 *
 * **Parser fix landed alongside this pack, not curation-specific** (`parse-text.ts`, `normalize/player-cards.ts`):
 * the printed keyword "Linked (Card Title)." (RRG 1.8 p. 27, "cards with the linked keyword cannot be included in
 * a player's deck") was never recognized at all — it fell through as plain text, and a Linked card's missing
 * `deck_limit` failed the "must have a positive deck_limit" check with no exemption. Redemption (51036, "Linked
 * (Show of Empathy). Victory 0.") is this pack's example and the first Linked card this pipeline has ingested;
 * the fix is generic (any pack, any Linked card), not scoped to Black Panther.
 *
 * One curated correction: Redemption's printed dash cost, confirmed against the card image (no numbered cost
 * circle at top-left, just a horizontal dash — matches RRG 1.8 "Dash (Value)", p. 15, and a Linked card entering
 * play only "by the card title in the parentheses following the keyword" rather than being played from hand).
