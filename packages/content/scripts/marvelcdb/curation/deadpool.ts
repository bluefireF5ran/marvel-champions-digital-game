  // Scripting hand-off notes (docs/phase7-wave7-data-survey.md §8 step 12), comments only so the emitted data does not
  // change. Reading taken, question or ruling behind it (docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1), script under
  // packages/cards/src/wave7/deadpool/. No dotted acronym traits here (docs/trait-split-report.md: no change).
  // - 44001a The Regeneratin' Degenerate: a genuine "would be defeated" replacement, so it resolves before any "is
  //   defeated" interrupt and is not offered together with them for ordering (2026-10-06, RRG 1.8 "Would"). Hero face
  //   only; Wade Wilson at 0 hit points is defeated. When he cannot change form it resolves as far as it can: the dial
  //   goes to 1 and the token is added (Q45 = A). 44028 Git Gud's forced interrupt is heard in the same window.
  //   identity.ts, support-upgrades-allies.ts.
  // - 44028 Git Gud: the cost reduction is read in hand from an outside fact. A game is one finished as a win or a
  //   loss;
  //   an abandoned session is not a game; no history means "did not win"; the result is snapshotted at setup (Q48,
  //   2026-10-06 one definition everywhere). support-upgrades-allies.ts.
  // - 44046 Break Time: Alliance and the per-player cost are data. The minutes are wall-clock time from playing the
  //   card, including time backgrounded, whole minutes rounded down, no cap, stored in the log by `reportFact`; the
  //   player who played it ends the break (Q49; the 1,440-minute cap on the client was confirmed as a product choice,
  //   2026-10-06). pack-cards.ts.
  // - 44032 The Merc with the Mouth: no "When Revealed" header, so the three sentences are one standing constant, one
  //   `-constant` ref (2026-10-05, RRG 1.8 "Ability", p. 4). Exhausted allies stay exhausted and new ones enter
  //   exhausted. Other players cannot resolve player card abilities during your turn, forced ones and Plot Convenience
  //   included ("cannot" wins, RRG p. 11). The talking check is Q50, via `reportFact`. obligation-nemesis.ts.
  // - 44035 Tabula Rasa 16: both faces' text boxes are blank (Q12 = A), so the regeneration does not apply.
  // - 44004 Maximum Effort, 44006 "Yoo-Hoo!": the payer may take 0 damage; the event then does nothing but counts as
  //   played (Q46 = B), and 0 damage opens no damage window (2026-10-06). events.ts.
  // - 44023 'Pool Inspection: "ignoring the crisis icon" covers the first sentence only (2026-10-06, as built).
  //   44024 Live Dangerously counts Dreadful Deeds 44039 (as built). events.ts, support-upgrades-allies.ts.
  // - 44009 Armed to the Teeth: the swap turns up a WEAPON from "your collection", the five aspects' WEAPON upgrades in
  //   the app's playable pool with copy accounting (Q47 = A). A restricted weapon turned up resolves, then the
  //   restricted limit is enforced by discards (2026-10-06). support-upgrades-allies.ts.
  // - 44050 Plot Convenience: any player triggers it and may take any attached card whoever owns it (Q53 = A), but the
  //   Merc stops it during the Merc player's turn. 44053 Blackout: one option per resource type, a wild resource is
  //   spent as the type its player declares (Q51 = A); it takes threat off a scheme the way a move does, so under a
  //   crisis icon with no other scheme the Action cannot be started and nothing is spent (2026-10-06, RRG "Move",
  //   p. 30). 44056 Rock, Paper, Scissors and 44057 Tic-Tac-Toe use the scan's diagrams (spec §3.84, §3.87); 44058
  //   War reads star and boost icons. pack-cards.ts.
  // - 44055 Laser Swords: "counts as 2 restricted cards" is `restrictedWeight`: one restricted card weighing 2, seen by
  //   text that names restricted cards and offered for the limit's discard (contributor's rules call 2026-10-16
  //   (bluefireF5ran), reverses upstream Q52 = B). With Psylocke's two Katanas it can never stay in play. A restricted
  //   card played over the limit resolves, then the player discards down (2026-10-06). pack-cards.ts.
  // - 44037 Crisis of Infinite Deadpools and the Dreadpool set: auto-included exactly when a seat chose 'Pool (Q44 = A,
  //   `encounterSets` above); the rest of the set starts set aside. 44041 'Pool-ized carries the RRG 1.8 erratum
  //   (`errata` above). dreadpool.ts.
  // - 44047 Get in Front of Me!, 44048 Mulligan: a defender who has left play still counts; "another card this phase"
  //   counts the player's own plays across the whole player phase. pack-cards.ts.
