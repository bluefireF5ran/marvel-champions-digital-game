/**
 * Fear No Evil (MC46) encounter cards, group A: the Bullseye (60065 to 60075), Electro (60076 to 60085) and
 * Hammerhead (60086 to 60096) villain sets. MarvelCDB has none of the box's scenario half (survey §3), so each card
 * is transcribed from its Hall of Heroes scan (`<collector>.jpg` and `_2` / `_3` copies in the scan download folder;
 * read directly, never wired into the data). Records are shaped like the fne.json records MarvelCDB does carry
 * (sparse keys, omitted when null), without the reference fields MarvelCDB would invent (`url`, `octgn_id`,
 * `imagesrc`).
 *
 * Conventions shared by every record below:
 * - A row of N red boost icons is `boost: N`; a leading star in that row is `boost_star: true`.
 * - A bare star where a stat numeral would be (no number printed) leaves the stat omitted (null) and sets the
 *   matching `*_star`; the value comes from the text. "0*" / "1*" (numeral plus star) keeps the numeral.
 * - The wing-and-plus icon on a scheme is the amplify icon (the same glyph as on 60034 Deadliest Man Alive, whose
 *   fne.json record has `scheme_amplify: 1`; the acceleration icon is a plus over a house, see 56025).
 * - A copy count above one is `quantity`; `set_position` is the first copy's N of the printed N/14.
 * - `text` is MarvelCDB markup: `[star]` for the printed star before a line, `<hr />` before the boost line,
 *   `[boost]` / `[per_hero]` / resource icons as MarvelCDB writes them.
