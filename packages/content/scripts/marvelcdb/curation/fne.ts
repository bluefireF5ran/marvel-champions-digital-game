/**
 * Fear No Evil (MC60, cycle 11) curation: a campaign expansion with two heroes (Daredevil, Echo) and six scenarios
 * (Kingpin plus Bullseye, Electro and Purple Man, mixed and matched). MarvelCDB carries the 66 player-side records
 * (60001 to 60064 with the three Photographic Reflexes printings); the scenario half (60065 to 60210) is transcribed
 * in `fne-encounter/` and joins as `addedRecords`.
 *
 * Evidence abbreviations: "scan" is `assets/card-art/bundles/cards/<code>.png` (gitignored, read directly, never wired
 * into the data), "MC60 p. N" is the box rulebook (docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc60_fear_no_evil.md, printed pages),
 * "RRG" is the v1.8 rules reference, "survey" is docs/phase7-wave11-data-survey.md and "spec" is docs/phase7-wave11.md.
 *
 * - Daredevil's Sense deck (60002 to 60006) is a `separateDecks` entry on 60001a, fixed order and open to its owner
 *   (spec section 1.1); its cards file under `daredevil_sense_deck`, resolved to the hero by `auxiliaryHeroSetCodes`.
 * - Photographic Reflexes is three records (60040a/b/c, two copies each, the "(x6)" of MC60 p. 25), kept as three
 *   cards (spec section 1.2). Its cost is a printed star.
