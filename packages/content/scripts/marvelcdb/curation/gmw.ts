/**
 * Galaxy's Most Wanted (Cycle 3 in this repo's numbering — see below) curation: Groot, Rocket Raccoon and five
 * scenarios (Brotherhood of Badoon, Infiltrate the Museum, Escape the Museum, Nebula, Ronan the Accuser).
 * docs/phase7-wave3.md is the shared spec this pass closes out (§1.1, §1.2, §1.4, §1.7, §2.2, §4 Q3/Q7, §5).
 *
 * Evidence abbreviations:
 * - "raw": `packages/content/raw/marvelcdb/gmw.json`.
 * - "MC16 p.N": `docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc16_galaxys_most_wanted.md` (converted from
 *   `docs/campaign-modes/mc16_galaxys_most_wanted_rules_website-compressed.pdf`), cited by its printed page.
 * - "RRG 1.8 p.66/67": `docs/rules/mc_rulesreference_v18_compressed.pdf`'s printed errata page.
 * - "wave3 §N": docs/phase7-wave3.md section N.
 *
 * **Cycle id.** `stld`/`gam`/`drax`/`vnm` (the four hero packs released alongside this box) are already emitted
 * under `cycle: { id: "cycle3", ... }` — kept here for consistency with those siblings rather than switched to a
 * "cycle2" id that would split one FFG cycle across two `CycleId`s in this repo's data. (FFG's own cycle numbering
 * calls Galaxy's Most Wanted "Cycle 2"; this repo's `id: "cycle3"` is an internal label carried over from before
 * this pack was curated, not a disagreement with FFG.)
 *
 * **The Collector's villain shape (wave3 §1.1, landed in `game-rules-architect`'s schema pass and
 * `normalize/villains.ts`'s `MODE_LABEL_RE` branch, this pass).** Escape the Museum's Collector prints `"A1"`/
 * `"A2"` (standard) and `"B1"`/`"B2"` (expert) — two physical double-sided villain cards sharing one
 * `card_set_code` (`escape_the_museum`), not two stages of one card. `normalizeVillains` now emits each mode as
 * its own single-stage, two-sided `VillainCard` (`16080a` standard, `16081a` expert) and leaves `villainIdBySet`
 * unset for the set (the same convention The Once and Future Kang's colliding-stage sets use), so the scenario
 * below names each card directly (`villainCardCode` / `expertVillains.villainCardCode`).
 *
 * **The Collector's back face is infinite HP, not "no HP printed"** (`VillainStage.infiniteHp`, wave3 §1.1):
 * raw `health: 0` on `16080b`/`16081b`. Its ATK/SCH are **not** dashed — `16080b` (standard) prints explicit
 * `attack: 0, scheme: 0` and `16081b` (expert) prints `attack: 2, scheme: 2`, unchanged from its front face — see
 * wave3 §1.1's own table. **Q7 answer, confirmed against the printed card images** (fetched
 * `marvelcdb.com/bundles/cards/16080b.png` and `16081b.png` and viewed directly this pass — not stored anywhere in
 * the repo, per CLAUDE.md's art boundary): 16080b ("A2") prints solid numeral badges reading **"0" SCH / "0"
 * ATK**, and 16081b ("B2") prints **"2" SCH / "2" ATK** — plainly "0"/"2", not the dashed "—" stat-box art RRG 1.8
 * "Dash (Value)" (p. 15) describes elsewhere. Both cards also print "HIT POINTS ∞" in their footer, confirming
 * `infiniteHp` against the card face directly rather than only against raw's `health: 0` encoding.
 *
 * **Campaign Challenge side schemes are emitted one card per face** (wave3 §1.4, landed in
 * `normalize/single-cards.ts`'s side-scheme flip-side branch, this pass): `16178a`/`16178b` … `16182a`/`16182b`,
 * each its own `SideSchemeCard` (no `flipSide` — that field doesn't exist on `SideSchemeCard`). Nothing flips
 * them in play; a campaign setup instruction (not built yet, C2) picks the face.
 *
 * **Owner reclassification, 2026-10-04: Campaign Challenge (`challenge`) is `campaignSpecific`** (curation `encounterSets`
 * below), reversing the Q3 note for that set only; Badoon Headhunter stays modular, as follows.
 *
 * **Badoon Headhunter (wave3 §4 Q3), settled directly by the RRG's own FAQ.** RRG 1.8's "Galaxy's Most Wanted
 * Expansion", "Modular Encounter Sets" (p. 61): "Q: In the Galaxy's Most Wanted Expansion, which sets are
 * considered modular encounter sets? A: If an encounter set is not scenario-specific (containing the name of that
 * scenario in its encounter set name area) or campaign-specific (containing the word 'Campaign' in its encounter
 * set name area), then it is modular. The eight modular encounter sets in the Galaxy's Most Wanted Expansion are:
 * Badoon Headhunter, Band of Badoon, Galactic Artifacts, Kree Militants, Menagerie Medley, Power Stone, Space
 * Pirates, and Ship Command." (Also in `docs/rules/mc_rulesreference_v18_compressed.md`, the plain-text conversion, ~line
 * 4492 — no page markers there, so the citation above is checked against the PDF directly.) MC16 p. 4 calls cards
 * #178–187 (Campaign Challenge *and* Badoon Headhunter) "campaign-specific encounter cards" — a looser, plain-
 * English use of the phrase than the FAQ's own defined term, which the FAQ answer itself resolves for the schema:
 * modular is the RRG's residual category once scenario-specific and campaign-specific (the printed "Campaign"
 * word) are excluded, and Badoon Headhunter is named in the modular list explicitly. **Answer: modular, not
 * schema-`campaignSpecific`.** Raw agrees structurally: both Badoon Headhunter's and Campaign Challenge's cards
 * carry `faction_code: "encounter"`, not `"campaign"` — unlike The Market (`the_market`, `faction_code:
 * "campaign"` on every card), which does print the "Campaign" word (RRG 1.8 "Campaign-Specific Card", p. 11:
 * "designated by the word 'Campaign' printed at the bottom of the card"). `EncounterSet.campaignSpecific` tracks
 * that printed word, which neither set carries, so `normalizeEncounterSets` (unchanged this pass) correctly
 * leaves both `false`. Neither set appears in any scenario's `recommendedModularSetCodes` below regardless (none
 * of the five 1A "Contents" texts name them — confirmed against raw): both are introduced only by campaign setup
 * (not built yet, C2), so standalone play never draws either on its own.
 *
 * **Precons: Groot (Protection) and Rocket Raccoon (Aggression), MC16 p. 20**, transcribed item-by-item and
 * cross-checked against raw by name, code and quantity — every item matched exactly (including the two "Nemesis
 * set" lines printed together under Rocket's own section: Rocket's own nemesis set — Vendetta, Blackjack O'Hare,
 * Blackjack's Bazooka, Planetary Invasion x2 — and Groot's — Blazing Inferno, Furnax, Fan the Flames x3 — each
 * cross-checked against its own identity's `nemesisEncounterSetId` rather than assumed from page position).
