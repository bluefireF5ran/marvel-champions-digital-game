/**
 * Ironheart (Riri Williams) Hero Pack (Cycle 5) curation.
 *
 * **Not a three-sided identity (Ant-Man/Wasp's shape, docs/phase7-wave2.md §1.1) — three separate, complete
 * hero/alter-ego identity pairs**, one physical two-sided card each: 29001a/29001b (Version 1, hand size 4),
 * 29002a/29002b (Version 2, hand size 5), 29003a/29003b (Version 3, hand size 6). Confirmed from each hero
 * face's own printed text ("Version 1."/"Version 2."/"Version 3." trait-line, `real_traits`) and each Level Up!
 * ability ("swap her with VERSION 2/3 Ironheart") and 29001b's own "Begin the game with this card. Set your
 * other identities aside." This already normalizes correctly as three separate `HeroIdentityCard`s with no
 * normalizer change needed — `normalizeHeroes` doesn't require a set to contain exactly one identity pair.
 *
 * **No `imageOverrides` entry needed for 29002a/29002b/29003a/29003b**, though MarvelCDB has no `imagesrc` at
 * all for any of the four (`imagesrc: null` on all four raw records — Version 1's pair, 29001a/29001b, does have
 * art). Hall of Heroes' own Ironheart release-page gallery (https://hallofheroeslcg.com/ironheart-riri-williams/)
 * hosts a second, independent scan for all six identity faces (`i0a.jpg`–`i0f.jpg`); each was fetched and viewed
 * directly and matched to its card by title, printed text, hand size/hit points and the collector mark in the
 * corner:
 * - `i0a.jpg` = "1B" (Riri Williams, Version 1) — already covered by MarvelCDB's own 29001b art; not used.
 * - `i0b.jpg` = "2B" (Riri Williams, Version 2) → 29002b.
 * - `i0c.jpg` = "3B" (Riri Williams, Version 3) → 29003b.
 * - `i0d.jpg` = "1A" (Ironheart, Version 1) — already covered by MarvelCDB's own 29001a art; not used.
 * - `i0e.jpg` = "2A" (Ironheart, Version 2) → 29002a.
 * - `i0f.jpg` = "3A" (Ironheart, Version 3) → 29003a.
 * `scripts/fetch_card_art.py` fetched and trimmed each to `assets/card-art/bundles/cards/<code>.png`, and
 * `withLocalArt` (`scripts/marvelcdb/normalize/art.ts`) picks up any `<code>.png` under that folder for a record
 * with no `imagesrc` of its own — the same fallback `jubilee.ts`/`psylocke.ts` describe — so no curation entry
 * is needed once the scan exists locally (an `imageOverrides` entry for a code `withLocalArt` already covers
 * fails `checkCoverage`'s "matched no face that needed it" check).
 *
 * Otherwise normalizes cleanly — the schema-neutral parser fixes (docs/phase7-wave2-data.md) already cover every
 * other shape this pack uses.
 *
 * **`progressingIdentity` (docs/phase7-wave5.md §1.4).** The Ironheart insert, "New Rules: Progressing Identity
 * Cards" (read as an image 2026-09-26, not stored): all three versions share one hit point dial, and 29001a
 * (Version 1) is the one whose alter-ego (29001b) prints "Begin the game with this card." Set on all three hero
 * records, weakest first, so `HeroIdentityCard.progressingIdentity.versions` is `["29001a", "29002a", "29003a"]`
 * on every one of them (schema requires the card list itself, not just the first version's).
 *
 * **Precon (docs/phase7-wave5.md §1.9, §5; docs/phase7-wave5-sources.md §5):** transcribed 2026-09-26 from the
 * pack's own printed decklist card, "Ironheart Deck", https://hallofheroeslcg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/card.jpg
 * (fetched via `scripts/fetch_card_art.py grab`, viewed directly, not stored — CLAUDE.md "Content & IP
 * boundaries"). Uses Version 1 (`29001a`, the "Begin the game with this card" identity, §1.4) as `identityCode` —
 * the only version whose alter-ego prints "Begin the game with this card. Set your other identities aside.".
 * Every card code and quantity cross-checked against `raw/marvelcdb/ironheart.json`'s own `quantity`/`deck_limit`
 * fields (all 10 hero-kit cards at full printed quantity); no second source found for this pack's precon as of
 * this pass.
