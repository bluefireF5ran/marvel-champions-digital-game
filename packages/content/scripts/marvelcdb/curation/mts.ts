/**
 * The Mad Titan's Shadow (MC21, Cycle 4) curation — the box: Spectrum and Adam Warlock hero kits, five scenarios
 * (Ebony Maw, Tower Defense, Thanos, Hela, Loki), seven modular sets (Black Order, Armies of Titan, Children of
 * Thanos, Infinity Gauntlet, Legions of Hel, Frost Giants, Enchantress) and The Mad Titan's Shadow Campaign set
 * (cards 180–193). docs/phase7-wave4.md §1, §2.2 is the working spec this pass implements; citations below use its
 * section numbers alongside MC21's own printed page (the rulebook conversion, `docs/campaign-modes/markdown/
 * mc21_the_mad_titans_shadow.md`) and RRG 1.8 page numbers.
 *
 * **Six faces have no artwork reference anywhere on MarvelCDB** (checked on the live API, not merely the cached
 * raw file, 2026-09-24) and no independently-viewable second source could be located for any of them either — see
 * `artUnavailable` below for the search each entry documents. Rather than block the whole box on six of 202
 * records, `PackCuration.artUnavailable` (that field's own doc comment) tells `checkCoverage` to treat these six
 * as a confirmed gap instead of a hard error. The client already draws a generated frame for a face with no
 * `image` reference (`packages/client/src/art/art-source.ts`'s `artFor` returns `null` when a face has no
 * `ImageRef` and no local `ArtRef`, and `packages/client/src/art/card-art.ts`'s `request` treats a `null` source
 * as "no texture" rather than erroring — proven for exactly this shape, a villain stage with no `image`, by
 * `art-source.test.ts`'s "returns null for a villain stage with no image" case) — this is that same,
 * already-handled shape, not a new one; the other ~24 pool faces the build's own `vite-card-art.ts` art-coverage
 * log already lists as backed by no local scan render the same way today.

  // docs/phase7-wave4.md §1 (this pass's own finding, not in the original 26-line survey list — see the file
  // header): six MarvelCDB records have no artwork reference at all, on the *live* API as of 2026-09-24, not
  // merely the cached raw file — checked directly (`curl https://marvelcdb.com/api/public/card/21182` and the
  // individual `/bundles/cards/<code>.png` paths, all 404). Every other pack's analogous double-sided-card backs
  // (`hood` 24049b, `gmw` 16178b-16182b) DO have a MarvelCDB-hosted image; these six are a genuine gap in
  // MarvelCDB's own data for this one product, not a normalizer bug, and a second source was searched for and not
  // found for any of them: the MC21 rulebook (both the compressed insert and the campaign log) prints no
  // card-image plates at all; Hall of Heroes' two MC21 release-page galleries (`the-mad-titans-shadow`,
  // `the-mad-titans-shadow-encounters-and-mods`) carry no per-image captions or alt text identifying which of
  // their ~300 combined images is which card, so matching one to Hela's Mystic-side back or Black
  // Swan/Defensive Protocols/Jormungand/Retrieve Odin's Armor without guessing was not possible; a product-photo
  // retailer page (crazyjackalope.com) shows only one thumbnail per listing. CLAUDE.md's IP boundary and
  // `imageOverrides`' own evidence bar both require a second source to be independently viewed before it is
  // cited, so none of these candidates was entered as an `imageOverrides` URL. If one turns up later, prefer that
  // (a real reference beats an acknowledged gap) and drop the matching entry here.
  // MarvelCDB hosts only the A side of each main scheme stage here (the aggregate `21075.png` is stamped "2A"); the
  // B sides were fetched from Hall of Heroes' encounter gallery (assets/card-art/hall-of-heroes-manifest.tsv) and
