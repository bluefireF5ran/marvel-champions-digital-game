/**
 * Mutant Genesis (MC32, cycle 6 campaign box) curation, pass 1: cards only. Colossus and Shadowcat hero kits, five
 * scenarios' encounter cards, the role sets and the campaign cards 171-195. docs/phase7-wave6.md §1 is the working
 * spec; the scenario records, starter decks and the hand-authored `campaign.ts` are later passes (docs/
 * phase7-wave6-data-survey.md §9 steps 4-5), so `scenarios` and `starterDecks` are empty here.
 *
 * Evidence abbreviations: "scan" is `assets/card-art/bundles/cards/<code>.png` (gitignored, read directly; never
 * wired into the data), "RRG" is the v1.8 rules reference, "spec" is docs/phase7-wave6.md. The survey
 * (`survey.ts --pack mut_gen`) reported 21 lines on the bare curation, all resolved below: the three main scheme B
 * sides' dashed threat values, three missing dash costs (32031a, 32171b, 32172b), cardNotes for Robert Kelly and
 * Mystique, and the four attach rules.
