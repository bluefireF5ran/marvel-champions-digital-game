/**
 * Nebula Hero Pack (Cycle 4) curation.
 *
 * - **`22017` ("The Power of Justice") quantity correction**: MarvelCDB sends `quantity: 1` for this record, but
 *   Hall of Heroes' Nebula starter-deck reference card (https://hallofheroeslcg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/
 *   nebula-starter-deck.jpg, transcribed below) lists "17 The Power of Justice x2", and the card's own printed
 *   text is "Max 2 per deck" (no errata) — the same shape as every other pack's analogous "Power of X"/aspect
 *   resource card (e.g. Star-Lord's `17018` "The Power of Leadership", which sends `quantity: 2`). Corrected via
 *   `quantityInSet` below, not treated as errata (the card always had two physical copies; MarvelCDB's own
 *   `quantity` field for this one pack's `duplicate_of_code: "01062"` record undercounts it).
 *
 * - **`22011` ("Eros") errata (RRG 1.8 p. 67)**: "Should read: 'Response: After you play Eros from your hand, for
 *   each [mental] resource you used to pay for him, choose a minion and confuse it.' (Revised wording to function
 *   as intended with updated 'for each' rules.)" MarvelCDB's cached text is still the pre-errata wording ("confuse
 *   a minion for each [mental] resource...", no `errata` field set on the raw record) — applied forward via
 *   `currentReplace` below. The pack's other three errata entries (Cosmo #20, Old Rivals #31 here; James Rhodes
 *   #1B in `warm.ts`; Aragorn #7/Shieldmaiden #11/Beguiled #31 in `valk.ts`; Machine Man #22 in `vision.ts`) are
 *   already reflected in MarvelCDB's cached text (each carries its own raw `errata` note confirming it), so no
 *   further curation was needed for those.
 *
 * Starter deck curated wave 4 (below).
