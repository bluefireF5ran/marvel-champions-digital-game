/**
 * Nova (Sam Alexander) Hero Pack curation. Cycle 5 per the Hall of Heroes card database navigation
 * (https://hallofheroeslcg.com/browse/): Nova, Ironheart, Spider-Ham, Peni Parker/SP//dr, in that release order.
 *
 * Normalizes cleanly with no hand corrections needed once the Requirement multi-icon parser fix (wave 2 schema
 * pass §6.1, docs/phase7-wave2.md) landed — the Spider-Man ally's identical Requirement text is reused here.
 *
 * **Precon (docs/phase7-wave5.md §1.9, §5; docs/phase7-wave5-sources.md §5):** transcribed 2026-09-26 from the
 * pack's own printed decklist card, "Nova Deck", https://hallofheroeslcg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/deck1.jpeg
 * (fetched via `scripts/fetch_card_art.py grab`, viewed directly, not stored — CLAUDE.md "Content & IP
 * boundaries"). Every card code and quantity cross-checked against `raw/marvelcdb/nova.json`'s own `quantity`/
 * `deck_limit` fields (all 8 hero-kit cards at their full printed quantity, matching `normalizeStarterDecks`'
 * exact-kit-quantity rule); no second source found (no MarvelCDB community decklist for this pack as of this
 * pass) — flagged in `note` rather than silently treated as fully cross-checked.
 *
 * **"Bring the War!" (28022, side scheme) has no MarvelCDB text** (`text`/`real_text` both null, checked
 * 2026-09-26 — docs/phase7-wave5.md §1.9). Transcribed from the card's own MarvelCDB bundle image
 * (`https://marvelcdb.com/bundles/cards/28022.png`, fetched via `scripts/fetch_card_art.py grab`, viewed directly
 * 2026-09-26, not stored). No errata in RRG 1.8 pp. 67–68 covers this card; the transcribed text matches ruling
 * Jan 11, 2026 (3) ("Bring the War! vs Supernova Helmet"), which describes a When Revealed discarding cards with
 * a printed [wild] resource.
