/**
 * Shadowland (MC65) Black Flower, a modular set (13 printed copies, collector 72A onward). Conventions in `common.ts`.
 *
 * Creeping Corruption 72A (Setup side) and 72B (OVERPOWERING side) is one double-sided upgrade. The Aka footer is
 * "BLACK FLOWER (5/13)", so positions 1 to 4 are four copies of Creeping Corruption (the insert, pp. 9, 14, puts one into
 * play under each player's control and sets the rest aside; "Max 1 per player" for up to four players). The rest of the
 * set (Aka 5, Tongue of the Beast 6, Binding Ritual 7, Roots of a Black Flower 8 to 9, Malediction 10 to 11, Invasive
 * Thoughts 12 to 13) is transcribed from the full-size scans.
 *
 * Icons: the burst with an exclamation mark is the crisis icon (the glyph of Dead End 42 and the other scheme_crisis
 * records), the house with a plus is acceleration and the card with a plus is hazard (Strategic Positioning 65008).
