/**
 * Shadowland (MC65) scenario records (spec docs/phase7-shadowland.md section 6, task D4), authored the way Fear No Evil's
 * were (`fne.ts` `SCENARIO_RECORDS`): three `ScenarioCuration`s for `shadows-in-the-night`, `shadow-labyrinth` and
 * `heart-of-shadow`, built from the box insert (docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc65_shadowland.md, "insert", printed pages),
 * each scenario's main scheme 1A "Contents" and "Setup" lines, and the transcribed cards in `shadowland-encounter/`.
 * Wired in through `scenarios: SHADOWLAND_SCENARIO_RECORDS` in `shadowland.ts`.
 *
 * Insert facts used: three scenarios in order (p. 4); the three modular sets "can be used in any scenario" (p. 4); Black
 * Flower cannot be a modular set in the campaign (p. 5, see `SHADOWLAND_CAMPAIGN`).
 * Each main scheme's 1A Contents prints "One modular encounter set (Ninja Swarm)", so Ninja Swarm is the recommended
 * modular set of all three. The insert prints no "Encounter Deck" line; the modular pick is the 1A Contents' own.
 *
 * VILLAINS AND STAGES (how the normalizer emits them):
 * - Dark Protege villains (12A to 17A): each villain is ONE double-sided card with sides A (HP 15 per hero) and B (HP 18
 *   per hero), each a single stage 1 (`PackCuration.villainFlipSets`). The main scheme flips A to B (65001B/65002B
 *   Forced Interrupt: "When the villain would be defeated on side A, instead flip it to side B, reset its hit points ...
 *   If the villain is defeated on side B, the players win the game"), so the A->B change is NOT a stage advance:
 *   `villainStages` is [1, 1] in both modes and `victory` is the default `finalVillainStage` (defeat on side B wins).
 * - Krahllak (heart-of-shadow): one card with three one-sided stages I, II, III; Dark Invitation 1A: stages [1, 2] in
 *   standard mode, [2, 3] in expert mode.
 * - Shifting Corridors (shadow-labyrinth): one card, one stage, infinite hit points.
