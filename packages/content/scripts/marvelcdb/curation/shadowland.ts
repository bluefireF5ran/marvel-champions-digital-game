/**
 * Shadowland Scenario Pack (MC65, cycle 11, released 2026-10-16) curation: a scenario pack with no heroes, three
 * scenarios (Shadows in the Night, Shadow Labyrinth, Heart of Shadow), the Dark Protégé villain set and three modular
 * sets (Black Flower, Deadly Contraptions, Ninja Swarm), 90 printed cards. MarvelCDB has no Shadowland pack, so there is
 * no raw cache (`scanOnly`) and every record is an added record transcribed from
 * the Hall of Heroes preview scans (docs/phase7-shadowland.md section 3), as Fear No Evil's scenario half was.
 *
 * Only 45 of the 90 faces have a public scan so far (the page's previews, 300 x 426); the rest are listed in
 * `SHADOWLAND_MISSING_FACES` and are not guessed. The pack is not registered in the content index yet.
 *
 * Evidence abbreviations: "scan" is the Hall of Heroes preview `mc65_cards_<stem>.png` (https://hallofheroeslcg.com/
 * shadowland/; also saved as `assets/card-art/bundles/cards/<code>.png`, gitignored), "insert" is the box rules insert
 * (docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc65_shadowland.md, printed pages) and "spec" is docs/phase7-shadowland.md.
