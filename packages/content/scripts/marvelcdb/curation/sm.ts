/**
 * Sinister Motives (MC27, Cycle 4 campaign box) curation — Ghost-Spider and Spider-Man (Miles Morales) hero kits,
 * five scenarios (Sandman, Venom, Mysterio, The Sinister Six, Venom Goblin), nine modular sets (City in Chaos,
 * Down to Earth, Symbiotic Strength, Personal Nightmare, Whispers of Paranoia, Guerrilla Tactics, Goblin Gear,
 * Osborn Tech, Sinister Assault) and the Sinister Motives Campaign set (cards 174–191). docs/phase7-wave5.md §1,
 * §2 is the working spec this pass implements; citations below use its section numbers alongside MC27's own
 * printed page (the rulebook conversion, `docs/campaign-modes/markdown/mc27_sinister_motives.md`) and RRG 1.8 page
 * numbers.
 *
 * The survey (`survey.ts --pack sm`, 2026-09-26) reports 31 lines, all resolved below: Venom Goblin's lettered main
 * schemes (§1.1, 16 lines — the normalizer itself gained a dedicated code path for this shape,
 * `normalize/main-schemes.ts`'s `normalizeLetteredSchemeChain`, since no existing pair-of-linked-records shape
 * fit), campaign upgrades without a printed cost (8 lines, §1.8), attach rules the parser missed because the
 * attach clause sits inside a `When Revealed:` ability body rather than as its own preamble sentence (2 lines +
 * their 2 "never turned into a card" siblings, §1.9 — `Correction.impliedAttachHost` widened to cover them), Light
 * at the End's missing artwork (2 lines) and Sand Clone's X ATK (1 line).
