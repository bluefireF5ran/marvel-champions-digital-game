/**
 * SP//dr (Peni Parker) Hero Pack curation. Evidence abbreviations:
 * - "raw": the pack's own cached raw record (`packages/content/raw/marvelcdb/spdr.json`).
 * - "insert": the SP//dr Hero Pack insert, `https://hallofheroeslcg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/z2.jpg`, "New
 *   Rule: Separated Identity Card" (fetched 2026-09-19, viewed directly, not stored — CLAUDE.md "Content & IP
 *   boundaries").
 * - "gallery": Hall of Heroes' SP//dr release page (https://hallofheroeslcg.com/peni-parker-sp-dr/) own card scan
 *   gallery, `https://hallofheroeslcg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/<file>.jpg` (fetched 2026-09-19, viewed
 *   directly, not stored).
 *
 * **Separated identity, schema pass §6.10 (docs/phase7-wave2.md).** SP//dr's identity is split across two
 * physical cards: the SP//dr Suit (ACTIVE hero side `31001a`, linked to its own INACTIVE support side `31001b`)
 * and Peni Parker (alter-ego side, linked to her own SP//dr upgrade side). MarvelCDB's cache has **no record at
 * all** for Peni Parker's card — no `31002` anywhere in `spdr.json`, confirmed by grep — which is why `31001a`'s
 * `linked_card` points at a `support` record instead of an `alter_ego` one (the survey's "hero without a linked
 * alter-ego" / "unhandled type hero" / "hero card in set spdr with no identity" ×11 — every one of those last 11
 * is a hero-kit card whose `aspect: hero:31001a` can't resolve without a real identity for the `spdr` set, so
 * fixing this one card fixes all of them).
 *
 * Found a second source with Peni Parker's own two faces: Hall of Heroes' SP//dr release-page gallery hosts full
 * card scans (not just the rulebook insert) at `.../2022/09/s0a.jpg` (Peni Parker, alter-ego, collector mark
 * "2A") and `.../2022/09/s2.jpg` (the SP//dr upgrade side, collector mark "SP//DR (2/17)", "2B"). Both viewed
 * directly and transcribed verbatim below — text, traits, hand size, REC, all cross-checked against the printed
 * card image (font, layout, collector mark all present and legible). `31001b`'s own scan (`.../2022/09/s1.jpg`,
 * "SP//DR (1/17)", "1B") independently confirms MarvelCDB's `31001b` record matches the print (both already emit
 * from the real record, not curated) — including that MarvelCDB's `real_text` already reflects the RRG 1.6 errata
 * noted on the raw record (`errata: "Counters and attachments now move to Peni Parker, instead of the reverse.
 * (RRG 1.6)"`): the scan's own text is the *pre-errata* wording ("moving all counters on her ... to this card"),
 * the reverse direction of MarvelCDB's current `real_text` ("moving all counters on this card ... to her"). No
 * `errata` correction is added for `31001b` here since MarvelCDB's cached text is already the current wording and
 * ingestion reads `real_text` as current by design (`normalize.ts`'s header comment) — flagged for whoever adds
 * the pre-errata `printed` text for `31001b` later (not attempted this pass: the physical print itself was never
 * independently re-verified beyond this one gallery scan, and doing it properly needs the errata's own citation,
 * which is out of scope for unblocking this pack).
 *
 * No corrections/errata beyond the above; the rest of the pack (35 other cards) normalizes cleanly once the
 * identity resolves.
 *
 * **Precon (docs/phase7-wave5.md §1.9, §5; docs/phase7-wave5-sources.md §5):** transcribed 2026-09-26 from the
 * pack's own printed decklist card, "SP//dr Deck", https://hallofheroeslcg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/z1.jpg
 * (fetched via `scripts/fetch_card_art.py grab`, viewed directly, not stored — CLAUDE.md "Content & IP
 * boundaries"). The list's own "1B SP//dr Suit" and "2B SP//dr" lines are the separated identity's two other-side
 * faces (`31001b` and the synthetic `31002b`), already part of the single `HeroIdentityCard` record for `31001a`
 * (`separatedIdentity`) — they are not separate pool cards and are excluded from `cards` the same way the
 * identity's own hero/alter-ego faces are. `identityCode` is `31001a` (SP//dr Suit, ACTIVE side). Every remaining
 * card code and quantity cross-checked against `raw/marvelcdb/spdr.json`'s own `quantity`/`deck_limit` fields (all
 * 11 hero-kit cards at full printed quantity); no second source found for this pack's precon as of this pass.
