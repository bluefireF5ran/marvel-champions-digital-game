/**
 * The Rise of Red Skull curation. Evidence abbreviations:
 * - "raw": the pack's own cached raw record (`packages/content/raw/marvelcdb/trors.json`).
 * - "phase7 wave2 §N": docs/phase7-wave2.md section N, which researched this pack's rulebook and RRG errata.
 * - "RRG errata p.66": `mc_rulesreference_v18_compressed.pdf`'s printed errata page, cited there.
 * - "rulebook p.18": the Red Skull rulebook's spoiler edition
 *   (https://hallofheroeslcg.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rorsrulesspoilers.pdf, linked from
 *   https://hallofheroeslcg.com/the-rise-of-red-skull/), printed page 18, "Starter Decks" — viewed as a page
 *   image and transcribed here (the spoiler-free rulebook the rest of this file cites has only 12 pages and does
 *   not include this section).
 *
 * **Five `ScenarioCuration` entries** (docs/phase7-wave2.md §2.2's own per-scenario table, each cell cited below):
 * villain/main scheme/modular sets, standard I–II / expert II–III (every rulebook page reads "Remove [villain]
 * (I) and add [villain] (III) for expert mode"). "Legions of Hydra" (Crossbones' third modular set) is a *Core*
 * Set encounter set (`packages/content/raw/marvelcdb/core.json`'s `legions_of_hydra`, not present in trors.json
 * at all) — Attack on Mount Athena's 1A just calls for it alongside two of trors' own sets, the same way a
 * scenario can already reference a Core set by code (`normalize/scenarios.ts`'s `CORE_ENCOUNTER_SET_CODES`
 * fallback, built for exactly this). Not a data gap: `core/encounterSets.ts` already registers it.
 *
 * **Starter decks curated from the rulebook's own "Starter Decks" page** (rulebook p.18), transcribed
 * item-by-item and cross-checked against raw (trors.json) by name, code and quantity — every item matched
 * exactly. Spider-Woman's needs two aspects (Aggression + Justice) per her Double-Agent ability (FAQ, RRG 1.8
 * p. 60, docs/phase7-wave2.md §1.2); her "Spider-Woman cards" section on the rulebook page mixes plain hero-kit
 * cards (Captain Marvel, Finesse, Jessica Drew's Apartment, Self-Propelled Glide) with her four aspect-printed
 * signature cards (Venom Blast/Pheromones/Contaminant Immunity/Inconspicuous), all identity-specific
 * (`aspect: hero:04031a`) regardless of their printed aspect color.
