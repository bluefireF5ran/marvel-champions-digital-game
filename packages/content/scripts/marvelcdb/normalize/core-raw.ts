/**
 * Cross-pack artwork by `"<type_code> <name>"`, for a reprint that carries no image of its own (see `reprintImages`
 * in art.ts) — a card reprinted verbatim in a later pack (the "basic"/pool cards — Energy, Genius, Strength,
 * Avengers Mansion, Helicarrier — a hero pack re-listing a Core ally/event/resource under its own MarvelCDB code
 * such as `cap`'s Hawkeye (03012), or a later cycle reprinting a wave 1 card such as `trors`' Avengers Tower
 * (04021, `duplicate_of_code: "03024"`, first printed in `cap`) — gets no `imagesrc` of its own on MarvelCDB: the
 * physical card was never re-photographed, since it is the same printing. Rather than fail ingestion on "no
 * artwork reference", such a card's art resolves to its *first* printing's, matched by exact printed name and
 * MarvelCDB type_code (which is how MarvelCDB itself groups reprints — its own `duplicated_by` field is
 * unreliable/empty for these records, verified against the raw caches).
 *
 * Built once, at import time, from every raw pack cache under `raw/marvelcdb/`, in `PRIORITY_ORDER` (Core, then
 * each wave 1 pack in its release order) followed by every other cached pack in whatever order `readdirSync`
 * returns them — a name+type pair is only ever recorded from the *first* pack that supplies it (`??=`-style: an
 * existing entry is never overwritten), so a pack later in the scan can never shadow an earlier "first printing".
 * `PRIORITY_ORDER` only needs to be correct where two different real printings of the same name+type both carry
 * art of their own (a true redesign, not a reprint) — every wave 1/wave 2 case checked so far is a reprint with no
 * art of its own, so this has not come up, but a future cycle should extend `PRIORITY_ORDER` if it does.

 * `expert` card_set_code at all, confirmed against `raw/marvelcdb/gob.json` — the physical Scenario Pack does not
 * reprint those cards). A scenario naming one of these codes is referencing Core's already-emitted `EncounterSet`
 * record (same `EncounterSetId`), not asking this pack to define a new one — verified against Core's actual raw
 * card_set_code values, not a blind allowlist, so a genuine typo still fails the normal per-pack check.
 *
 * Deliberately Core-only (unlike `CORE_ART_BY_NAME` above): widening this to every pack would change what counts
