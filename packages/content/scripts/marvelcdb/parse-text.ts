/**
 * Splits normalized card text into the structured pieces the schema wants:
 * keywords, play restrictions, attachment host rules, and one entry per
 * printed ability (which becomes an `AbilityReference`).
 *
 * The parser never encodes behavior — it only decides *where abilities are*
 * and gives each a stable id. Anything it can't classify is reported in
 * `unclassified` and the ingest run fails, so new wording in a future pack is
 * surfaced instead of silently dropped.
 *
 * Ability id convention (`<cardCode>.<slug>`, stable — never renumber):
 * - Printed ability name → slug of the name: `01001a.spider-sense`.
 * - Structural encounter/scenario timings → bare slug: `setup`, `boost`,
 *   `preparation`, `when-revealed`, `when-revealed-hero`, `when-revealed-alter-ego`,
 *   `when-defeated`, `obligation` (the whole obligation text).
 * - Everything else → `<card-name-slug>-<kind>`, kind ∈ action | resource |
 *   response | interrupt | forced-response | forced-interrupt | special |
 *   constant: `01008.web-shooter-resource`, `01099.charge-forced-interrupt`.
 *   If two abilities on one card would collide, the form qualifier printed on
 *   the trigger is added (`01018.energy-channel-hero-action`), then a numeric
 *   suffix (`-2`) as a last resort.
 * - Keyword lines (`Guard.`, `Toughness.`), reminder text in parentheses,
 *   restrictions (`Max 1 per player.`), attachment rules (`Attach to a
 *   minion.`), a main scheme's `Contents:` paragraph and the stage-completion
 *   reminder "If this stage/scheme is completed, the players lose the game."
 *   are data or rules reminders, not abilities: the reminder instead sets
 *   `ParsedText.completionLoses` (docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.37,
 *   `MainSchemeStage.completionLoses`), whether or not the stage is final.
 * - A leading `[star]` marker is a printed reminder icon, not part of the
 *   ability kind; it stays in the card text.

/**
 * Wave 1 attachment host phrasing (docs/phase7-wave1.md §1.6, extended for wave 2 — docs/phase7-wave2-data.md
 * §"attachment hosts"). `villainNames.size > 1` means several villains are in play at once (The Wrecking Crew),
 * so a named villain becomes `namedVillain` rather than the single-villain `villain` kind ("Attach to Green
 * Goblin." stays `villain` when there is only one villain — Green Goblin insert's Hysteria).
 *
 * Every branch below resolves to a host kind the schema already has (`AttachmentHost`, `HostQualifiers`,
 * `SuperlativeHostPool`/`HostMeasure`) — nothing here is a new shape. A sentence with a *trailing behavioral
 * clause* on the same sentence ("...and give it a tough status card.", "...and exhaust it.") is deliberately left
 * unresolved: the clause is a card effect, not part of the host, and this parser only ever decides *where
 * abilities are* (file header) — it must not fabricate a host that drops half a printed sentence. Likewise a
 * *conditional/fallback* host ("Attach to X, if able. If you cannot, attach to Y.", "...Otherwise, attach to the
 * villain.") is left unresolved rather than resolved to just the primary target: `AttachmentHost` has no
 * "try this, else that" shape, so silently keeping only the primary would make the card work only part of the
 * time it should. `parseCardText` reports both sentences of a detected fallback pair explicitly (see below) so
 * this doesn't read as ordinary unclassified text.
 */
/**
 * A behavioral clause that follows an attach host on the same sentence ("Attach to Apocalypse and heal 5[per_hero]
 * damage from him.", "Attach to Iron Man and give him a tough status card."): " and " plus a lowercase verb. A host
 * name is capitalized ("Hammer and Anvil" has no lowercase verb after "and"), so only a clause matches.
