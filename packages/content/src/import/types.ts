/**
 * Shared shapes for turning untrusted decklist data (a MarvelCDB API response,
 * or text a player pasted) into a `DeckContents`.
 *
 * This module answers one question — "what does this data name?" — and
 * deliberately does not answer "is this a legal deck?" (`validateDeck` in
 * `@mc/engine`) or "can this build play it?" (`unscriptedCards`). Those stay
 * rules questions, answered after import succeeds, by the engine.
 *
 * What import *does* own: a decklist is untrusted data, not instructions. A
 * malformed shape, a quantity that isn't a small positive integer, a card
 * code/name that doesn't resolve, an identity that isn't a hero identity, or
 * an absent aspect are all reported here, specifically and all at once —
 * never silently dropped into a half-built deck.
