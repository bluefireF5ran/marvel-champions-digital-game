/**
 * Printed play restrictions, as data the engine enforces when a card is played:
 * - `maxPerPlayer`: "Max 1 per player" (in play under one player's control).
 * - `maxPerHost`: "Max 1 per enemy" / "Max 1 per ally" / "Max 1 per scheme" (copies attached to one host).
 * - `form`: "Hero form only" / "Alter-Ego form only" — the player's form when playing it.
 * - `anyPlayerControl`: "Play under any player's control".
 * - `maxPerRound`: "Max 1 per round." (Avengers Assemble!). RRG 1.8 "Max, Maximum": "'Max X per [period]'
 *   imposes a maximum number of times that copies of that card can be played during the designated time period",
 *   counted "across all copies of a card (by title) for all players", and "If a card with a maximum is canceled,
 *   the card is still counted toward the maximum."
 * - `requiresIdentityTrait`: "Play only if your identity has the Avenger trait." (Honorary Avenger, Quincarrier,
 *   Inspiring Presence) and "Play only if you have the Mystic trait." (The Sorcerer Supreme; RRG 1.8 "You, Your":
 *   "you" resolves to your identity). Printed or gained traits both count (RRG 1.8 "Gains").
 * - `requiresControlledCharacterTrait`: "Play only if you control a Spy character." (Spycraft, Espionage). Your
 *   identity is a character you control.
 *
 * - `maxPerPhase`: "Max 1 per phase." (Maximum Velocity, wave 2). The same RRG 1.8 "Max, Maximum" rule (p. 28) with
 *   the phase as the period.
 * - `maxWithTrait`: a maximum counted over cards with a trait rather than copies by title (docs/phase7-wave6.md
 *   §3.28). `per: "host"` is "Max 1 TRAINING upgrade per ally." (Danger Room Training 33015, Mission Training 34016,
 *   Protective Training 32013, Attack Training 32043): the card cannot attach to a host that already has `max`
 *   attachments with the trait. `per: "player"` is "Max 1 TEAM card per player." (Uncanny X-Men 36018, Flight Squadron
 *   53020): the card cannot be played under a player who already controls `max` cards in play with the trait. Printed
 *   or gained traits both count (RRG 1.8 "Gains"), the card itself is never counted against itself, and a put-into-play
 *   obeys it too (RRG 1.8 "Max, Maximum", p. 28).
 *
 * "Play only if you are in [Giant] hero form." (Giant Stomp, Hive Mind) needs no field of its own: it is
 * `form: "hero"` plus `requiresIdentityTrait: GIANT` (or TINY), because the trait is printed on that hero face only
 * (docs/phase7-wave2.md §1.3).
 *
 * The Phase 7 fields are data only until the engine enforces them (docs/phase7-wave1.md §3.10). A card carrying one
 * must not be marked playable before then; `maxPerPhase` is data only (docs/phase7-wave2.md §3).
