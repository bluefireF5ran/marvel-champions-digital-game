/**
 * Player-facing glossary for the Pause & Rules screen (`docs/phase4-screen-gaps.md`
 * §3 W4 "S6", §4 "Keyword glossary wording"). Every definition below is an original
 * paraphrase written for this repo, not a transcription of the RRG's own text — FFG's
 * wording is copyrighted, and §4 settles on "short paraphrase + cite" rather than
 * reproducing the Rules Reference Guide's entries verbatim.
 *
 * Sourcing:
 * - `{ kind: "rrg", page }` cites a real page of `mc_rulesreference_v18_compressed.pdf`
 *   (71 pages total) that this repo actually read for this entry — see the module's own
 *   ingestion notes in git history for how each page was located (the RRG's own two-page
 *   INDEX on pp. 2-3 gives every glossary term's page).
 * - `{ kind: "ruling", date }` cites a dated heading in `marvel-champions-rulings-post-rrg-1-7.md`
 *   (e.g. `"February 28, 2026 - Ruling 4"`, matching that file's own `###` heading text
 *   verbatim so it's directly greppable) whose answer clarifies this keyword/status in a way
 *   that applies generally, not just to the one card the question happened to be about.
 * - `{ kind: "insert-not-in-repo", product }` is for a keyword the schema enumerates that
 *   has no RRG entry at all because it comes from a later product this repo doesn't have
 *   (see `keywords.ts`'s own file-header note on "discount"). Entries sourced this way are
 *   `unverified: true` and must not be trusted as confirmed rules.
 *
 * `conflict` is set on the rare entry where a post-1.7 ruling's answer appears to say the
 * opposite of the RRG's own printed wording for that entry (CLAUDE.md: "Where a ruling and
 * the RRG disagree, ... flag the conflict rather than silently picking one"). Right now
 * that's "quickstrike" and "teamwork" — see their entries. Both record which reading the
 * engine builds (the owner's decision of 2026-10-12: the RRG's), so the flag says the sources
 * disagree, not that the behavior is undecided.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does NOT cover, and why:
 * - "exhausted", "ready", and "facedown boost card" are real RRG glossary entries (pp. 19,
 *   36, 47) and are genuinely table-visible, but `@mc/content`'s schema has no enum for
 *   any of them today — they're runtime card/instance state that only `@mc/engine` models
 *   (see `packages/engine/src/state.ts`). Per this task's own scope ("include only ones
 *   that exist in the schema today"), and since `@mc/content` must never depend on
 *   `@mc/engine` (CLAUDE.md's `client → cards → engine → content` dependency direction),
 *   they're left out here. A future glossary for those belongs wherever the client reads
 *   engine-facing status/state enums from, not in `@mc/content`.
 * - "villainStages"/card-type enums (Hero, Ally, Event, ...) are not "rules terms" a Pause
 *   screen glossary would list next to keywords/statuses; out of scope.
 *
 * Guided mode's G3a (`docs/guided-mode.md` §4 "Glossary") adds a third `kind`,
 * `"concept"`: basic rules vocabulary (threat, main scheme, thwart, ...) a first-time
 * player needs before "keyword" is even a meaningful word. Concepts follow the same
 * sourcing/paraphrase rules as keywords/statuses above, but — unlike a keyword — a concept
 * is never printed on a card and never gated on the current table/pool, so
 * `view/rules-reference.ts` always surfaces every one of them regardless of scope.
