/**
 * Keyword enumeration sourced from:
 *   https://hallofheroeslcg.com/marvel-champions-lcg-keyword-list/
 * ("Marvel Champions LCG Keyword and Mechanic List", fetched 2026-09-09),
 * cross-referenced against the per-release pages linked from
 * hallofheroes-llms.txt for introducing set/date. This is a community index,
 * not the RRG — per CLAUDE.md, treat it as a pointer; the RRG/FAQ text is
 * authoritative if the engine team finds a discrepancy once these keywords
 * get real rules semantics.
 *
 * Coverage as of the fetched page: Core Set (Guard, Overkill, Peril,
 * Quickstrike, Restricted, Retaliate X, Surge, Toughness, Uses (X "type")),
 * The Rise of Red Skull (Incite X, Permanent, Piercing, Ranged, Setup), The
 * Once and Future Kang (Villainous), Ant-Man (Team-Up), Galaxy's Most Wanted
 * (Amplify, Hinder X, Patrol, Stalwart, Victory X), War Machine (Alliance),
 * The Hood (Steady), Sinister Motives (Requirement), Cyclops (Temporary),
 * Mutant Genesis (Teamwork), NeXt Evolution (Assault; Player Side Scheme is a
 * card type, not a keyword), Age of Apocalypse (Find), Agents of SHIELD
 * (Vulnerable).
 *
 * NOT on the keyword-list page as of this fetch: "Discount", "Prerequisite" and "Starting" (all introduced in Fear No
 * Evil). Their definitions come from the Fear No Evil rulebook (fetched 2026-09-18, not stored in the repo), p. 3
 * "Featured Keywords"; see the shapes below. RRG 1.8 has no entry for any of the three, so each glossary entry is
 * `insert-not-in-repo` and `unverified` (docs/phase7-wave2.md §6.11, §7.5).
 *
 * Checked against RRG 1.8 (Jul 2026) for Phase 7 wave 1 (docs/phase7-wave1.md §1):
 * - Glossary entries exist for "Team-Up" (p. 43), "Teamwork (Trait)" (p. 43),
 *   "Requirement (Resources)" (p. 37) and "Linked (Card Title)" (p. 27).
 * - RRG 1.8 has no "Discount" entry at all.
 * - "Find" (p. 19) is defined as an instruction ("When instructed to find a
 *   card, a player searches each game area..."), not a keyword with a value, so
 *   the `find` shape below is unconfirmed.
 * - "Requirement (Resources)" reads "cannot be played unless each resource of
 *   the specified type is spent". Printed cards name up to three icons, so the
 *   shape counts icons (wave 2, docs/phase7-wave2.md §6.1).
 * - No wave 1 card prints Team-Up, Teamwork, Requirement, Find or Discount. The
 *   Thor Hero Pack's "Teamwork" (06032) is an event's title, not the keyword.
 *
 * Checked for Phase 7 wave 2, cycle 1 (docs/phase7-wave2.md §1.8): cycle 1 prints Incite X, Permanent, Piercing,
 * Ranged, Setup, Villainous and Team-Up, plus Core keywords. No shape here changes. Team-Up's two names are the
 * printed "Team-Up (Ant-Man and Wasp)." / "Team-Up (Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch)." (12020, 13020, 14018, 15018).
 * Its play half ("cannot be played unless both of the named friendly characters (identity or ally) are in play",
 * RRG 1.8 "Team-Up", p. 43) is not enforced by the engine yet.
