 * current enemy attack if it has none (no DEF reduction, no exhaust).
 *
 * An "(attack)" ability is one attack (RRG 1.8 "Attack (Player Ability Type)", p. 10; owner ruling, 2026-10-07,
 * docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 Q47): once its `attack` effect, made by the controller's identity, has dealt its damage,

 * enemy attacked once), and the attack finishes after the ability's last effect: retaliate from each attacked enemy
 * still in play, "after … attacks", "at the end of this attack" (`resolve/attack-ability.ts`). Damage the ability
 * deals to anything that is not an enemy stays plain damage.
 *
 * A "(thwart)" ability is a real thwart whether or not it uses the hero's THW (owner decision, 2026-10-03): threat it
 * removes from a scheme, by `removeThreat`, `divide` or `modifyAttack.removesThreat` / `removesThreatFrom` as well as
 * by `thwart`, is a `thwart` event by the controller's identity (`EffectContext.thwartLabeled`). So patrol and
 * `cannotThwart` stop it on the main scheme (RRG 1.8 "Patrol", p. 32), a scheme that player cannot thwart is no target
 * for it ("Target", p. 43), `modifyThwart` adds to each of its removals and "after you thwart" answers it. An
 * unlabeled "remove N threat" stays a plain removal.
 *
 * A "(thwart)" ability whose threat removal names no scheme its player can thwart cannot be initiated, whatever else
 * it does (owner decision, 2026-10-03; `thwartNamesNoValidScheme` in `resolve/target-validity.ts`): "remove 3 threat
 * from the main scheme. If …, return this card to your hand" is not playable under an engaged patrol minion or a
 * crisis icon. With a choice of schemes only the ones that player can thwart are offered. A scheme that becomes
 * unthwartable as the ability resolves is not thwarted: no `thwart` event of amount 0 is raised for it
 * (`thwartBlockedOn`).
 *

 *   [aspect] card"): read from the hand card being **spent**; multiplies what that card generates when the card paid
 *   for matches the query (the card whose cost is paid, per the RRG 1.8 FAQ entry for Make the Call).
 * - `forThisCard` (Lightspeed Flight, `nova` 28004: "Double the number of [wild] resources generated while paying for

   * docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.68): it cannot take damage unless the damage's source card matches. That card is the one
   * the damage came through, else its source (§4 Q39, `damageSourceCard`): the event, support or upgrade whose ability
   * dealt it, an ally for its attack, the identity for a hero's basic attack; resources spent to pay never count. With
   * both fields, damage is blocked when it matches `fromSource` and not `exceptFromSource`.
   *
   * "The villain cannot take damage unless the attacker or attack has the [AERIAL] trait, or the attack has ranged."
   * (docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.30). Three exceptions that only an attack's damage can meet, each read from the attack
   * the damage belongs to (`DamageAttackInfo`); the damage gets through when any exception given holds:
   *
   * - `exceptAttacker`: the attacking character matches (the hero or ally whose attack it is, whatever card made the
   *   attack; an enemy for an enemy's attack).
   * - `exceptAttackCard`: "the attack has the trait" — the card whose ability makes the attack matches (an attack
   *   event, an upgrade's or support's attack ability). A basic attack has no such card: it is the character's own,
   *   which `exceptAttacker` reads. The RRG defines no traits for an attack itself; a trait is a card's (RRG 1.8
   *   "Traits", p. 45), so the attack's are those of the card that creates it.
   * - `exceptAttackKeyword`: the attack has the keyword, its attacker's own or granted to this attack
   *   (`attackKeywordsOf`).
   *
   * Damage that is not from an attack (an ability's or non-attack event's, retaliate, indirect damage) has neither
   * an attacker nor an attack, meets none of them and is blocked (§4.1 Q17). Overkill's spill is "damage from an
   * attack" (RRG 1.8 "Overkill", p. 31) and carries its attack's attacker, card and keywords.

   * "Labeled Ability", p. 26: a thwart "made by that player's identity", whichever card the label is on), else the
   * character the removing card acts for (`actingCharacterOf`, `select.ts`; RRG 1.8 "You, Your", p. 49). A removal no

   * card's speaker): that character's basic thwart, and a "(thwart)"-labeled ability or event, which is a thwart made
   * by its player's identity whichever card the label is on (RRG 1.8 "Labeled Ability", p. 26). Not let through: an
   * unlabeled removal, on that character's own card or event included; another character's thwart (an ally's, another
   * player's identity's); an encounter card's removal; threat moved off the scheme. The scheme is not a legal target

/**
 * A cost paid with cards in play (`AbilityCost.exhaustCards` / `readyCards` / `returnToHand` / `discardCards` /

 *
 * - **Who pays.** Only cards in play that the paying player controls and that match `query` are candidates (RRG 1.8
 *   "Cost", p. 14: "that player must pay costs with cards and/or game elements they control"; ruling June 25, 2026
 *   #1: Steve Rogers can't pay Shield Toss with a Shield Falcon controls). An exhaust candidate must be ready, a
 *   ready candidate exhausted and able to ready. A return candidate must be able to leave play (RRG "Cannot", p. 11).
 * - **How many.** `min`–`max` cards; `max` omitted means no cap. "Any number" and "up to N" still mean at least one
 *   (RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 14), so `min` is at least 1 (`@mc/cards`' validator enforces it).
 * - **Picking.** The picks come from `costChoices[slot]`. With no picks given, the cost pays itself only when the
 *   choice is forced: exactly `min` candidates exist, so every legal payment takes all of them (a unique Shield).
 *   Otherwise the command must name its picks. The cards are bound to `slot`, their count to var `bind`.
 * - **Payable.** With fewer than `min` candidates the cost can't be paid, so the ability can't be initiated and
 *   `legalActions` doesn't offer it (RRG 1.8 "Initiating Abilities", p. 24, steps 3 and 5).
 * - **All at once.** A card can pay only one component of a cost: it can't be exhausted twice, both exhausted and
 *   returned, or also exhausted for a resource in the same payment (RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 13: multiple costs "must be
 *   paid simultaneously").
