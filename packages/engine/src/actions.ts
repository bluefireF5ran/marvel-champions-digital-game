 *
 * - RRG 1.8 "Cost" (p. 13): resources come "by discarding cards from their hand or by using 'Resource' card
 *   abilities". A resource ability is not a card discarded to pay, whatever card carries it: only `fromHand` entries
 *   are counted. "Resource Card" (p. 37) is a card type, so the card's type is what is read, not what it generates.
 * - §4.1 Q28 = A: overpaid resources "were not paid for that cost" (p. 13), so a card whose every resource is
 *   overpaid is left out, and at a cost of 0 nothing was paid (FAQ "Unstoppable Force (#6)", p. 60). The rules do not
 *   say which resources are the overpaid ones: a card counts when some reading of the payment has one of its resources
 *   paid, which is the reading its player would give.
 *   Each card is judged on its own, so in an overpaid payment the var can count more cards than one reading of the
 *   payment holds together (two resource cards toward a cost of 1 count 2): it is exact as "at least one", which is
 *   all a card in the pool asks, and an upper bound as a number.
 * - "Spend X resources" (`resourcesX`): the X resources are paid too, so they join the requirement here.
 *
 * The cards themselves are `cardsThatPaid`, read before paying, while the cards are still in hand; a play binds them as
 * slot `paid.cards` (`PAID_CARDS_SLOT`). The vars travel with the other `paid.*` vars (`playPaymentVars`).

 * (the play command, `legalActions`, the payment preview, a play an effect makes), each reading the same board, so the

 * - **Read, and declared on the command:** the paid resources are the `paidRequirement` resources that give the most
 *   declared types (`paidAsDeclared`), recorded as `paid.as.<type>`.
 * - **Read, not declared:** the player is asked, except in the one case the owner allowed: every legal declaration

 *   the overpaid ones, RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 13): when the sets read differently to a reader, the player says which was
 *   paid (`choosePaidResources`, asked by the frame paid for, after any wild declaration); when they all read the
 *   same, the first is taken and nobody is asked. So "every legal declaration reads the same" above compares what
