/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.3 and §4.1 Q3: the assault keyword.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Assault" (p. 8): "When a character makes a basic thwart against a scheme with the assault keyword, that
 * character uses its ATK instead of its THW.
 * - The assault keyword is equivalent to the following constant ability: 'While a character is making a basic thwart
 *   against this scheme, that character uses its ATK instead of its THW.'
 * - If the thwarting character is an ally, it takes the consequential damage listed under its ATK instead of its THW
 *   after the thwart.
 * - Abilities that increase a character's 'basic power' can be used to increase that character's ATK when that
 *   character thwarts a scheme with assault."
 *
 * §4.1 Q3 (owner decision): a divided basic thwart is one basic thwart, so one that includes any scheme with assault
 * uses ATK for the whole thwart (its shares total ATK), and an ally making it takes its ATK consequential damage.
 *
 * Synthetic cards. The hero has ATK 3, THW 2. The sidekick ally has ATK 4 with 2 consequential damage under it and
 * THW 2 with 1 under it; the careful ally has 0 under its ATK and 3 under its THW. Every scheme starts at 9 threat
 * (the main scheme at 10): an encounter side scheme and a player side scheme with assault, and one of each without.
