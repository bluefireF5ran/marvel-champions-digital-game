/**
 * docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.49: a player upgrade attached to any character, by an effect (`attach`, `findCard`'s
 * `{ attachTo }`) or as a cost (`AbilityCost.attach`, `AbilityCost.dealDamage`), proven with a synthetic "charm" upgrade
 * shaped like Rogue's Touched (`rogue` 38002): Skin Contact (38001a, "Find Touched and attach it to another character")
 * and Energy Transfer (38007, "Hero Action: Find Touched and attach it to a character other than Rogue and deal 2 damage
 * to that character → heal 2 damage from Rogue and ready her"; both erratum RRG 1.8 p. 69).
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Attach To" (p. 8: placed on a game element in play; discarded when that element leaves play; the
 * card's own "attach to" text is not resolved when an ability attaches it to a specific game element). "Ownership and
 * Control" (p. 31: cards enter play under their owner's control; control stays constant; a card leaving play goes to
 * its owner's out-of-play area). "Cost" (pp. 13–14: paid in full; with cards the payer controls or from their own
 * out-of-play areas; "If dealing damage is a cost, that cost is considered paid even if some or all of that damage is
 * prevented"). "Find" (p. 19), "Search" (p. 39). §4 Q30 (default, §4.1): another player's hero or alter-ego, any ally,
 * any minion and the villain are all hosts.
 *
 * Control of an attached upgrade (owner decision 2026-10-03), RRG 1.8 "Ownership and Control" (p. 31): "Upgrades
 * attached to a card controlled by a player other than the upgrade's owner are controlled by that other player."
 * "Upgrades on a card that changes control also change control to the same new controller." "A player controls the
 * cards in their own out-of-play areas." On an enemy or the villain (the scenario's, not a player's) it stays its
 * owner's. Its abilities are its controller's: "you" is the host's controller, and "Rogue" is its owner's identity
 * (`identityOf(ownerOf(self))`).
 *
 * Synthetic cards only; the engine never names a card.
