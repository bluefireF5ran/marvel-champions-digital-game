/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.35: `AbilityDefinition.attachInstruction`, an attachment's "attach to" text when the host
 * depends on a condition ("If [a named card] is in play, attach to [one character]. Otherwise, attach to your
 * identity."). It resolves at the reveal's attach step (RRG 1.8 "Reveal", p. 38, step 2), before the card's When
 * Revealed abilities; a cancel of the card's "When Revealed" effects does not stop it, a cancel of all its effects
 * does (RRG 1.8 "Cancel", p. 13), and a card it leaves unattached is handled as an attachment with no legal data host
 * is (RRG 1.8 "Attach To", p. 8). Proven with synthetic cards.
