/**
 * docs/phase7-wave5.md §3.30: a player card attached to an encounter card and returned when its host leaves. Synthetic
 * cards shaped like Wrist Navigator (`sm` 27189a, campaign: "Setup. Permanent. Forced Response: After a minion or side
 * scheme enters play, attach Wrist Navigator to it. Interrupt: When the attached card is defeated, draw 1 card. (Return
 * this card to your play area.)").
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Attach To" (p. 8: the attached card is discarded when its host leaves play), "Permanent" (p. 32: it
 * cannot leave play except by card abilities in its own set; stranded with no "attach to" target, it is removed from
 * the game, unless, as here, its own text returns it when the host is defeated: `staysWhenHostLeaves`), "Ownership and Control" (p. 31: control stays constant;
 * an encounter card is controlled by the scenario, not a player, so the upgrade's owner keeps it).
