/**
 * One "(attack)" ability is one attack (`resolve/attack-ability.ts`). Owner ruling, 2026-10-07, docs/phase7-wave8.md
 * §4.1 Q47, following FFG's ruling on the Cyclops ally (Q46: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 becomes 3 + 3 + 3 + 3):
 *
 *   An event or ability with the (attack) label is one attack. Damage it deals to enemies while resolving is damage
 *   from that attack, even when separate instructions deal it or it goes to different enemies. Kept distinct:
 *   1. retaliate triggers once per surviving enemy attacked, not once per instance of damage;
 *   2. "after this attack" effects resolve after the whole ability, its further damage included;
 *   3. several instances against one enemy each take the modifiers that apply;
 *   4. damage the ability deals to the attacking identity is not attack damage dealt to an enemy.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Attack (Player Ability Type)" (p. 10): "An ability labeled as an attack is considered a single attack, even
 * if that attack deals multiple instances of damage"; "When an attack targets multiple enemies, the attacking character
 * is considered to have attacked each of those enemies. Each attacked enemy with the retaliate X keyword that is still
 * in play after the attack resolves deals its retaliate damage to the attacking character"; step 7, forced abilities
 * (retaliate) with "after [character] attacks …" and "after [character] is attacked …", then step 8.
 *
 * Synthetic cards only: every event costs 0 and the hero is the default test hero (10 hit points, ATK 2).
