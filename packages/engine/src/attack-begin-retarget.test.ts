/**
 * Full QA, piece 10a (docs/phase7-wave8-full-qa.md, "Defects found"): the attack-begin machinery of
 * `resolve/attack-ability.ts` (docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 rows 61, 65, 73) against a target changed in the attack's
 * "when you attack" window (`EffectSpec retargetAttack`, docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.66), a moved-damage attack that is
 * never made, the attack in progress while an "(attack)" ability's attack finishes, and the log of a begun attack.
 *
 * Official text: RRG 1.8 "Attack (Player Ability Type)" (p. 10: "resolving that ability is considered to attack the
 * specified target", "An ability labeled as an attack is considered a single attack"), "Labeled Ability" (p. 26),
 * "Retaliate X" (p. 38), "Guard" (p. 21), "Cancel" (p. 11), "Move" and "Heal" (p. 22). What a changed target means
 * for damage dealt by an instruction that resolves after the window is this engine's interpretation, stated in
 * `attack-ability.ts` ("A target changed in the attack's window").
