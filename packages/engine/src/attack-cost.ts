/**
 * "As an additional cost to attack [an enemy], you must discard 1 card from your hand." (`RuleSpec
 * additionalAttackCost`, docs/phase7-wave10-hero-packs.md H3.16): a cost a rule adds to every attack a player makes
 * against a matching enemy. Whether it can be paid, when it is charged, and how it is paid.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Cost" (p. 14): "Some card abilities may reference an 'additional cost.' A player must pay all additional
 * costs simultaneously with the cost that is being added to … if they cannot pay for all of the costs at once, then
 * they do not pay any of the costs and the effect associated with the costs does not occur." "Attack (Player Ability
 * Type)" (p. 10): "Hero and ally attacks can target any enemy, unless a card ability … is preventing that enemy from
 * being attacked", and "If a triggered ability is labeled as an attack … resolving that ability is considered to
 * attack the specified target." "Labeled Ability" (p. 26): the attack is made by the player's identity.
 *
 * - **Who pays.** The controller of the attacking character: the player whose hero or ally makes a basic attack, and
 *   the player resolving an "(attack)" ability, whose identity attacks (p. 26). An attack no player makes (one enemy
 *   attacking another) owes nothing.
 * - **An enemy the attacker's controller cannot pay for cannot be attacked** (`attackCostBars`, read by `canAttack`),
 *   as the owner ruled for the additional cost to thwart a scheme (docs/phase7-wave5.md §4.1 Q18): it is no legal
 *   target of a basic attack, is not offered to an "(attack)" ability's choice, and is skipped by an instruction that
 *   names it with others ("each enemy"), exactly as a villain behind a guard minion is. So the character does not
 *   exhaust and no card is spent on an attack that could not be paid for.
 * - **When it is paid: as the attack is made against that enemy, before anything of the attack resolves**
 *   (`chargeAttackCosts`, looked at before every frame the stack runs). A basic attack and an `attack` effect are an
 *   `attack` event: the cost is paid before that event's "when … attacks" window. An "(attack)" ability's damage or
 *   defeat instruction names its enemies as it resolves: the cost is paid before that damage or defeat. The engine asks
 *   an ability's "choose an enemy" as it resolves, after the card's own costs, so "simultaneously" (p. 14) is read as
 *   "with nothing in between": the hand that pays is the hand left once the card's own costs are paid, which is the
 *   hand a simultaneous payment would have had to find both costs in. See the report with HT13 for the alternative.
 * - **Once per attack per enemy.** An "(attack)" ability is one attack however many instances of damage it deals
 *   (p. 10), so an enemy two of its instructions name is paid for once (`attackCostsCharged` on the attack's event
 *   frames, shared by the events of one ability). A second attack pays again.
 * - **Mandatory once the enemy is attacked.** The text is "you must": a player who can pay and attacks the enemy pays.
 *   With a choice of enemy the player declines by choosing another; an instruction that names the enemy among others
 *   attacks it whenever it can be paid for.
 * - **A stunned character's basic attack still pays** (`pushAttackCosts` from the command): RRG 1.8 "Stun, Stunned"
 *   (p. 41), "Costs associated with the attack attempt, including exhausting the character, must still be paid", as
 *   the owner ruled for a confused thwart (wave 5 §4.1 Q40). A stunned identity's "(attack)" ability is cancelled as
 *   it is triggered, before it names an enemy, and pays nothing.
 * - **Not charged:** damage that is not an attack on the enemy (an unlabeled ability's damage, an overkill spill,
 *   retaliate, an instruction marked `fromAttack: false`), and an enemy an attack was moved onto in its own window
 *   (`retargetAttack`): the player did not choose to attack it.
 *
 * What the cost may be: any `AbilityCost` that `planCost` checks and `payCost` pays at once without resources: a
 * discard from hand above all. `@mc/cards`' validator refuses the rest.
