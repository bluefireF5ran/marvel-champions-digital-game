/**
 * Three owner rulings of 2026-10-07 on "(attack)" abilities (docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1), built on Q47's rule in
 * `resolve/attack-ability.ts` (whose own fixtures are `attack-ability.test.ts`):
 *
 * - **Q48 = A.** Every ability labeled (attack) is an attack, whether or not it uses the hero's ATK or has an attack
 *   effect. RRG 1.8 "Labeled Ability" (p. 26): "When a player resolves an ability labeled '(attack),' that ability is
 *   considered to be an attack made by that player's identity."
 * - **Q49 = A, qualified.** Guard restricts attack targeting, not damage, and is checked for every enemy the attack
 *   targets at the time that enemy would be attacked. RRG 1.8 "Guard" (p. 21); "Attack (Player Ability Type)" (p. 10):
 *   "Hero and ally attacks can target any enemy, unless a card ability (such as guard) is preventing that enemy from
 *   being attacked."
 * - **Q50 = B, multi-target recognized.** Attacked targets are tracked apart from damage recipients. RRG 1.8 p. 10:
 *   "When an attack targets multiple enemies, the attacking character is considered to have attacked each of those
 *   enemies. Each attacked enemy with the retaliate X keyword that is still in play after the attack resolves deals
 *   its retaliate damage to the attacking character."
 *
 * - **Row 61 (rules check A1), owner decision 2026-10-08.** The attack begins as the ability begins resolving, before
 *   its first instruction. RRG 1.8 "Labeled Ability" (p. 26): "The identity of the player using the labeled ability is
 *   considered to be performing the labeled effect when the labeled ability begins resolving (after costs have been
 *   paid)." The engine's readings on top of it (opening target choices first, the target the attack begins with) are
 *   in `resolve/attack-ability.ts`.
 * - **Row 73 (rules check A1, second half), owner decision 2026-10-08.** An ability with an `attack` effect begins
 *   its attack the same way: when another instruction resolves before that effect, the attack and its window open
 *   before that instruction, and the effect deals the damage of the attack already begun. Same sentence of p. 26.
 *   The readings on top of it (what is read ahead, several attacks, a stun received meanwhile) are interpretations,
 *   stated with their alternatives in `resolve/attack-ability.ts`.
 * - **Every "(attack)" ability, contributor's rules call (bluefireF5ran) 2026-10-15** (RRG 1.8 p. 26 as written; FFG
 *   ruling June 26, 2025): the ability is an attack by the identity from when it begins resolving, whether or not it
 *   deals an enemy damage. The tests that pinned "with no damage there is no attack" (rows 61/73, Q48) now expect an
 *   attack on nobody.
 *
 * Synthetic cards only: every event costs 0 and the hero is the default test hero (10 hit points, ATK 2). Every play
 * is replayed from its log and compared (`play`).
