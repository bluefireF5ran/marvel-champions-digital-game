/**
 * `PlayerRef attackedPlayer { attacker?, initiated? }`: the "you" of an enemy's constant "While [this enemy] is
 * attacking you, he gets +X ATK, where X is the number of cards in your hand." A constant has no event and an enemy
 * no controller, so the ref reads the attack in progress on the stack. Synthetic cards only.
 *
 * Sources and the readings pinned here:
 * - RRG 1.8 "Defend, Defense" (p. 16): "If a player defends against an enemy attack that targets a different player
 *   …, the defending player becomes the new target of that attack"; "Any constant or boost abilities that refer to
 *   'you' refer to the defending player." Owner ruling 2026-10-09 (docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 row 93): follow the RRG.
 *   So the bonus reads the hand of the player the attack was initiated against until a defender is declared (step 2,
 *   p. 9), and the defending player's from then on, which is the hand the damage step (step 4) reads. An undefended
 *   attack, or one the attacked player's own character defends, reads the attacked player's.
 * - `initiated: true` names the player the attack was initiated against, whoever defends (p. 8; the "you" of "When
 *   [enemy] attacks you", p. 16).
 * - RRG 1.8 "Attacks Against Allies" (p. 10): "The player who controls the ally is considered the attacked player".
 * - Owner decisions docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1 Q5 = A and Q16 = A: once an effect moves the attack onto another
 *   player's ally (`retargetAttack`), that ally's controller is the attacked player.
