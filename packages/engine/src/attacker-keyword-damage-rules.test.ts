/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.30: damage rules that read who or what is attacking. Synthetic cards shaped like the three
 * printed wordings:
 *
 * 1. "The villain cannot take damage unless the attacker or attack has the [FLY] trait, or the attack has ranged."
 *    (`cannotTakeDamage` with `exceptAttacker`, `exceptAttackCard`, `exceptAttackKeyword`)
 * 2. "Reduce the amount of damage this minion takes from each attack by 1 unless the attacker has the [TINY] trait."
 *    (`reduceDamageTaken` with `fromAttack` and `exceptAttacker`)
 *    and, with all three of the first wording's exceptions, "Reduce the damage each [FLY] character takes from each
 *    attack by 2 unless the attacker or attack has the [FLY] trait, or the attack has ranged." (docs/phase7-wave9.md
 *    §3.25; `exceptAttackCard`, `exceptAttackKeyword` read by the same `attackMeetsException`)
 * 3. "This villain ignores the retaliate keyword while attacking a non-[FLY] character." (`characterIgnores` with
 *    `"retaliate"` and `against`)
 *
 * Sources. §4.1 Q17 = A: damage with no attack behind it (a non-attack event or ability, retaliate, indirect damage)
 * has neither an attacker nor an attack, so the first wording blocks it. "The attack has the trait" is the trait on
 * the card whose ability makes the attack (an attack event, an upgrade's attack ability), as distinct from the
 * attacking character's: the RRG gives an attack no traits of its own, only cards have them (RRG 1.8 "Traits", p. 45).
 * RRG 1.8 "'Cannot'" (p. 11): absolute, so it comes before a tough status card, which replaces damage the character
 * "would take" (RRG 1.8 "Tough", p. 44; "Damage", p. 14, step 2) and is not used; piercing discards none (RRG 1.8
 * "Piercing", p. 32, the engine's reading kept from before ruling January 17, 2026 (3)). RRG 1.8 "Overkill" (p. 31):
 * the spill is "damage from an attack", and excess is measured on damage taken (user decision 2026-09-25, setting
 * aside February 8, 2026 - Ruling 2's "heals 3"). RRG 1.8 "Ranged" (p. 36), "Retaliate X" (p. 38), "Ignore" (p. 23).
 * RRG 1.8 "Target" (p. 43): a character that cannot take the damage is no valid target of a basic attack or of an
 * ability that only deals it damage.
