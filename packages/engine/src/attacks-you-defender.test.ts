/**
 * Who "you" is in "[enemy] attacks you" (`EventPattern.usesAttackedPlayer`), by timing. Synthetic cards only.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Defend, Defense" (the entry begins on p. 15; these sentences are on p. 16): "If a player defends against an
 * enemy attack that targets a different player (either by defending with a character they control or by resolving a
 * defense ability), the defending player becomes the new target of that attack. Any triggered ability that refers to
 * 'you' refers to the player who was the target of the attack when that ability resolved. (For example, the 'you' in
 * an ability that triggers 'when [enemy] attacks you' refers to the player against whom the attack initiated, while
 * the 'you' in an ability that triggers 'after [enemy] attacks you' refers to the player whose character defended the
 * attack.)" Owner ruling 2026-10-09, docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 row 91.
 *
 * - "Defend, Defense" (p. 15): "When an ally defends an attack, that ally becomes the target character for that
 *   attack, and its controller becomes the target player for that attack." So another player's ally defending makes
 *   that ally's controller the "you" of the "after".
 * - "Attack (Enemy Activation)" (p. 8): "Abilities that trigger 'When/After [enemy] attacks you' are resolved
 *   when/after a player is attacked, regardless of which character they control was attacked." A player who defends
 *   with their own ally is still "you".
 * - "Attacks Against Allies" (p. 10): "The player who controls the ally is considered the attacked player."
