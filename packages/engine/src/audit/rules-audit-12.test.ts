/**
 * Rules audit chunk 12 (Glossary: PLAY, PUT INTO PLAY ... PLAYER'S PLAY AREA). Audit proofs only: each `it.fails`

 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Play, Put into Play" (p. 32): "Cards with the text '[type] form only' can only be played or put into play by
 * a player whose identity is in the specified form." `playCard` enforces a printed `playRestrictions.form`
 * (`actions.ts`, `wrong_form`), but the `putIntoPlay` effect (`resolve/apply-effect.ts`) never reads it, so an effect
 * such as Superpower Training's "put it into play" puts a "Hero Form only" upgrade onto an alter-ego.
