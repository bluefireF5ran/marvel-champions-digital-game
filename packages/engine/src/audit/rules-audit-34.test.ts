/**
 * Rules audit chunk 34 (FFG rulings post-RRG 1.6, July 25 - October 10, 2025).
 *
 * Ruling 69.82 (July 25, 2025, Alex), question 2: Hope Summers is a minion engaged with a player (an ally under
 * 'Pool-ized) while Sinister Ends is in play. "Yes, in that case Mister Sinister will attack the Hope Summers minion.
 * As this is still an enemy attack activation, a player can still defend against this attack." RRG 1.8 is silent
 * on a forced interrupt that moves an enemy attack onto a minion (p. 8 "Attack (Enemy Activation)" only names a
 * player's alter-ego or an ally), so the ruling stands.
 *
 * The engine's `retargetAttack` (enemy form, `resolve/apply-effect.ts`) drops any target whose `controllerOf` is
 * null, and an engaged minion has no controller (`engageInPlayMinion` sets `controllerId: null`), so the attack
 * stays on the player's hero.

 * Focused Defense attachment. (Since threat is being 'moved' from one scheme to another, the number of tokens placed
 * should be fixed; and the player should not be able to split the tokens, so this is the simplest way to progress.)"
 * RRG 1.8 p. 30 "Move" is silent on two main schemes; MC21 p. 10 says an encounter card's "the main scheme" is both
 * schemes, which the ruling narrows for this move.
 *
 * The shipped script is `51034.when-defeated` = `whenDefeated(moveThreat(find(Manipulated M.U.S.I.C.), theMainScheme))`
 * (`cards/src/wave9/bp/black-panther/obligation-nemesis.ts`); this is its shape on synthetic cards. The engine's
 * `moveThreat` takes the first of the targets `{ kind: "mainScheme" }` resolves to for an encounter card, which is
 * both main schemes in `sharedMainSchemes` order, not the one holding Focused Defense.
