/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.43 items 2–5, §4.1 Q24: a campaign's player side scheme, end to end. A double-sided card
 * whose front is a player side scheme the players as a group put into play ("Put the chosen player side scheme into
 * play", MC40 rulebook p. 7), so nobody played it and nobody controls it, and whose back is an environment it flips to
 * when defeated ("When Defeated: Flip this card and put [the environment] into play.").
 *
 * Synthetic cards: three such fronts with "4 per player" starting threat, each reading "This scheme does not count
 * against the player side scheme limit."; their environments ("Enters play with 1 supply counter on it. Action: Remove
 * 1 supply counter from here → each player draws 1 card and you take 1 damage. (Any player can do this.)", "Each hero
 * gets +1 DEF.", and one with no text); a fourth front without the limit text; one whose When Defeated removes threat
 * from the main scheme.
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Player Side Scheme" (p. 34: starting threat, "Heroes and allies can remove threat from a player
 * side scheme by performing a basic thwart", defeated with no threat on it), "Player Elimination" (p. 33: only the
 * eliminated player's own cards and the cards in their play area leave), "Flip" (p. 20: a different card type discards
 * tokens; the card stays in play), "Double-Sided Card" (p. 17: removed from the game instead of entering a discard
 * pile), "When Defeated Abilities" (p. 48: the card leaves play after its When Defeated), "Crisis Icon" (p. 14: "by
 * player cards"); MC40 rulebook p. 3 ("All rules that apply to player cards apply to player side schemes").
 *
 * Readings pinned here:
 * - "Put [the environment] into play" is an entry into play and not a reveal: the back's "Enters play with 1 counter"
 *   applies (docs/phase7-wave4.md §4 Q17: a new face is treated as entering play) and nothing is revealed.
 * - An Action on a card nobody controls is offered to the active player, whoever that is ("Any player can do this"),
 *   and "you" in it is the player who used it.
 * - A front with Victory would not reach the victory display: its When Defeated resolves first and turns it into a
 *   card that is not the defeated scheme, so it stays in play. The printed fronts have no Victory keyword.
