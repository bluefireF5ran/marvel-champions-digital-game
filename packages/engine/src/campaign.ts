 * Campaign mode as plain, serializable data.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Modes of Play" (p. 29): "Campaign mode allows players to modify standard mode through interconnected
 * scenarios that are played one after another. **No two campaigns are exactly alike, and the rules for each are
 * found in the campaign's associated rulebook.**" That second sentence is the whole design constraint — the engine
 * cannot know what any one campaign does, so this file declares only the *vocabulary* a rulebook's campaign
 * instructions are written in. No campaign and no card is ever named here: a box is a `CampaignDefinition` value
 * authored in `@mc/cards`, exactly the way card text is, and adding a box must not add a member to any union below.
 *
 * The shapes were surveyed against all ten campaign rulebooks (`docs/campaign-modes/markdown/`, the inventory in
 * `docs/campaign-mode-design.md` §1), not against the first box we build, so each non-obvious member cites the
 * printed sentence that forces it — `MC60 p. 9` means page 9 of the Fear No Evil rulebook conversion.
 *
 * **This module is data only.** The runner (`resolveBetweenGames`, `campaignResultOf`, `applyCampaignResult`) and the
 * campaign `DeckContext` are later steps (design §11 steps 4-5). Nothing here has behavior, and every type is plain
 * JSON — no functions, classes, `Map`, `Set` or `Date` — so a log round-trips through `JSON.stringify`. The in-game
 * primitives (design §11 step 3) are declared where the rest of the executable vocabulary lives — `spec.ts`'s
 * `ValueSpec`/`Predicate`/`CardSelector`/`EffectSpec` — and read the frozen `GameState.campaign` snapshot only.
