/**
 * The between-games interpreter: `CampaignValue`, `CampaignPredicate`, `CampaignChoiceSource` and every
 * `CampaignOp` (design §4.4, §4.5; §11 step 4).
 *
 * Every switch here is exhaustive with no `default:`, deliberately — the requirement the whole foundation is
 * answerable to is that adding a campaign box is content-only, and the only way to know that holds is for a
 * member of the vocabulary that no built box uses to be a *compile* error if it is ever forgotten, rather than a
 * silent no-op discovered when that box ships.
 *
 * No campaign and no card is named. Everything is a pure function of the working log, the definition, the card
 * pool and the recorded answers, so re-running the same step list with the same answers produces the same log —
 * which is what `resolveBetweenGames`'s pending-choice re-entry relies on (`runner.ts`).
