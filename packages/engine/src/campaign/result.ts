/**
 * Reading a finished game back into the campaign (design §7.2, §11 step 4).
 *
 * `campaignResultOf` is a **derived reducer** over the final `GameState` and the event stream, exactly as
 * `client/src/engine/game-record.ts` is over the same two things — never something a client accumulates and hands
 * back, because then the campaign would believe whatever the client said. Everything it reads is already in the
 * replayable record, so replaying a saved game reproduces the same result value.
 *
 * The one thing it does *not* derive is the in-game writes: `recordInCampaignLog` and the in-game
 * `removeFromCampaign` accumulate in `GameState.campaignWrites` as they resolve (`resolve/campaign.ts`), and those
 * are copied through verbatim so a lost game's writes stay distinguishable from between-games writes.
