/**
 * The campaign runner, played end to end headlessly (design §11 step 4).
 *
 * Everything here runs against the **synthetic** campaign in `testing/campaign.ts`: no published box, scenario or
 * card is named, because the whole point of the foundation is that the engine cannot know which campaign it is
 * running. The synthetic box is deliberately the *hard* shape — a branching graph with a finale, a hidden field
 * written by a seeded draw, a `strikeList`, per-seat grants, a `thisGame` grant and a real DEFEAT block — so that
 * the eight linear, free-retry boxes are the easy case rather than the only case.
