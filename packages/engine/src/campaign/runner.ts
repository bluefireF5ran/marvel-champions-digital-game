/**
 * The campaign runner (design §7, §11 step 4): headless, deterministic, and the only thing that ever changes a
 * `CampaignLog`.
 *
 * Four functions make one loop:
 *
 * ```
 * CampaignLog ──resolveBetweenGames──▶ CampaignLog with an `attempt`
 *                                          │  startGameFromLog ──▶ createGame({ …, campaign })
 *                                          │                                   play / save / resume
 *                                          └──────── campaignResultOf ──▶ applyCampaignResult ──▶ CampaignLog'
 * ```
 *
 * **Re-entry is re-running.** A between-games step list that reaches a `choose` with no recorded answer returns
 * that choice as plain data and changes nothing; the caller answers it and calls the same function again with the
 * enlarged answer list, and the whole list runs from the beginning. Nothing partial is ever persisted, so
 * `(log, answers)` is the complete input — which is exactly why a campaign replays from its seed plus the answers
 * its history recorded, and why a client cannot reroll a `random` op by reloading.
 *
 * No campaign and no card is named here. Every rulebook citation is an example of the *shape* being interpreted.

 * it, a side scheme picked for it — is rolled back, which is half of MC40 p. 7's "they must choose the same player
 * side scheme … even if they defeated it during a game they lost"; the other half, not offering the choice again, is
 * `choose.repeatOnRetry` reading this attempt's entry in the history written below.
 *
 * The campaign's RNG is rolled back with the rest, unless the DEFEAT block itself draws (MC50 p. 19 prepares the
 * evidence again). Such a block draws on from the RNG as it stood when the lost game was composed, and the log keeps
 * the RNG where the block left it. Its draws are therefore never the values that made the lost game's seed, and a
 * second loss of the same node starts its block from another state than the first did.
 *
 * Under `retryBaseline: "keepLog"` (MC60 p. 8) nothing is restored: the log, the RNG included, stays as the attempt
 * left it, the game's writes and the DEFEAT block go on top, and a `choice` graph asks for the next node again.
