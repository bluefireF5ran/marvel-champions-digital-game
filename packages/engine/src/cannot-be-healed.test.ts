/**
 * docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.12: "cannot be healed (by player card effects)". Synthetic cards shaped like Protect the
 * Senator (`mut_gen` 32065b: "Robert Kelly cannot be healed by player card effects") and Medical Emergency (32071, an
 * encounter card that heals him).
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "'Cannot'" (p. 11) is absolute; "Heal" (p. 22): moving damage off a character heals it; "Recover"
 * (p. 36). A basic recovery is the identity's own power, so its source is the identity, a player card.
