/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.10, §4.1 Q7: "Card abilities cannot remove this ally from play" is `RuleSpec cannotLeavePlay`
 * with `by: "cardAbilities"`. An effect that moves the card out of play (discard, return to hand or deck, removal from
 * the game, a swap with a card out of play) or says "defeat" does nothing to it when a card's ability resolves it or
 * pays it as a cost. The source is the card whose ability is resolving, as the Permanent keyword's protection reads it
 * (`effects.ts` `permanentStopsLeaving`, docs/phase7-wave5.md §4.1 Q46).
 *
 * The game's own rules have no source card and still remove it. RRG 1.8 "Ally" (p. 7) tells the two apart: an ally
 * "remains in play until a card ability or game effect causes it to leave play. If an ally's remaining hit points are
 * reduced to zero, it is defeated and discarded from play." So damage from any source still defeats it ("Defeat",
 * p. 15), the ally limit's discard still takes it ("Ally Limit", p. 7: the player "must immediately choose and discard
 * from play ally cards they control"; the RRG does not call that a card ability), and so does its controller's
 * elimination ("Player Elimination", p. 34). The unqualified rule stays absolute (RRG 1.8 "'Cannot'", p. 11).
 *
 * Synthetic cards only: a guarded ally, the same with Victory 1, an ally under the unqualified rule and a plain one.
