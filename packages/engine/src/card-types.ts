 *   p. 20), not card types, so they are not listed separately.
 * - `main_scheme` and `villain` are card types like any other, though neither can be in a hand or a deck.
 * - `evidence` (the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. campaign's evidence cards) is `null`: a campaign component the RRG's list
 *   does not name.
