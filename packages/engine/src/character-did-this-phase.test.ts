/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.36 gap 2: a per-phase record of which characters attacked and which thwarted
 * (`GameState.characterActsThisPhase`), and `Predicate characterDidThisPhase` over it. Synthetic cards shaped like
 * "Attach to your identity. Hero Action: If your hero attacked and thwarted this phase → discard this card."
 *
 * - **Which attacks and thwarts** (owner decision §4.1 Q23 = A): any made by the hero, its basic powers and every
 *   ability labeled "(attack)" or "(thwart)" its player resolves (RRG 1.8 "Labeled Ability", p. 26: "that ability is
 *   considered to be an attack/a thwart made by that player's identity"; FAQ "Jarnbjorn (#19)", RRG 1.8 p. 59: "A
 *   hero is considered to make an attack both through their basic attack power and actions with the (attack)
 *   label"). An ally's are the ally's. Unlabeled damage and unlabeled threat removal are neither.
 * - **"This phase"** is read literally: the player phase is one phase holding every player's turn and its end-of-phase
 *   steps (RRG 1.8 "Player Phase", p. 34), so the record outlasts a turn and is emptied only when the phase changes.
 *   What a hero does in the villain phase counts for that villain phase.
 * - **A 0 result** follows what "after you attack" / "after you thwart" hear: an attack into a tough status card was
 *   made; a stunned attack and a confused thwart are canceled (RRG 1.8 "Stunned", p. 41; "Confused", p. 13) and a
 *   thwart patrol or a crisis icon forbids is never made (RRG 1.8 "Patrol", p. 32; "Crisis Icon", p. 14).
