/**
 * An ability that opens with more than one required choice: each of them needs a card to choose, not only the last.
 *
 * - RRG 1.8 "Target" (p. 42): "If an ability or game function requires one or more targets, that ability or game
 *   function can only be initiated if it has at least one valid target."
 * - "Choose (Game Element)" (p. 12): "If a player card ability requires the choosing of one or more targets, and there
 *   are no valid targets for any part of the ability, the ability cannot be initiated."
 * - "'Swap'" (p. 42): "A swap cannot be completed if there is not a component in both locations. For example, you
 *   cannot 'swap a card in your hand with the top card of your deck' if you have no cards in hand."
 * - "Player Deck" (p. 33): an emptied deck is remade from the discard pile at once, so a deck is empty only while the
 *   discard pile is too, and then it has no top card.
 * - "Target" (p. 43): "An ability with a search effect requires only a searchable game area in order to initiate."
 *
 * Synthetic supports in play, each with one Action, used with `useAbility` so the hand holds only what a test puts
 * there.
