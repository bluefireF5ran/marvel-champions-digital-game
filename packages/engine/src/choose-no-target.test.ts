/**
 * An ability whose required choice has nothing to choose, and the printed "Then".
 *
 * - RRG 1.8 "Choose (Game Element)" (p. 12): "If a player card ability requires the choosing of one or more targets,
 *   and there are no valid targets for any part of the ability, the ability cannot be initiated."
 * - "Target" (pp. 42–43): an ability that requires a target "can only be initiated if it has at least one valid
 *   target"; "Abilities that cause a player to draw one or more cards always have a valid target so long as that
 *   player has at least one card in their deck"; "An ability with a search effect requires only a searchable game area
 *   in order to initiate".
 * - "'Then'" (p. 44): "If the pre-'then' text of an effect does not fully resolve, the post-'then' text does not
 *   attempt to resolve."
 *
 * Synthetic events shaped like Quinjet (03019), Aamir Khan (05006) and Sanctum Sanctorum (09008). PLAN.md's wave 1 gap
 * pass note ("a targeted ability with no legal target is still offered and still runs its 'Then'").
