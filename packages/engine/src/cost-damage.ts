 * (`settleCostDamage`) and the "deal" cost is not (ruling 2026-06-25 R6 and 2026-07-09 R2, Clarity of Purpose: damage
 * dealt as a cost can be reduced or prevented, even to 0, and the cost remains paid). "Initiating Abilities" (p. 24)
 * checks the player's ability to pay at step 3, before anything is paid. The damage itself is assigned and dealt by the
 * same `dealIndirectDamage` / `dealDamage` effect a card's effect uses, pushed above the ability's own frame by
 * `payCost`, so it resolves (with its interrupt and response windows) before the ability's effects; the RRG's
 * "Responses to the text preceding the cost arrow icon resolve before the text following the icon resolves" ("Cost
 * Arrow Icon", p. 14).
