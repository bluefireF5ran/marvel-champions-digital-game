/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.79 (Involuntary Procedures 44034, "after Deadpool takes damage"): a `dealDamage` event carries
 * its target as it took the damage (`TargetSnapshot`, `targetAsDamaged`), and an "after" pattern's top-level name
 * clauses (`TargetQuery.name`, `titled`) are matched against it. Synthetic cards: an identity whose hero face replaces
 * its defeat with "1 remaining hit point, change to alter-ego form", and a support that counts damage by name.
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Identity" (p. 23): "If a card refers to a hero or alter-ego by title, it refers only to the
 * identity with that title, and not to the other side of the card." "Response" (p. 38): a response resolves after its
 * triggering condition, which here is damage the hero face took. The family of `cardLeavesPlay.traits`.
