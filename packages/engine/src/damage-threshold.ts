/**
 * The damage at which a card's own text does something to it, read from its scripted abilities on the face in play:
 * "If there is 5 or more damage here, discard Crossbones' Armor" (`trors` 04065), "Then, if there is at least 5
 * damage here, discard Armored Rhino Suit" (`core` 01098), "if there is at least 9[per_hero] damage here, remove all
 * of it. Then flip Avengers Tower over" (`mts` 21100a). That is any `if` whose condition asks whether the card itself
 * holds at least N damage (`damagedAtLeast` on `self`, or `compare` of `damage` on `self` against a value, resolved
 * for this game so a [per_hero] threshold reads as the real number). Null when the card has no such clause.
 *
 * Display information only: the board shows "2/5" beside the card so the table can see how close it is. The ability
 * itself still decides what happens and when.
