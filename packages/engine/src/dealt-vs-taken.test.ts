/**
 * Damage dealt and damage taken are two amounts on one damage event (owner ruling 2026-10-07, docs/phase7-wave7.md
 * §4.1): "after X deals / is dealt damage" answers damage that reached the damage-dealing process, whatever then kept
 * the target from taking it; "after X takes damage" and "attacks and damages" need damage placed on the target.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Prevent" (p. 35): "the amount of damage that character 'takes' is reduced, but the amount of damage 'dealt'
 * is not reduced"; "If an effect prevents all damage dealt to a character, that character is not considered to have
 * taken damage"; "If all damage from an attack is prevented, the attacking character is considered to have dealt
 * damage, but is not considered to have 'attacked and damaged' the attacked character." "Tough" (p. 44) prevents the
 * same way. Damage that is 0 as it would be dealt is neither (owner ruling 2026-10-06; `zero-damage-no-window.test.ts`).
 *
 * Synthetic cards. Each observer is a forced ability that leaves a counter on the character the damage is aimed at.
