/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.56: `RuleSpec deckDiscardIconCount`, "When counting resources on cards discarded from the top
 * of your deck, count each printed [wild] icon twice" on an identity's hero face, read by the `<bind>.<type>` totals of
 * a `moveCards` and by `ValueSpec totalPrintedResources` over the cards an effect or a cost discarded from that deck.
 * Synthetic cards only: `gadget` carries one action per way of discarding, and each writes what it counted onto `meter`.
 *
 * Sources: MC40 p. 21 FAQ: "When you use an ability that counts resource icons on cards discarded from your deck, each
 * [wild] discarded this way is treated as two [wild] icons" (the icon is wild: the card, and the owner, 2026-10-05), so
 * a count by type reads two wilds; MC40 p. 22: "wild resource icons discarded from the top of your deck count double".
 * RRG 1.8 "Wild Resource" (p. 48): "When resources are not being generated for a cost, a wild resource does not have
 * any characteristic other than 'wild resource.' In such contexts, wild resources cannot be interpreted as any of the
 * other resource types", so the two counted wilds are not two icons of a chosen type. RRG 1.8 "Text Box" (p. 44): a
 * blanked identity has no such ability. Owner decisions §4.1 Q31 = A (any effect or cost that discards from that
 * deck), Q32 = B (a card a response took away is not counted).
