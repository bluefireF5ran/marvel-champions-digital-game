 *
 *   "• A player must choose exactly one identity card.
 *    • A player's deck consists of a minimum of 40 cards and a maximum of 50 cards. The
 *      identity card and any cards with the permanent keyword are not counted as part of
 *      this number.
 *    • A player's deck must include each of the identity-specific cards associated with their
 *      chosen identity card. The exact quantity of each card included in that identity set
 *      must be included in the deck.
 *        [sub-bullet: the Team-Up replacement at setup; see the note on `validateDeck`]
 *    • A player may choose exactly one aspect (Justice, Aggression, Protection, or Leadership)
 *      to use for customization. The remainder of their deck is then customized with cards
 *      that belong to that aspect and/or basic cards.
 *    • No more than three copies (by title) of each non-unique card may be included in the deck.
 *    • A player deck cannot include multiple cards that are considered to 'match' under the
 *      rules for uniqueness (see Unique Icon). The identity is included in this evaluation.
 *    • Any 'deckbuilding requirements' on the player's identity card must be followed."
