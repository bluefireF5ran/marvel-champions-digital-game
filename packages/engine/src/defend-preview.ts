/**
 * The defend prompt's outcome preview: what each option would cost, as a range over the boost cards nobody has turned
 * over yet.
 *
 * `preview()` is no use here — it would truncate at the first `boostCardFlipped`, which is the whole question. So this
 * is its own query, and it is the **one** place the engine does arithmetic in front of facedown cards. That is only
 * allowable because the answer is permutation-invariant over them: it is a bound taken over the *multiset* of cards
 * nobody has seen, never a peek at which card is where.
 *
 * What is public, precisely:
 *  - **The count** of facedown boost cards is exact, not a guess. The procedure deals them in step 1 and only then
 *    moves to step 2 (RRG 1.8 "Attack (Enemy Activation)", p. 9), so by the time the defend prompt is open every boost
 *    card for this attack is already on the enemy — extra ones and any dealt outside an activation (p. 11) included.
 *  - **The icons on each card** are not public until step 3 flips it (p. 9, p. 11), so they only ever appear here as a
 *    bound over the unseen pool.
 *  - **The composition of the unseen pool** is public: the players assembled the encounter deck themselves at setup,
 *    and "Each discard pile is open information, and may be looked at by any player at any time" (p. 16), so *which*
 *    cards remain unseen is legitimately derivable. Only their order is secret (p. 15 "Deck", p. 17 "Encounter Deck").
 *
 * **Flagged, not silently decided:** the RRG never says in so many words that the encounter deck's *contents* are open
 * information. It follows from how the deck is built plus the open discard pile, and every real player counts this
 * way, but it is a rules-adjacent judgement. `scope` exists so the claim can be weakened in one place: `"unseen"`
 * (the default) bounds over the cards nobody has seen; `"wholeSet"` bounds over every card in the assembled deck,
 * seen or not, which is looser but unimpeachable.
 *
 * **Boost abilities are never folded into a number.** A star icon marks a mandatory "Boost" ability (p. 11; p. 40
 * "Star Icon") that can do anything, and p. 11 is explicit that a star is *not* a boost icon and that damage dealt by
 * a boost ability is not damage dealt by the activation. So the bands cover icons only, and the possibility of an
 * ability is reported as counts (`mayTriggerBoostAbility`, `poolWithBoostAbility`) that name no card and compute no
 * probability.
