/**
 * Who may defend an enemy attack, across players (owner rulings 2026-10-06, docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1).
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Defend, Defense" (pp. 14-15) has two limits between players, and both are read here, from one record:
 *  - "Only one player at a time can defend against an enemy attack. While a player is defending, other players cannot
 *    defend against that same attack." A player is defending while a character they control is the attack's defender,
 *    an ally as much as a hero: "If a player defends against an enemy attack that targets a different player (either
 *    by defending with a character they control or by resolving a defense ability), the defending player becomes the
 *    new target of that attack." Resolving a defense ability is itself defending, so the bar covers a "(defense)"
 *    ability as well as being declared the defender.
 *  - "Once a player resolves a defense-labeled ability during an enemy attack, other players cannot resolve
 *    defense-labeled abilities for that same attack."
 *
 * Neither limits the player concerned: "The defending player may resolve any number of defense abilities during an
 * enemy attack", and "Defense-labeled abilities can be played during an attack by a player whose ally is defending
 * that attack. In that case, the player's identity does not become the defender."
 *
 * The record is the attack's own frames, so it ends with the attack: the defender on the attack procedure (or, before
 * the procedure starts and after it ends, on the attack's event frame), and `defenseLabeledBy` on the event frame.
