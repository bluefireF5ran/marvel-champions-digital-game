/**
 * The two limits between players on defending one enemy attack, and the one-defense rule (owner rulings 2026-10-06,
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1). RRG 1.8 "Defend, Defense" (pp. 14-15):
 *  - "Only one player at a time can defend against an enemy attack. While a player is defending, other players cannot
 *    defend against that same attack." A player whose ally defends is defending, and so is one who resolves a defense
 *    ability: "If a player defends against an enemy attack that targets a different player (either by defending with
 *    a character they control or by resolving a defense ability), the defending player becomes the new target".
 *  - "Once a player resolves a defense-labeled ability during an enemy attack, other players cannot resolve
 *    defense-labeled abilities for that same attack."
 *  - Neither binds the player concerned: "The defending player may resolve any number of defense abilities during an
 *    enemy attack", and "Defense-labeled abilities can be played during an attack by a player whose ally is defending
 *    that attack. In that case, the player's identity does not become the defender."
 *
 * Synthetic cards: the villain's ATK is 3 and every boost card has 1 boost icon, so an attack deals 4, or 2 through a
 * hero's DEF of 2. The markers are damage on the villain: the "(defense)" event Shield 1 per play ("when an enemy
 * attacks"), the "(defense)" event Block 10 per play ("when a character would take damage from an attack"), the
 * unlabeled support Watch 100 for each of those two windows, each hero's own forced "after you defend" 1000.
