/**
 * docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.41: `EffectSpec divide.upTo`, "a total of **up to** N … (as you choose)". Synthetic cards
 * shaped like Agile Flight (`stld` 17029): "Hero Action (thwart): Remove a total of up to 5 threat from among schemes
 * (as you choose)."
 *
 * §4 Q16, decided by the user on 2026-09-23: an effect's "up to N" chooses at least one whenever something can be
 * targeted (unless a printed "may" makes it optional), so Agile Flight removes at least 1 threat whenever a scheme holds
 * threat it can lose, and 0 only when none does. Only valid targets are offered (RRG 1.8 "Target", p. 43).
