/**
 * docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 Q55 (owner ruling, B): a character made the defender by a card ability is making a basic
 * defense, so `EffectSpec declareDefender` announces `basicPowerUsing` / `basicPowerUsed` for the defense power exactly
 * as the Declare Defender step does, once per defense, whether or not the character exhausts. Playing a
 * "(defense)"-labeled ability is not by itself a basic defense.
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Defend, Defense" (p. 15): "When a card ability says to 'declare [a hero] the defender' of an
 * attack, that hero is considered to be making a basic defense." "A card ability that allows a hero to be declared as
 * a defender without exhausting can be used on an exhausted hero." (p. 16): "Resolving a defense-labeled ability is
 * not a basic defense and does not cause a hero to reduce the amount of damage dealt by that hero's DEF. That hero can
 * still be declared the defender of the attack during the 'Declare Defender' step or by another card ability."
 *
 * An ally made the defender uses no basic power (FFG ruling Mar 16, 2025; the owner, 2026-10-28, PR #498).
 *
 * Synthetic cards. The stub hero has DEF 2; the villain attacks for 3 (ATK 2 and a 1-icon boost card).
