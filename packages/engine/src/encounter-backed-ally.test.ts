/**
 * docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.71: an ally with an encounter card back under a player's control. Synthetic cards shaped like
 * Longshot (`mojo` 39071: "Longshot does not count against your ally limit. When Revealed: Put Longshot into play under
 * your control. This card gains surge. This effect cannot be canceled."; MojoMania insert p. 2: "The Longshot ally card
 * has an encounter card back") and a Captive ally (`mut_gen` 32089–32092) that counts against the limit.
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Ownership and Control" (p. 31): the scenario owns each encounter card, and only a scenario-specific
 * player card "with a player card back" changes owner when a player takes control of it; "Ally Limit"; "Surge" (p. 42).
 * Decisions: §4 Q41 (he leaves play to the encounter discard pile and can be revealed again), Q14 (in the campaign a
 * Captive ally is the player's for the game), Q42 (ruling Apr 30, 2026 (3) #1: revealed at setup, his When Revealed,
 * surge included, resolves in full).
