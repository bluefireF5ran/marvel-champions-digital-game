/**
 * `TriggerEvent encounterCardBeingDealt` (docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.45): "Interrupt: When a player would be dealt an
 * encounter card, remove 1 recon counter from here instead." One event per card, before it leaves the encounter deck,
 * pushed only when an ability could react; the deal is the event's apply step. A named card's deal (`EffectSpec
 * dealAsEncounterCard`) is heard the same way, with the card as the event's `named` card: replaced, it stays where it
 * was.
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Deal, Deal an Encounter Card" (p. 15); "Villain Phase" (p. 47) step three: "Deal one encounter
 * card to each player. Deal one additional card for each hazard icon on a card in play. These additional cards are
 * dealt in player order."; "Player Deck" (p. 33); "Surge" (p. 42: "the player resolving the card deals themself a
 * facedown encounter card", a deal by the owner's decision docs/phase7-wave9.md §4.1 Q19 = B); "'Would'" (p. 48);
 * "Replacement Effect" (p. 37): "When an effect is replaced, it is no longer considered imminent and no further
 * interrupts or responses to that effect can be triggered."; "Cost" (p. 13).
 *
 * Synthetic cards only: a screen that replaces a deal while it holds a recon counter, a watcher that only counts the
 * deals it hears coming, a witness of the cards dealt, and the things that deal.
