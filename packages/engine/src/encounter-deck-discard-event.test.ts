/**
 * docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.43 (b) and (c): `TriggerEvent cardDiscardedFromDeck` announced for the encounter deck
 * (`deck: "encounter"`), and `abilityResolved` carrying the resolved ability's slots (`moment.<slot>`). Synthetic cards
 * only, each test driving real commands:
 *
 * - `solutions`: Serpent Solutions' shape (`falcon` 53031), "Forced Response: After a Serpent Society minion is
 *   discarded from the top of the encounter deck, deal that minion to the first player as a facedown encounter card";
 * - `watch`: a forced "after a card is discarded from the top of the encounter deck" that counts what it hears, by an
 *   effect and by a cost apart;
 * - `mine`: a forced "after you discard a card from the top of your deck", which must never hear the encounter deck;
 * - `eye`: Eagle-Eyed's shape, "discard the top card of the encounter deck → …", and `talon`: Talon Line's (53012),
 *   "Response: After you resolve [eye's] ability, discard this card → for each icon in the discarded card's boost
 *   area, …".
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Triggering Condition" (p. 45): the conditions one occurrence creates "are handled with … a single
 * response window"; "Encounter Deck" (p. 17): an emptied deck is reset at once, and the discard is not continued with
 * the new deck; "Look, Looked-At" (p. 27): looked-at cards "are still considered part of that deck"; "Boost, Boost
 * Icon" (p. 11): a boost card is discarded after it is applied, from the enemy it was given to, and a star is not a
 * boost icon; "Resolve" (p. 37). Owner decisions docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1 Q32 (a card a response took away is not
 * counted by the ability that discarded it) and Q33 (a card the reset shuffled away is answered where it now is).
