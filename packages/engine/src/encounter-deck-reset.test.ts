/**
 * docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.60: the encounter deck resets as an event (§4.1 Q38: at the move that empties it, not at the
 * next draw). Synthetic cards shaped like Wheel of Genres, Spinning (`mojo` 39026a): "Forced Response: After the
 * encounter deck resets, if there are no set-aside modular encounter sets remaining, the players lose the game.
 * Otherwise, flip this card." — counted on the listening environment here.
 *
 * Sources:
 * - RRG 1.8 "Encounter Deck" (p. 17): "If the encounter deck is empty, the encounter discard pile is immediately
 *   shuffled to create a new encounter deck. When this occurs, place an acceleration token next to the main scheme
 *   deck." / "If a card ability discards a specified number of cards from the encounter deck or until a card with
 *   specific criteria is discarded, discard cards from the encounter deck until the discard condition is met or the
 *   encounter deck is empty. If the encounter deck is emptied this way, that card ability is considered to be
 *   fulfilled. Do not continue the discard effect with the newly shuffled encounter deck." / "If the encounter deck
 *   empties during the resolution of any other type of game effect (for example, the dealing of encounter cards), that
 *   effect finishes resolving after the encounter deck has been reset."
 * - Ruling, April 30, 2026 (3), question 7: "If the last sentence of an event empties the deck, is it shuffled into
 *   the new deck?" Answer 7: "The deck is reshuffled **before** the currently resolving card enters the discard pile."
 * - The Wrecking Crew insert, "Multiple Villains and Encounter Decks": "When a villain's encounter deck is empty,
 *   shuffle its discard pile back into its encounter deck and place an acceleration token" — only that deck.
