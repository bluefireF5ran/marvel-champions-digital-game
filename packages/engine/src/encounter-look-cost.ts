 * payer while it is open (`visibility.ts`); exactly `discard` must be picked. Second pass: the picks are discarded one
 * at a time in deck order, top first (RRG 1.8 "Discard", p. 16: discarded "from the top of that deck", "one at a time
 * (without changing the order)"), each faceup into its own discard pile; the move that empties the deck resets it
 * (§3.60). The cards not picked never moved, so they are still on top in their order (RRG 1.8 "Look, Looked-At",
 * p. 27). The picks are bound to `slot` on the paid-for frame, with `<slot>.count` and `<slot>.boostIcons` (read as
 * each card is discarded, before it moves, as `discardEncounterCards` does).
 *
 * Checked payable by `planCost`; should the deck still have fewer cards than `discard` here, the cost is not paid:
 * nothing is discarded and the paid-for frame is marked (`COST_NOT_PAID_VAR`) so its effects do not resolve.
