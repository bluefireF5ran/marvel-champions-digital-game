/**
 * docs/competitive-mode-plan.md §3.4 and §4 task 7 (docs/phase7-wave10.md §3.5): who makes a choice a card gives to
 * "the enemy team", and what the pending choice and the log say about it.
 *
 * Sources: MC56 p. 6 (cooperative play): "Any rule or ability that refers to 'the enemy team' refers to the players.
 * Resolve these abilities using the grim rule: Imagine what an opponent would do if it were their choice." The rulebook
 * names no one player; the owner's decision (2026-10-11, question 6, answer A) is the first player, as for what an
 * encounter card leaves open (RRG 1.8 "First Player", p. 19). No setup makes a second team, so the two-team side is
 * read on `twoTeamState`.
