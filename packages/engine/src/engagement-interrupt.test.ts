/**
 * Interrupts to a minion engaging a player ("Hero Interrupt: When you engage a minion", Anticipation; "Interrupt: When a
 * minion would engage a player", Target Spotter), proven with synthetic cards.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Engage" (p. 18): a minion entering play in a player's play area engages that player; an ability telling a
 * player to engage a minion counts as it engaging them. "Interrupt" (p. 25): resolves immediately before its triggering
 * condition resolves. "Response" (p. 38). "Triggering Condition" (p. 45): one occurrence's conditions share a single
 * interrupt window. FAQ "Target Spotter (#38)" (p. 65): it "interrupts the engagement of that minion". "After you engage"
 * responses keep their place after the minion's keywords (ruling Jan 17, 2026 (3) answer 2). A revealed minion's
 * quickstrike resolves after its When Revealed (RRG 1.8 "Quickstrike", p. 36; the owner's answer 30B, 2026-10-12, over
 * ruling Feb 28, 2026 (4) answer 2).
