   * seats pick matching identities, by `playCard`, and by the cost pick of an ability that
   * would put a matching card into play.
   *
   * Distinct from `invalid_setup` because it is a legal-but-conflicting *player* choice
   * rather than a malformed config, so a client can route it to "pick a different hero".
   * Distinct from `no_valid_target` because that code also carries `playRestrictions`
