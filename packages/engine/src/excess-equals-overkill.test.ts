/**
 * "Excess damage dealt" counts the overkill value. RRG 1.8 "Overkill" (p. 31, revised in 1.8): "If a card ability counts
 * excess damage dealt, that ability counts the same value of excess damage that is calculated when resolving the
 * overkill keyword." That supersedes rulings Feb 8, 2026 (2) and Jan 26, 2026 (3), which measured excess *dealt* before
 * reductions (user decision 2026-09-25; PLAN.md's Overkill note; `resolve/event.ts` `excessDamageOf`).
 *
 * FFG's Feb 8 example, with synthetic cards: Hercules attacks Thumbelina (3 HP, "reduce the damage she takes by 1") for 6
 * with Golden Mace's overkill. She takes 5; overkill spills 5 − 3 = 2 onto the villain; an ability counting excess
 * damage dealt (`excessDealt`) also reads 2. Prince of Power itself is the one exception since owner answer 31B
 * (2026-10-12): it reads the separate `excessAsDealt` (3, as the ruling said), `excess-as-dealt.test.ts`.
