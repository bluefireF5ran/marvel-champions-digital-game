/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.25 items 1–2: an ally that belongs to an encounter set, has the setup keyword and reads "The
 * first player controls [this]. [This] does not count against your ally limit." Synthetic cards only: the Ward (that
 * ally, with an encounter card back), a player's own setup ally, and a Ward without the control rule.
 *
 * Sources and the readings pinned here:
 * - RRG 1.8 Appendix II step 11 (p. 51) and "Setup (Keyword)" (p. 39): "A card with the setup keyword begins the game in
 *   play", found by searching "each deck". An ally found in the encounter deck enters play in the first player's play
 *   area, ready, under their control.
 * - "Ownership and Control" (p. 31): "The scenario is considered to be the owner of the encounter deck and each encounter
 *   card"; "Control of a card remains constant unless an ability explicitly causes the card to change control"; "If a
 *   character changes control while it is in play, it remains in the same state (i.e., readied or exhausted, damaged or
 *   not, etc.) and is moved to its new controller's play area"; "Upgrades on a card that changes control also change
 *   control to the same new controller".
 * - "First Player" (p. 19): the token passes at the end of the round, and "If the first player is eliminated, the first
 *   player token immediately passes clockwise to the next player". The RRG does not say whether "The first player
 *   controls X" names the player who is first now or the one who was first at setup. It is a constant ability in the
 *   present tense, so it is read as the explicit ability that changes control each time the token passes (the reading
 *   `RuleSpec controlledByFirstPlayer` already has for a support, docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.13).
 * - "Player Elimination" (p. 33): step 1 passes the token, step 3 discards the cards "in the eliminated player's play
 *   area" that they do not own. The ally follows the token at step 1, so it is no longer in that play area at step 3
 *   and stays in play. Without the control rule it is still there, and goes to the encounter discard pile.
 * - "Ally Limit" (p. 7): an ally that does not count is neither counted nor offered for the discard.
 *
 * Step 11 as written also searches the encounter set-aside area (docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1 Q20 = B); that half is
 * pinned in `setup-keyword-set-aside.test.ts`, and nothing here sets a setup-keyword card aside.
