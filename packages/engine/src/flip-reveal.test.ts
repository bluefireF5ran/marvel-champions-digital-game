/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.14, §3.34 item 2 (queue task 13): "Flip this card and reveal it" / "flip this card and reveal
 * [its other face]" on an encounter card that is not a villain (`flipCard { reveal: true }`). Synthetic cards shaped
 * like a double-sided permanent attachment whose b face has a When Revealed (a `flipSide` card) and a side scheme whose
 * other face is a side scheme of its own with a When Revealed (`otherFaceId` cards).
 *
 * Sources: the cards' own "flip this card and reveal" text; RRG 1.8 "Flip" (p. 20: the same card type "retains all
 * attached cards, tucked cards, status cards, and tokens"), "Side Scheme" (p. 40: "enters play with an amount of threat
 * on it equal to the card's starting threat value"), "Hinder X" (p. 22), "Incite X" (p. 24), "Peril" (p. 32), "Surge"
 * (p. 42), "Reveal" (p. 38); FAQ "Dial M for Mojo (#35)" (a villain's new face is revealed, so its reveal keywords
 * resolve; docs/phase7-wave6.md §4.1 Q36); rulings Jan 26, 2026 (4) answer 2, Apr 30, 2026 (3) answer 3 and Jun 25,
 * 2026 (4) answer 3 (an environment that flips is not revealed). Decisions §4.1 Q10 and Q19.
 *
 * The reading pinned here for "when an encounter card is revealed" abilities: the rulings refuse them on a flip whose
 * text does not say "reveal". A flip whose text does say it is a reveal, so those windows open; it is not a reveal
 * *from the encounter deck* (the frame's `source` is `elsewhere`), which is the reason the January ruling gives.
