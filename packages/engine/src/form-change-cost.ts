/**
 * Paying an additional cost to change form (`RuleSpec formChangeCost`, docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.63): "As an additional
 * cost to change to hero form during your turn, you must spend 2 resources of the same type."
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Cost" (p. 14): "A player must pay all additional costs simultaneously with the cost that is being added to,
 * even if multiple cards or abilities are adding separate additional costs. [...] if they cannot pay for all of the
 * costs at once, then they do not pay any of the costs and the effect associated with the costs does not occur."
 *
 * There is no second cost model here. Each cost is an `AbilityCost`, checked by `planCost`, priced by `priceOf`, judged
 * by `resourceVars` (where "of the same type" and a chosen size are read off the payment) and paid by `payPayment` and
 * `payCost`: the steps `useAbility` takes for an ability's cost. Both ways a player changes form go through
 * `planFormChangeCosts`: the `changeForm` command, which carries the payment, and a `changeForm` effect of a player
 * card, which asks for it (`executeChangeForm`).
 *
 * - The payment is the changing player's alone and pays for no card (`payingFor` null): no alliance, no other
 *   player's hand, and no resource generated "for" a kind of card (`generatesFor`).
 * - Overpaying is legal (RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 13), so [energy][energy][mental] pays "2 resources of the same type".
 * - **Several costs at once** are planned one by one and paid from one payment that must cover their total. Each
 *   cost's own shape ("of the same type") is judged against that total, not jointly with another cost's shape, and
 *   the costs share the command's `costChoices`: exact while at most one of the costs constrains the payment's shape
 *   or picks cards, which is every pairing the card pool prints.
