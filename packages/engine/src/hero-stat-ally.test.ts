/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.25 items 3–5: an encounter-set ally reading "[star] The Ward's base THW and base ATK are equal
 * to the THW and ATK of your hero. If the Ward leaves play, the players lose the game.", and a scheme reading "Forced
 * Interrupt: When the villain attacks, he attacks the Ward instead. (Other characters may defend the attack.)".
 * Synthetic cards only. Items 1–2 (entering play, control following the token) are `first-player-setup-ally.test.ts`.
 *
 * Sources and the readings pinned here:
 * - RRG 1.8 "Star Icon" (pp. 40–41): "that value is defined in that card's text. If it is not defined … that value is
 *   treated as 0"; ruling January 17, 2026 - Ruling 1: "the value of a star icon is defined by its associated ability
 *   (defaulting to 0 only when there is no associated ability)", and an effect copying this ally's base stats "adds
 *   your hero's power values". "Base Value" (p. 10): "A defined value before modifiers are applied"; "Modifiers"
 *   (p. 29): a quantity is recalculated from "the unmodified base value and all active modifiers". So the ally's base
 *   is its controller's hero's THW and ATK as they stand now (the hero's own modifiers included: "your hero's basic
 *   powers", not "printed"), and modifiers on the ally apply on top.
 * - Owner decision §4.1 Q14 = B: while the controller is in alter-ego form no hero is in play, the star is undefined,
 *   and THW and ATK are 0, whatever modifies the identity card.
 * - RRG 1.8 "Leaves Play" (p. 27): "any time when a card transitions from an in-play area to an out-of-play area".
 *   `RuleSpec leavingPlayLoses` (docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.8) is read as the card moves, so the loss comes with the move:
 *   after every "when it leaves play" interrupt (docs/phase7-wave5.md §4.1 Q17: interrupts resolve before the card
 *   moves), and not at all when a replacement leaves the card in play. A change of controller moves it between two
 *   play areas, which is not leaving play ("Ownership and Control", p. 31).
 * - RRG 1.8 "Attack (Enemy Activation)" (pp. 8–10): an ability can "cause an enemy to attack … an ally that player
 *   controls", and "the player is still considered attacked". Owner decisions §4.1 Q16 = A (once the attack goes to
 *   the ally, its controller is the attacked player, whoever it was first aimed at) and Q5 = A ("attacks you"
 *   abilities resolve against the attacked player when their ally is attacked). `retargetAttack` (§3.9) already does
 *   this; nothing in the engine changed for it.
