/**
 * docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.29 (a): hidden piles (`GameState.hiddenPiles`), the cards that have come out of them
 * (`GameState.revealedPileCards`), `EffectSpec dealHiddenPiles` / `gainFromHiddenPile` / `revealHiddenPile`, and what
 * a player is shown of them (`hiddenPileViews`, `sealHiddenPiles`, the event log, `legalActions`, `preview`).
 *
 * Sources: MC50 p. 5, "Preparing the Evidence": "1. Separate the nine evidence cards (185–193) by their card backs
 * into three sets of three cards. 2. Shuffle each set of three cards separately and put one card from each set into the
 * A.I.M. envelope **without looking at them**. 3. Shuffle the six remaining evidence cards together and put them in the
 * S.H.I.E.L.D. envelope **without looking at them**." MC50 p. 18: "When the players gain an evidence card, they turn it
 * faceup". MC50 p. 19: "the players take the evidence cards from the A.I.M. envelope".
 *
 * Synthetic cards only: nine clue cards of the set "clues" (three of each kind), a tenth of another set, a main scheme
 * whose Setup deals them into the piles "sealed" (one of each kind) and "open" (the other six), and a Desk support
 * whose abilities gain from and reveal the piles.
