/**
 * docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.25: an attachment that prints no "attach to" text and makes its own host. "When Revealed:
 * Discard cards from the top of the encounter deck until you discard a minion. Reveal that minion and attach this card
 * to it."
 *
 * Ruling February 20, 2026 – Ruling 4: "Reveal rules assume an attachment has 'attach to' text resolving upon being
 * revealed. If an attachment lacks 'attach to' text, it attaches when its 'When Revealed' ability triggers", which
 * corrects RRG 1.8 "Reveal" (p. 38) step 2 for these cards. So the card is turned faceup in front of the revealing
 * player, out of play (RRG 1.8 "In Play and Out of Play", p. 23: "If a card is out of play, its text is inactive and
 * cannot affect the game"), its When Revealed resolves, and it is discarded if it is still unattached afterward (RRG
 * 1.8 "Attach To", p. 8: "If such a card cannot remain in its prior state or game area, discard it"). A discard that
 * empties the encounter deck ends the search: "that card ability is considered to be fulfilled" (RRG 1.8 "Encounter
 * Deck", p. 17). The reveal step itself is proven in `self-attaching-attachment.test.ts`; this file proves the shape
 * that finds its host by revealing it. Synthetic cards only.
