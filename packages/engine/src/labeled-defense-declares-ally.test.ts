/**
 * A "(defense)"-labeled ability that declares another character the defender. RRG 1.8 FAQ "Mutant Protectors (#17)"
 * (p. 63): "When a player plays Mutant Protectors, that player becomes the target of the enemy attack and the X-Men
 * ally put into play becomes the defender. If the defending ally leaves play before damage is dealt for the attack,
 * the player's hero becomes the defender and can trigger 'after you defend' responses after the attack resolves.
 * (This is not a basic defense, and the villain's attack is not reduced by the hero's DEF.)"
 *
 * Synthetic cards: the villain's ATK is 3, each boost card has 1 boost icon, the hero's DEF is 2, the ally has 3 hit
 * points.
