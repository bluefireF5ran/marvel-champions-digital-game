/**
 * `legalActions` and an Action a player may trigger on a card they do not control. RRG 1.8 "Action" (p. 6): "Players
 * can only trigger action abilities on cards they control or on encounter cards", during their own turn or by request
 * during another player's; text naming who may trigger an ability (`triggerableBy`, docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.11: "Any
 * player may trigger this ability", "Any player can do this") replaces the controller rule. The listing reads the same
 * `triggeringPlayers` the `useAbility` command does and every entry is probed through the command, so a listed entry
 * is an accepted command and the two cannot drift.
 *
 * Synthetic cards: the Stash is shaped like Plot Convenience (`deadpool` 44050: a support, "Action: Exhaust … Any
 * player may trigger this ability"), the Cache like its "attach 1 aspect card from your hand" condition (read against
 * the triggering player's hand), the Hush like The Merc with the Mouth (44032: "Other players cannot resolve player
 * card abilities during your turn"), the Beacon like a campaign environment ("Any player can do this").
