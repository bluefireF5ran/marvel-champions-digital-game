/**
 * Official rule, RRG 1.8 "Main Scheme" (p. 27), when the main scheme deck advances: "1. Remove the top main scheme card
 * from the game. Return all tokens (except acceleration tokens) that were on that card to the token pool and discard
 * each card attached to it." Each card goes to its owner's discard pile: an encounter card to the encounter discard
 * pile, a player card to its owner's (RRG 1.8 "Ownership and Control", p. 31). A permanent player card cannot leave
 * play (RRG 1.8 "Permanent", p. 32) and cannot stay on a card that is out of play ("Attach To", p. 8), so it is
 * unattached in play, as when any other host leaves (docs/phase7-wave5.md §3.30).
 *
 * Synthetic cards: a three-stage scheme, a player upgrade and an encounter attachment attached to it by card effects.
