/**
 * docs/phase7-wave10.md §3.13: hinder on a main scheme stage, printed or gained under a condition.
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Hinder X" (p. 22): "A card with the hinder X keyword enters play with X threat on it", "in
 * addition to any threat it normally enters play with"; MC56 p. 9: "When a card with hinder X enters play, place X
 * threat on that card." RRG 1.8 "Per Player Icon" (p. 32). The Civil War stage 1B cards: "If there is more than 1
 * player on your team, this stage gains hinder 2[per_hero]."
 *
 * Synthetic cards. `gained`: stage 1B gains hinder 2 per player while there is more than 1 player; stage 2B has none.
 * `printed`: stage 1B prints hinder 1 + 2 per player beside a starting threat of 1 per player; stage 2B prints hinder 3
 * beside a starting threat of 2.
