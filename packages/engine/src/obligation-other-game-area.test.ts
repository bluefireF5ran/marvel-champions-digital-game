/**
 * FFG ruling Sep 21, 2023 (post-RRG 1.5 #89): a player who reveals
 * another player's identity-specific obligation while that player is in a different game area (Kang Stage 2B) treats it
 * "as if the player was eliminated from the game: ignore the obligation's ability, remove it from the game, and reveal a
 * new encounter card to replace it. (Otherwise, play with the obligation as normal.)" RRG 1.8 "Obligation" (p. 30): "If
 * an obligation cannot be given to the specified player for any reason, ignore the card's ability, remove it from the
 * game, and reveal an additional encounter card."
