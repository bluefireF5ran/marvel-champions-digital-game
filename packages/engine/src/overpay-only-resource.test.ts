/**
 * `AbilityDefinition.overpayOnly` (docs/phase7-wave10-hero-packs.md H3.14, engine task HT11): "Resource: Generate a
 * [energy] resource to overpay for a card. (Limit once per card.)" What the ability generates joins a payment only as
 * overpayment: the rest of the payment covers the cost by itself, and these resources are always in `overpaid.*`.
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Cost" (p. 13): "While paying a cost, a player is permitted to generate resources beyond the
 * specified cost. Resources generated beyond the specified cost are considered to have been overpaid for that cost and
 * were not paid for that cost."; "Resource Ability" (p. 37); "Limit" (pp. 26-27). Ruling January 17, 2026 - Ruling 4
 * (1): "When generating a wild resource, you specify which resource type it represents, even when overpaying a cost."
 * Owner decision, 2026-10-12 (hero-packs Q20 = A): the resource is offered only while a card is being played.
 *
 * Synthetic cards only. The probe events put what they read of their own payment into the villain's damage, one
 * column each: 1 for resolving, 10 per `overpaid.energy`, 100 per `overpaid.physical`, 1,000 per `overpaid.total`,
 * 10,000 per `paid.count`, 100,000 per `paid.total`.
