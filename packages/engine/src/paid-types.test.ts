/**
 * docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.62, half (a): the resource types a payment used. `paid.count`; the wilds a player declares
 * (`playCard.wildAs`, the `declareWildTypes` choice and its one shortcut); `readsPaidTypes` and `RuleSpec
 * readsPaymentTypesOf`; `ValueSpec paidTypeCount` and `Predicate paidType`; the payment stamped on `cardPlayed`; the
 * log's `wildTypesDeclared`. Proven with synthetic cards driving real `playCard` commands and choices.
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Wild Resource" (p. 48: "When a player generates a wild resource, they may specify which resource
 * type (energy, mental, physical, or wild) it is being used as"), "Cost" (p. 13: resources generated beyond the cost
 * "were not paid for that cost"), "Resource" (p. 37: four types); FAQ "Unstoppable Force (#6)" (p. 60: at a cost of 0
 * nothing was paid); ruling January 17, 2026 - Ruling 4 (1): "you specify which resource type it represents, even when
 * overpaying a cost". Owner decisions §4.1 Q33 = B (the player declares; the engine never picks, and skips the question
 * only when every declaration reads the same), Q34 = A (overpaid resources are not read) and their follow-up (the paid
 * resources are the ones that give the most declared types, with no further prompt).
 *
 * Every probe writes what it read as damage on the villain, so one number names the reading.
