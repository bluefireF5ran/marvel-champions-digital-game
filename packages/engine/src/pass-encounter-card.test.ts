/**
 * docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.75 (b): `EffectSpec passEncounterCard { cards, from, to }` and `PlayerRef nextAfter`, proven
 * with synthetic cards shaped like The Crazy Gang ("Forced Response: After a non-[ELITE] minion schemes against a
 * player, deal that minion to that player as a facedown encounter card. Then, if there is more than 1 player in the
 * game, pass that facedown encounter card to the next player."; 2 starting threat per player, an acceleration icon),
 * Jester (SCH 0, ATK 1, 5 hit points, "When Revealed: You are confused"), Executioner (SCH 0, ATK 2, 4 hit points,
 * "When Revealed: Executioner attacks the friendly character with the fewest remaining hit points"), Azazel (ELITE,
 * SCH 2) and a permanent player upgrade attached to an enemy (Frostbite).
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "In Player Order" (p. 24): "The phrase 'next player' always refers to the next (clockwise) player
 * in player order"; "Deal, Deal an Encounter Card" (p. 15): a dealt card "is added to the queue of cards that player
 * resolves during the villain phase", and one dealt "during step three or four of the villain phase … is added to the
 * queue of cards that are being dealt and revealed in those same steps"; "Villain Phase" step 4 (p. 47): each player
 * reveals their encounter cards "one card at a time in the order in which they were dealt"; "Confuse, Confused"
 * (p. 13): a confused enemy does not scheme; "Leaves Play" (p. 27); "Permanent" (p. 32); "'Then'" (p. 44).
 *
 * Synthetic cards only; the engine never names a card.
