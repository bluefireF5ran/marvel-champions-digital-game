/**
 * QA of PR #122 (v0.20.0): "numbers each picked card in the order it will be discarded and tags the last one 'on top'".
 * The client promise (view/payment-model.ts `PaymentSourceView.onTop`): the last picked hand card "ends up on top of
 * your discard pile".
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Discard" p. 16 (the player chooses the order of cards one effect discards from their hand);
 * RRG 1.8 "Event" p. 18 (an event card is discarded after its effect resolves, so it lands on its owner's discard pile
 * AFTER the cards that paid for it); FAQ "Pepper Potts (#33)" p. 57 (reads the top card of the discard pile).
