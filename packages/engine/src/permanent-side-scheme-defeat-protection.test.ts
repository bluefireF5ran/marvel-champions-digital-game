/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.34 items 1, 3 and 4 (queue task 21): what a double-sided permanent side scheme needs besides
 * its flip-and-reveal (`flip-reveal.test.ts`). Synthetic cards: a permanent side scheme that answers "after the last
 * threat is removed from this scheme", a side scheme whose constant says "the villain cannot be defeated", and
 * listeners on a villain stage's defeat.
 *
 * Sources and readings:
 * - RRG 1.8 "Permanent" (p. 32): "A card with the permanent keyword cannot be defeated, leave play, … except by card
 *   abilities in the same set." RRG 1.8 "Defeat" (p. 15): "if a side scheme has no threat on it, it is defeated", and
 *   "Side Scheme" (p. 40): it "remains in play until there is no threat on it (which causes it to be defeated and
 *   discarded)". Reaching no threat is the game's rule, not a card ability of its set, so by the text a permanent side
 *   scheme with no threat is not defeated (owner ruling 2026-10-05, docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1): no `schemeDefeated`,
 *   no When Defeated, nothing for "after you defeat a side scheme", and it stays in play with no threat. "After the
 *   last threat is removed from this scheme" is a result of the removal (`lastThreatRemoved`) and still answers.
 * - RRG 1.8 "Defeat" (p. 15): "If a character has zero or fewer remaining hit points … it is defeated"; "'Cannot'"
 *   (p. 11) is absolute while the rule lasts. Owner decision §4.1 Q21 = A: when the rule ends with the villain at zero
 *   or fewer hit points, that stage is defeated at once, with no defeating player; RRG 1.8 "Villain Defeat" (p. 47)
 *   then reveals the next stage or wins the game.
