/**
 * docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.42: playing a card chosen in an ability's cost, and remembering how. Synthetic cards shaped like
 * Wolverine's Claws (35002: "Exhaust Wolverine's Claws, choose an ATTACK event in your hand, and take damage equal to its
 * printed cost → play that event, ignoring its resource cost. That attack gains piercing.") and Lunging Strike (35010:
 * "If you exhausted Wolverine's Claws to play this card, this attack gains overkill").
 *
 * - `AbilityCost.chooseCard` picks the event in the cost; `damageSelf` reads its printed cost.
 * - `playFromHand.card` plays exactly that card, `via` records the Claws on the play (`Predicate playedVia`), and
 *   `whileResolving` grants "that attack gains piercing" for that play only.
 *
 * Sources: the cards' text; RRG 1.8 "Cost" (p. 13: a cost whose effect has no valid target cannot be paid), "Ignore"
 * (p. 23), "Piercing" (p. 32).
