/**
 * docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.37: a card searched for in the deck and played at a reduced cost (`EffectSpec playFromHand
 * { from: "deck", costReduction }`). Synthetic cards shaped like Shuri's Inventor (`bp` 51001b): "Action: Exhaust
 * [this card] → search your deck for a [Gizmo] upgrade and play it, reducing its resource cost by 2. (Limit once per
 * round.)"
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Search" (p. 39): the player looks at each card of the searched area, and "if any portion of a deck
 * is searched, upon completion of that game step, game function, or card ability, shuffle that entire deck"; "Target"
 * (p. 43): "An ability with a search effect requires only a searchable game area in order to initiate"; "Initiating
 * Abilities" (p. 24), steps 3 and 5: a card whose cost cannot be paid is not played; "Play, Put Into Play" (p. 32).
