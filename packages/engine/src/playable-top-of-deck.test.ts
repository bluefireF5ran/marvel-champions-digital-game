/**
 * docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.49: "Once per phase, you may play the top card of your deck as if it was in your hand,
 * reducing its resource cost by 1." (the constant's `playableTopOfDeck`, with the ability's own once-per-phase limit).
 * Proven with synthetic cards shaped like Magik's kit (`aoa` 45030a, 45031, 45036 to 45040) and the cards the RRG's FAQ
 * names, each test driving real commands and choices.
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 FAQ "Magik (#30A)" (p. 64), all four entries (tests 1, 3, 4 and 5); "Initiating Abilities" (p. 24):
 * the card leaves its zone at step 1, before costs are paid (the FAQ calls it step 3; no behavior differs); "Play, Put
 * into Play" (p. 32): "A card that is put into play is not considered to have been played"; "Limit" (p. 27): a
 * canceled use still counts; "Cost" (p. 13). Owner decisions §4.1 Q27 = A (played through a "play a card from your
 * hand" effect, both reductions apply) and Q26 = B.
 *
 * The test numbers in the titles are §3.49's. Test 10 (a campaign game's mission area) waits for §3.34 and §3.35.
