/**
 * "What would this command do?" — an outcome preview, computed by running the command through the engine and throwing
 * the resulting state away.
 *
 * This is the same trick `legalActions` uses to decide legality (`legal.ts`'s `probe`), and it works for the same
 * reason: `applyCommand` is pure and `Ctx.state` is *replaced*, never mutated, so a probe cannot touch the caller's
 * state — its RNG included, since `RngState` is a field of `GameState`. A preview is a query. It never enters a
 * `GameLog`, never advances `rng`/`nextChoiceSeq`/`nextFrameSeq`, and is invisible to `replay()`.
 *
 * **The diff is the events, with totals read off the two states.** A numeric diff of `instances` can say
 * `damage: 9 → 14` but cannot say *why*; the engine already emits the distinctions a player asks about —
 * `damagePrevented{reason:"tough"}`, `overkillSpilled`, `threatRemovalBlocked`, `uniqueEntryBlocked`,
 * `leavePlayBlocked`, `activationSkipped` — and events carry order, which a state diff does not. So `events` is the
 * probe's own event list and `counters` is before/after for each instance those events named, read through the same
 * selectors the live board reads. Nothing here is recomputed and no rule is restated: `OutcomePreview` contains no
 * prose and no arithmetic of its own.
 *
 * **What it will not tell you.** A preview stops rather than peek — see `PreviewStop` and `truncate` below. It also
 * never auto-answers a nested choice: that would be the engine deciding, and would be wrong exactly when the answer
 * matters. A client that wants "and then, whichever you pick, …" calls `preview` again on each answer.
 *
 * A preview is what happens *if nobody responds*: an optional interrupt/response window parks a choice and stops the
 * preview there, while a *forced* one resolves inside it (RRG 1.8 "Ability", p. 5, simultaneous timing priority;
 * "Attack (Enemy Activation)" step 6, p. 9) — correct, because a forced ability is mandatory and public, and whether
 * another player will spend a card is not something the engine may predict.

 * How many events are certain, stated over zones rather than over a list of risky event kinds.

 * Every instance is classified against the **pre-probe** state, and the prefix ends at the first event that

 *      shuffle's new order; or
 *  (b) names a card that was facedown out of a deck and is faceup once the command finishes (`faceHidden` then
 *      revealed) — a boost card left over from an earlier round being flipped, a facedown Drone turned over.
 *  (c) names a card that was in a hidden pile (`GameState.hiddenPiles`, docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.29 (a)) — a card gained
 *      from a pile or a pile turned faceup. A pile's card is a card id and never an instance, and no other event names
 *      it by that id while it is hidden, so any mention is the reveal. Needed beside `randomPrefix`: taking a pile's
 *      last cards, or all of them, draws nothing from the random stream.
 *
 *  (d) names a double-sided card whose other face no player may look at (`CardInstance.reverseHidden`,
 *      docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.54) and that has flipped once the command finishes: what its other face is, and all it
 *      then does, is not the previewing player's to know. Like (b), a mention of a card that stays as it is does not
 *      truncate (a counter placed on it that is not the last one).
 *
 * Damaging a facedown Drone does *not* truncate: naming a facedown card is not reading it, and the Drone is still
 * facedown afterwards. That distinction is why (b) asks about the post-state's `faceup` rather than treating every
 * mention of a facedown card as a reveal.
