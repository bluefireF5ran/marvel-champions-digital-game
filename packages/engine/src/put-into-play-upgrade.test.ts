/**
 * An upgrade an effect puts into play enters play as playing it would, and `TargetQuery.canAttachTo` asks the same
 * question of a card out of play. Both read `upgradeHostCandidates` (`attachment-hosts.ts`), the decision a play makes.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Play, Put into Play" (p. 32): "Unless otherwise stated by the 'put into play' effect, cards that are put into
 * play must do so in a play area or state that matches the rules of playing the card", and "A card that is put into
 * play is not considered to have been played". "Attach To" (p. 8): the card "must be attached to … the specified game
 * element as it enters play"; "If the initial 'attach to' check does not pass, the card is not able to be attached, so
 * it remains in its prior state or game area." "Upgrade" (p. 46): "Most upgrade cards enter play near a player's
 * identity card"; "Ownership and Control" (p. 31): an upgrade on a card another player controls is that player's.
 *
 * "When Defeated: Each player may search their deck and discard pile for a WEAPON upgrade … and put it into play" (Lock
 * and Load, `next_evol` 40019); "choose an upgrade in any player's discard pile with a cost of 1 or less that can be
 * attached to Deathlok. Attach that upgrade to Deathlok." (40025). Synthetic cards throughout.
