/**
 * "Resolve its 'Forced Response' as if it just attacked you →" as an ability cost (`AbilityCost.resolveAbility`;
 * docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.11): whether it can be paid, and the steps that pay it.
 *
 * The cost is paid by resolving another card's printed abilities of one kind, the same `resolveSpecials` effect a
 * card's "resolve the 'Forced Response' on the active villain" uses, pushed by `payCost` above the frame it pays for
 * (`enemy-attack-cost.ts`'s pattern), so those abilities resolve in full before that frame's effects: "Nonbolded text
 * before the cost arrow icon must be paid and/or resolved in full before the text after the cost arrow icon can be
 * resolved" (RRG 1.8 "Cost Arrow Icon", p. 14).
 *
 * **Not payable when resolving them would change nothing** (owner decision §4.1 Q7 = A, "the normal valid-target and
 * initiation rule"): RRG 1.8 "Initiating Abilities" (p. 24) refuses an ability whose cost cannot be paid, and "Cost"
 * (p. 13) has a cost paid in full or not at all. Whether resolving would change anything is not guessed from the
 * abilities' shape: `resolvingWouldChange` resolves them on a copy of the state and looks.

 * has answered yes at the frame that changed it, before any of them would have run. It is looked at after every frame
