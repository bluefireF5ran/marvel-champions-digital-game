/**
 * One "(attack)" ability is one attack. RRG 1.8 "Attack (Player Ability Type)" (p. 10): "If a triggered ability is
 * labeled as an attack … resolving that ability is considered to attack the specified target", "An ability labeled as
 * an attack is considered a single attack, even if that attack deals multiple instances of damage", "When an attack
 * targets multiple enemies, the attacking character is considered to have attacked each of those enemies" and "Each
 * attacked enemy with the retaliate X keyword that is still in play after the attack resolves deals its retaliate
 * damage to the attacking character". Owner ruling, 2026-10-07 (docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 Q47, following FFG's ruling
 * on the Cyclops ally, Q46): damage an "(attack)" ability deals to enemies while it resolves is damage from that
 * attack, even when separate instructions deal it or it goes to different enemies.
 *
 * An `attack` effect of an "(attack)" ability made by its controller's identity is still its own `attack` event frame,
 * with its "when … attacks" interrupt window and its damage. What changes is when it finishes:
 *
 * - **It waits for its ability.** Once its own damage has resolved, the frame reports its results to the instruction
 *   that made it (`<bind>.defeated`, `<bind>.excessDealt`, read by the ability's next instructions as before) and
 *   moves beneath the root effects frame of the ability (`attackOf`, `attackWaiting`), logged as
 *   `attackAwaitsAbility`. While it waits it is not "this attack" (`currentActivationFrameId`): the ability's other
 *   instructions name the activation around it, if any. It is again once it starts to finish (below).
 * - **Damage the ability then deals to an enemy is that attack's** (`abilityAttackDamage`): a `dealDamage` instruction
 *   of the same ability, to a card that is an enemy, is dealt by the attacker with the ability's card as `via`,
 *   `fromAttack`, and reported to the waiting frame (the attack's `damage`, `damaged`, `defeated` and `excessDealt`
 *   totals). So a rule on damage "from each attack" reads each instance ("increase the amount of damage that enemy
 *   takes from each attack by 1": every instance against that enemy), "prevent all damage from that attack" reaches
 *   every instance, and the attack's keywords (its attacker's or granted to it, `attackKeywordsOf`) are that damage's
 *   as they are the first instance's. Damage to anything else is not the attack's: the attacking identity ("take 1
 *   damage for each boost icon discarded this way"), an ally. Neither is damage another card deals meanwhile (a
 *   response to one of the instances), nor damage an instruction marked `fromAttack: false` deals.
 * - **Each such enemy is attacked, once.** The frame keeps one `characterAttacked` per enemy (`attacked`): its own
 *   target, then each enemy a later instruction dealt damage to.
 * - **The attack finishes after the ability's last effect**, when the root frame has left the stack and the waiting
 *   frame is on top again: `characterAttacked` for each enemy attacked (retaliate, from each one still in play, once
 *   however many instances it was dealt; RRG 1.8 p. 10 step 7), then the attack's own response window ("after …
 *   attacks [and defeats]", reading every instance's results), then its "at the end of this attack" effects, and
 *   effects lasting "for this attack" end.
 *
 * Unchanged: a basic attack, an attack by another character (an ally's), an attack an unlabeled ability makes, and an
 * "(attack)" ability's attack that was never made (no frame waits, so its later damage is plain damage).
 * An ability with several `attack` effects still makes one `attack` event each; each waits and finishes in order.
 * When each begins is below ("An ability with an `attack` effect begins its attack the same way").
 *
 * **A cancelled attack deals no damage** (owner decision, 2026-10-08, docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 row 65, rules check
 * A6: "cancelling a damage-only attack cancels its damage too"). No official text names the case. What the decision
 * rests on, RRG 1.8 "Cancel" (p. 11): "Cancel abilities interrupt the initiation of effects and prevent them from
 * resolving" and "Cancel effects are considered a subtype of replacement effect, with the canceled effect being
 * replaced with no effect. Abilities dependent on the canceled effect cannot trigger as the canceled effect is not
 * considered to have occurred"; "Attack (Player Ability Type)" (p. 10): "An ability labeled as an attack is considered
 * a single attack, even if that attack deals multiple instances of damage", so the instances of damage are the attack
 * that was cancelled. When an `attack` event of an "(attack)" ability by its controller's identity is cancelled (an
 * interrupt's `cancelTriggeringEvent` in its "when … attacks" window), the ability's root frame is marked
 * (`attackCancelled`, `cancelAbilityAttack`) and from then on:
 *
 * - **its damage instructions deal enemies nothing**: a `dealDamage` that would be the attack's
 *   (`isAttackInstruction`) and a division of damage skip every enemy, each logged as `attackTargetSkipped` with
 *   `reason: "attackCancelled"`, and a chosen-enemy instruction is offered no enemy. No enemy is attacked, nothing
 *   retaliates, and nothing answers "after … attacks" (the event's `cancelled` line, no response window);
 * - **its remaining `attack` effects are cancelled too** (the ability is one attack, p. 10): one not yet reached makes
 *   no event, and one whose event is already on the stack (the next enemy of "each enemy") is cancelled before its
 *   interrupt window;
 * - **post-"then" text does not resolve** when the text before it held a cancelled instruction (`preThenUnresolved`,
 *   cause `attackCancelled`; RRG 1.8 "'Then'", p. 44).
 *
 * Interpretations beyond that text, each with its alternative:
 *
 * - **The ability's other instructions still resolve**: a status given, a card drawn, damage its player takes, damage
 *   to a card that is not an enemy, an instruction the script keeps out of the attack (`fromAttack: false`). The
 *   attack was cancelled, not the ability, and this is what a cancelled "(thwart)" already does (`thwart-session.ts`:
 *   every instance of threat removal goes, the rest of the ability resolves). An instruction that reads the cancelled
 *   damage ("if that enemy was defeated", "for each damage dealt") finds nothing. (Alternative: the whole ability is
 *   cancelled except its costs, which is what RRG 1.8 "Labeled Ability", p. 26, says of a labeled ability cancelled
 *   by a status card: "the entire ability (except for its costs) is canceled". That sentence is about status cards
 *   only, so it was not extended here; reported to the owner.)
 * - **Damage already dealt stays dealt.** A label-only attack's window opens before its first instruction, so nothing
 *   precedes the cancel. In an ability with several `attack` effects an earlier one may have resolved: its damage
 *   stands, the enemies it attacked were attacked (they retaliate, and "after … attacks" answers that event when the
 *   ability finishes), and only what comes after the cancel is stopped. P. 11 prevents effects "from initiating"; it
 *   undoes nothing. (Alternative: the earlier attack's "after" abilities are silenced too; not built.)
 * - **A stunned identity is not this case**: its whole ability is cancelled by the status card first (p. 26,
 *   `labelCancels`), as before.
 *
 * **All damage of the attack prevented** (`modifyAttack.preventAllDamage` in a player attack's "when … attacks"
 * window: "Preparation: Prevent all damage from this attack"; docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.4, owner decision §4.1 Q4 = A:
 * with several targets, "this attack" is the whole attack). Official text: p. 10, "An ability labeled as an attack is
 * considered a single attack, even if that attack deals multiple instances of damage"; RRG 1.8 "Prevent" (p. 35). The
 * flag is on the `attack` event whose window it was set in, and every instance dealt with that frame as its parent
 * reads it: its own damage, and the damage of the ability's later instructions while it waits. When the ability makes
 * more than one `attack` event (one per enemy of "attack each enemy"), its root frame remembers the prevented one
 * (`attackDamagePrevented`, `preventAbilityAttackDamage`) and the damage of the others is prevented with it
 * (`attackPreventingDamage`). Unlike a cancelled attack, a prevented one still attacks: every enemy named is attacked
 * and retaliates, "after … attacks" answers, and its `damage` result is 0. This engine's interpretation, with its
 * alternatives:
 *
 * - **Damage already dealt stays dealt**: an enemy of "each enemy" whose own event resolved before the one the
 *   prevention was asked in. Prevention replaces damage that would be taken (p. 35); it heals nothing.
 *   (Alternative: nothing; the damage is on the character.)
 * - **Separate attacks of one ability are prevented together** (two `attack` instructions), as a cancel stops both
 *   (row 65). (Alternative: only the attack asked, which is how "that attack deals N additional damage" is read,
 *   Q53, on p. 10's "only increases the damage of one of that ability's attacks"; not built, since Q4 = A makes
 *   "this attack" the ability's whole attack.)
 * - **An attack with no `attackOf`** (an ally's, an unlabeled ability's, each share of a divided basic attack) is one
 *   event per enemy with nothing joining them, as everywhere else in this file: only the event asked is prevented.
 *
 * **Every "(attack)" ability is an attack** (owner ruling Q48, 2026-10-07; RRG 1.8 "Labeled Ability", p. 26: "When a
 * player resolves an ability labeled '(attack),' that ability is considered to be an attack made by that player's
 * identity"), whether or not it uses the hero's ATK or has an `attack` effect. An "(attack)" ability with no `attack`
 * effect anywhere in it (a *label-only* attack: "Hero Action (attack): Deal 3 damage to an enemy") makes one attack:
 * an `attack` event by that identity (`attack.labeled`) with its "when … attacks" interrupt window, which deals no
 * damage of its own and goes straight to waiting beneath the ability's root frame. Its damage instructions then
 * resolve, and their damage is that attack's, exactly as above. The root frame remembers the attack was made
 * (`labelAttackMade`), so there is one per resolution. An ability whose damage is only to its player's own characters
 * attacks nothing and makes no attack. Covered instructions: `dealDamage` and `divide` of damage; no shipped
 * "(attack)" ability uses another.
 *
 * **When a label-only attack begins.** Official rule, RRG 1.8 "Labeled Ability" (p. 26): "The identity of the player
 * using the labeled ability is considered to be performing the labeled effect when the labeled ability begins
 * resolving (after costs have been paid)." Owner decision, 2026-10-08 (docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 row 61, rules check
 * A1): the attack, and so its "when … attacks" window, opens as the ability begins resolving, before its first
 * instruction, not at its first damage instruction (`beginLabelAttack`). What follows is this engine's
 * interpretation of how that meets its instruction model, each point with the alternative it was chosen over:
 *
 * - **Target choices that open the ability are made first.** The engine asks an ability's "choose an enemy" as an
 *   instruction. RRG 1.8 "Target" (p. 42): "The phrase 'choose a [game element]' indicates that one or more targets
 *   must be selected in order for an ability to initiate", so a run of `chooseTarget` instructions at the start of
 *   the ability is read as part of initiating it, and the attack begins before the first instruction that is not one.
 *   That keeps "when [a character] attacks [this enemy / a confused enemy]" hearing the enemy the player chose.
 *   (Alternative: before the choice too, when no such interrupt could hear the attack.)
 * - **The attack's target as it begins** (`attack.targetInstanceId`, what its interrupt window reads) is the first
 *   enemy the identity may attack that the ability's first damage instruction able to name one names, read ahead as
 *   the attack begins: the chosen enemy, "the villain", the first of "each enemy". When no instruction can name one
 *   yet (its enemy is chosen after an earlier instruction resolves, or every enemy named is guarded) the attack
 *   begins with no target (`null`): an interrupt that asks nothing of the target hears it, one that names a target
 *   does not, and the event takes the first enemy an instruction attacks as its target then
 *   (`noteAttackedByAbility`). No later window opens for that enemy. (Alternative: a second window as each enemy is
 *   named; not built.)
 * - **Guard is not read as the attack begins**, only for each enemy as it would be attacked (Q49, below). An attack
 *   that begins and whose every enemy turns out to be guarded attacked nobody: it resolves with an empty
 *   `attack.attacked`, nothing retaliates, "after you attack" with no target clause answers it (the identity made an
 *   attack, p. 26) and "after you attack [an enemy]" does not. An ability whose attack names only enemies that cannot
 *   be attacked is refused before it is played, whatever else it does (`attackNamesNoAttackableEnemy` in
 *   `target-validity.ts`; RRG 1.8 "Target", p. 43: "A target that cannot be attacked is not a valid target for an
 *   attack-labeled ability"; owner decision, 2026-10-08, row 64). So this case is left to an ability whose enemies
 *   are not known as it is initiated (a branch, "each minion" with none in play) or become guarded as it resolves.
 * - **An attack is begun only by an ability that can attack an enemy.** It begins when one of the ability's damage
 *   instructions on the path it is about to resolve could name an enemy: its target is not known yet, or it names
 *   one now. An ability whose damage instructions name only its player's own characters makes no attack, as before.
 *   One whose damage instructions sit inside a branch not decided as it begins ("place a counter here; if there is a
 *   counter here, deal 2 damage to an enemy"), or reached with nothing resolving before them, makes its attack as the
 *   branch reaches the instruction (`openLabelAttack`), so a resolution that never takes the branch makes none, as
 *   before. What "decided as it begins" reads is stated with row 73 below (`attackAhead`), and since row 73 a damage
 *   instruction in a branch already decided, after another instruction, begins the attack with the ability.
 *   (Alternative: every "(attack)" ability attacks from its start whatever it then does, which p. 26 read alone
 *   supports; not adopted, to keep those two behaviors.)
 *
 * **An ability with an `attack` effect begins its attack the same way** (owner decision, 2026-10-08,
 * docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 row 73, rules check A1, second half: "Fix all affected older cards so the attack begins
 * when the ATK attack actually starts resolving. Keep attack timing consistent."). Official rule: the same sentence of
 * p. 26, which speaks of every labeled ability. When another instruction resolves before the ability's `attack`
 * instruction (a discard that sets the damage, a status given first, an enemy that attacks first), the attack begins
 * before that instruction, with its "when … attacks" window, and its damage is dealt when the `attack` instruction is
 * reached. The attack's beginning is split from its damage:
 *
 * - **It begins** (`beginLabelAttack`) as an `attack` event marked `begun`, by the identity, with amount 0. Its
 *   interrupt window resolves and it waits beneath the ability's root frame (`attackBegun`), exactly as a label-only
 *   attack does. A cancel in that window is the cancelled attack of row 65 (above): the instructions before the
 *   `attack` instruction still resolve, the `attack` instruction makes no attack.
 * - **The `attack` instruction takes it over** (`resumeBegunAttack`): the ability's first `attack` instruction by
 *   that identity gives the waiting event its target, amount, overkill and keywords and puts the same frame back on
 *   top of the stack at its damage step. No second event, no second window. What the window put on the frame is still
 *   there when the damage is computed: `modifyAttack`'s additional damage, ATK bonus and keywords, and effects
 *   lasting "for this attack". The attack then waits for the rest of its ability as before (Q47).
 * - **Damage instructions written before it are the attack's too** ("Deal 1 damage to each minion. Deal 8 damage to
 *   an enemy": one attack, RRG 1.8 p. 10), since the attack is waiting when they resolve: attack damage by the
 *   identity, each enemy named attacked, guard read for each, the attack's increase added to each instance (Q53).
 *   Before row 73 they were plain damage, dealt before the attack existed.
 *
 * Interpretations (not official text), each with its alternative:
 *
 * - **What is read ahead as the ability begins** (`attackAhead`). The engine follows the ability's instructions in
 *   order from its first one that is not an opening target choice, as far as their outcome is already decided: an
 *   `if` by its condition as it stands now ("if you paid for this card using a [physical] resource"), post-"then"
 *   text as resolving, a choice among options only when every option offered leads to an attack ("discard up to 4
 *   cards → deal …"). The attack begins with the ability when that path reaches an instruction that makes an attack
 *   (an `attack` instruction by the identity, or a damage instruction able to name an enemy) and something resolves
 *   before it. A branch not taken makes no attack, as before. An attack reached only through something not decided
 *   yet (a branch whose condition does not hold yet, a loop, one option of several) begins as its instruction is
 *   reached, as before. An attack whose own instruction is the first to resolve begins there, which is the same
 *   moment. (Alternatives: every "(attack)" ability attacks from its start whatever it then does, which p. 26 read
 *   alone supports, declined with row 61 to keep "a branch not taken makes no attack"; or never read into a branch,
 *   which leaves "Stun an enemy. If you paid with [physical], deal 3 damage to that enemy" beginning its attack after
 *   the stun.) The same reading now applies to a label-only attack: one whose damage sits in a branch already decided
 *   as the ability begins, after another instruction, begins with the ability instead of at that damage instruction.
 * - **What its window hears.** The target is read as for a label-only attack: the first enemy the identity may
 *   attack that an instruction of the attack names, taken in order (a damage instruction before the `attack`
 *   instruction first), or none (`null`) when it is chosen later. The keywords and overkill are the `attack`
 *   instruction's ("when you make a ranged attack" hears a ranged one). The amount is not known and reads 0.
 *   (Alternative: the amount as it would be if nothing more resolved first; not built, since a discard or a boost
 *   icon count would make it a guess.)
 * - **An `attack` instruction that names several enemies** ("each enemy") makes one event per enemy, as it always
 *   has. The begun attack is the first of them (the enemy its window heard, if that instruction still names it); the
 *   others are made as the instruction is reached, each with its own window. (Alternative: the other enemies' events
 *   skip their window and copy the first's modifiers; not built. No shipped ability with an instruction before such
 *   an `attack` exists.)
 * - **An ability that makes several separate attacks** (two `attack` instructions) still makes one attack per
 *   instruction. The first begins as the ability begins (through `beginLabelAttack` when something precedes it,
 *   otherwise at its own instruction, the same moment); each later one begins as its instruction is reached, with
 *   its own window. P. 26 has the identity attacking from the ability's start, which the first attack satisfies; p. 10
 *   ("An ability that increases the damage of an attack only increases the damage of one of that ability's attacks")
 *   has each attack hear "when you attack" on its own, and an attack that had begun before the one in front of it
 *   finished would have its window before that attack's damage and defeats. (Alternative: every attack of the
 *   ability begins at the start, in order; not built.)
 * - **A stun received while the ability resolves does not stop an attack that has begun.** RRG 1.8 "Stun, Stunned"
 *   (p. 41): "When this character would attack, remove each stunned status card from it instead" and "If a stunned
 *   identity or ally attempts to attack or use an attack ability, discard the stunned card instead." The attempt was
 *   made as the ability began, with no stunned card (a stunned identity's whole ability is cancelled then, p. 26,
 *   `labelCancels`), so the `attack` instruction that takes a begun attack over does not read the status again and
 *   the stunned card stays for the next attack. An attack that begins at its own instruction reads it there, as
 *   before. (Alternative: the instruction discards the stunned card and deals nothing, which is what happened before
 *   row 73 when "that enemy attacks you" stunned the hero before "deal 5 damage to that enemy".) This covers
 *   instructions of the effect only, not a cost (next point).
 * - **A printed cost written as effects is not part of the attack** (`AbilityDefinition.costEffects`; official: RRG
 *   1.8 "Initiating Abilities", p. 24, costs in step 5 and effects in step 6, p. 26's "after costs have been paid",
 *   and ruling April 30, 2026 - Ruling 2 on Return the Favor: "If a treachery revealed in Step 5 Stuns the hero, the
 *   Stun card is discarded in Step 6 instead of dealing damage"; owner decision 2026-10-16, audit finding 13, which
 *   supersedes reading the 2026-10-08 rule ahead of the cost). The ability begins resolving when the cursor reaches
 *   its first instruction after the cost (`beginEffectAfterCost` in `effects-frame.ts`, `effectBeganAt`): the status
 *   check of p. 26 is made there, so a stun gained while paying is discarded and cancels the effect, the cost staying
 *   paid, and only then does the attack begin. Nothing of the attack is read while the cost is paid.
 * - **An attack that began and whose instruction is never reached, or names no enemy it may attack by then**, is the
 *   label-only case above: it attacked the enemies its other damage instructions named, or nobody.
 *
 * **A target changed in the attack's window** (`EffectSpec retargetAttack` with `attack: "player"`: "when you attack an
 * enemy, change the target of this attack to a friendly character"; docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.66). Official text: RRG
 * 1.8 "Attack (Player Ability Type)" (p. 10), "resolving that ability is considered to attack the specified target",
 * and the card that changes the target. The invariant: once an attack event exists, its target as its window left it
 * is where that attack's damage goes, whichever instruction deals it. An `attack` instruction that makes its own
 * event has always done this (the event's apply step reads the event's target). For an attack whose damage is dealt
 * by instructions that resolve after its window (a label-only attack, a begun attack) the frame remembers the move
 * (`attackRetarget`: `from` the enemy the window heard, `to` the character it was moved onto), and what follows is
 * this engine's interpretation of the card, chosen to match the plain path:
 *
 * - **The attack on `from` is the attack on `to`.** Each instance of the attack's damage that an instruction aims at
 *   `from` is dealt to `to` instead, as attack damage by the identity with the attack's keywords and its increase
 *   (Q53), and `to` is the character attacked: it retaliates, `from` does not, and "after you attack [an enemy]" does
 *   not answer for it. Guard is read for `from` as the instruction resolves, as before: an instruction that may not
 *   attack `from` deals nothing, so nothing is moved. (Alternative: only the first instance moves; not built, since
 *   the card changes "the target of this attack", and the ability is one attack, p. 10.)
 * - **Moved onto an enemy, the attack is read as an attack on that enemy** (docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.4: "Preparation:
 *   Put this minion into play engaged with you. Resolve this attack against it instead", a guard minion; ruling
 *   January 17, 2026 - Ruling 2, of an attack event: "A.I.M. Grunt is now being attacked by Arm Block, taking the 3
 *   damage"). Whether the instruction may attack is then read for `to`, not `from` (`attackedInstead`): RRG 1.8
 *   "Guard" (p. 21) keeps a player from attacking the villain, and this attack is no longer against the villain, so
 *   the minion's own guard does not stop the attack made against it. A basic attack and a plain `attack`
 *   instruction already behave so: their event's apply step reads the event's target and no rule for the enemy it
 *   was moved off.
 * - **The `attack` instruction of a begun attack** takes the begun event over as its attack on `from` and deals its
 *   damage to `to` (`begunAttackTarget`). If it no longer names `from`, it takes it over as its attack on the first
 *   enemy it names, as it does with no retarget, and that enemy is dealt the damage: the move was off `from`.
 * - **The whole attack is moved** (owner decision, docs/phase7-wave9.md §4.1 Q4 = A, 2026-10-09, provisional: "this
 *   attack" in a Preparation is the whole attack, "all of it resolves against the one minion"; RRG 1.8 p. 10: "An
 *   ability labeled as an attack is considered a single attack"). Once the window of one of the ability's `attack`
 *   events moved it, `to` is the attack's only target (`retargetAbilityAttack`, kept on the ability's root frame as
 *   `attackRetargeted`): the damage aimed at `from` goes to `to` as above, and every other enemy the ability names
 *   afterward is not attacked and is dealt nothing (`skipRetargetedAway`, logged as `attackTargetSkipped` with
 *   `reason: "attackRetargeted"`), `to` included when an instruction names it on its own account ("the villain and
 *   each minion engaged with you", with `to` a minion now engaged: it takes the villain's share once). That covers a
 *   later damage instruction and the other events of an `attack` instruction that names several enemies (one event per
 *   enemy; `skippedWithRetargetedAttack`). Before the decision only the attack on `from` moved and the other enemies
 *   were attacked as written; to return to that (answer B), `retargetAbilityAttack` is the one place to change.
 *   Interpretations: **damage already dealt stays dealt** (an enemy of "each enemy" whose own event resolved before the
 *   one that was moved), as for a prevented attack; **a later `attack` instruction that names `from` again** makes its
 *   event against `from` as written, with its own window (no shipped card; not built); **an attack with no
 *   `attackOf`** (an ally's, an unlabeled ability's) is one event per enemy with nothing joining them, so only the
 *   event moved is.
 * - **An attack that began with no target** (`null`: its enemy is chosen later) has no target to move, so the
 *   retarget does nothing and logs nothing (`retargetAttack` requires a target), and the attack resolves as written.
 * - **`to` has left play** by the time an instruction would deal it damage: that instance is not dealt
 *   (`attackTargetSkipped` naming `to`), and `from` is not dealt it either.
 * - **Not built: a division of damage** (`divide`, `effects-frame.ts`). Its shares are assigned by the player after
 *   the window, among the enemies only, so a share given to `from` still goes to `from`, and the shares of the other
 *   enemies are dealt as assigned. No shipped card pairs the two; reported to the owner.
 *
 * **"That attack deals N additional damage" increases every instance** (owner ruling Q53, 2026-10-08; RRG 1.8 p. 10:
 * "When an attack ability has its damage increased by another ability, each instance of damage in that attack ability
 * that does not use the word 'additional' is increased by the specified amount"; "'For Each'", p. 20: "that modifier
 * is applied to each instance of the 'for each' effect"). `modifyAttack.extraDamage` is a var on the attack's own
 * frame: the attack's own damage adds it (`applyPlayerAttack`), and so does each later damage instruction of the
 * ability against an enemy (`abilityAttackDamage.extra`), for an attack with an `attack` effect and for a label-only
 * attack alike. Two limits:
 *
 * - **Not twice to additional damage.** An instruction the card words as additional damage of an earlier instance
 *   (`dealDamage.additional`) is a modification of that instance, not an instance (RRG 1.8 "Alteration Effect", p. 7;
 *   the Repulsor Blast FAQ), and gets no increase of its own.
 * - **One attack only.** The var belongs to the attack it was given to. In an ability that makes several attacks, an
 *   instruction's damage is the attack's made last before it (`waitingAbilityAttack`), and reads that attack's var:
 *   the other attacks of the ability, and their instances, get nothing (RRG 1.8 p. 10: "An ability that increases the
 *   damage of an attack only increases the damage of one of that ability's attacks").
 *
 * Damage that is not the attack's gets none of it: an instruction marked `fromAttack: false`, damage to the ability's
 * own player, damage to a card that is not an enemy.
 *
 * **A defeat instruction** ("Hero Action (attack): Defeat a non-Elite minion with an upgrade attached", Coup de Grâce,
 * `cw` 56016; docs/phase7-wave10-box-heroes.md B3.2) is read as a damage instruction is: p. 10, "resolving that ability
 * is considered to attack the specified target". An enemy an `EffectSpec defeat` of an "(attack)" ability names is
 * attacked by the identity (`characterAttacked`, with the attack's "when … attacks" window before it and "after …
 * attacks" after), guard is read for it, a cancelled attack defeats no enemy, and the defeat is the attack's: made by
 * the attacker (`characterDefeated.sourceInstanceId`, with the ability's card as `viaInstanceId`), marked `fromAttack`
 * and counted in the attack's `defeated` result, so "when you attack and defeat attached minion" answers it. A defeat
 * is not damage: an attack moved onto another character in its window does not move the defeat.
 *
 * **Guard restricts attack targeting, checked per enemy as it would be attacked** (owner ruling Q49; RRG 1.8 "Guard",
 * p. 21: "that player cannot use cards they control to attack a villain"; "Attack (Player Ability Type)", p. 10: "Hero
 * and ally attacks can target any enemy, unless a card ability (such as guard) is preventing that enemy from being
 * attacked"). Each damage instruction of the attack attacks the enemies it names, so each is read with `canAttack` as
 * that instruction resolves, not once for the ability:
 *
 * - an instruction that names its enemies ("each other enemy", "the villain") deals an enemy that cannot be attacked
 *   nothing and does not attack it, logged as `attackTargetSkipped`; its other enemies are dealt theirs;
 * - an instruction with a chosen enemy does not offer one that cannot be attacked (`attackTargetAllowed` in
 *   `target-validity.ts`, for a `chooseTarget` slot; a division's candidates), and with none to offer it does nothing;
 * - a guard minion an earlier instruction of the same ability defeated no longer guards: the villain can then be
 *   attacked by the next instruction.
 *
 * Guard is not read for damage that is not an attack on the enemy taking it: an overkill spill, an unlabeled
 * ability's damage, an instruction marked `fromAttack: false`.
 *
 * **Attacked is not damaged** (owner ruling Q50; RRG 1.8 p. 10: "When an attack targets multiple enemies, the attacking
 * character is considered to have attacked each of those enemies"). The frame's `attacked` list holds the enemies an
 * instruction targeted, and nothing else adds to it: an enemy that only took the attack's overkill spill is not
 * attacked, does not retaliate and satisfies no "after you attack …". When the attack finishes, its resolved event
 * carries the list (`attack.attacked`) and its targets are those enemies, so "after you attack a minion" matches a
 * minion only a later instruction named.
