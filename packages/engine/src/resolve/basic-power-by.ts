/**
 * `EffectSpec basicPowerBy` (docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.64): "that player makes a basic attack or thwart with a character
 * they control. That character gets +1 THW and +1 ATK for this use." (Cell Phone, `jubilee` 47019.)
 *
 * One effect step that needs up to three answers and then waits for the power to finish, so it runs as a small state
 * machine on the frame's own vars (`_power.step`), the way `playFromHand` does:
 *
 * 0. choose the character and the power;
 * 1. choose the target, or several for a character who may divide the power;
 * 4. (several targets only) divide the power among them;
 * 2. pay the power's own additional cost, if it has one (the cards a "discard N cards from your hand" part is paid
 *    with, then its resources), then declare the power;
 * 3. (after everything the power pushed has resolved) end a bonus the power never started.
 *
 * The power itself is the ordinary command (`basicAttack` / `basicThwart` with `BasicPowerBy.instructed`), declared
 * from here with this effects frame beneath it: nothing about how a basic power resolves is restated.
 *
 * **A divided basic power** (owner decision, 2026-10-08, docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 row 82): a character who may
 * divide its basic power (`RuleSpec divideBasicPower`: "Wasp may divide her basic attack among any number of
 * enemies") may divide it when a card has them make it. The card says "makes a basic attack or thwart", and RRG 1.8
 * FAQ "Wasp (#1C)" (p. 61) treats her divided attack as her basic attack; no official source speaks of a basic power
 * made on a card's instruction. The command carries the division (`divide`) and checks it as it checks the player's
 * own: distinct legal targets, shares of at least 1 that total the stat for this use, the +1 included
 * (`dividedBasicPowerValue`). A thwart made with ATK by the player's choice is not divided, as on their own turn.
