/**
 * Simultaneous damage (RRG 1.8 "Indirect Damage", p. 24: "All indirect damage from a single source is first assigned
 * and then resolved simultaneously"). A `damageGroup` frame runs three stages over its members:
 *
 * 1. each member's interrupt window, as a real `dealDamage` event frame, so "prevent N of that damage" and "cannot take
 *    damage" work on each instance (ruling, Aug 3, 2026 (2) answer 1: a reduction applies to indirect damage assigned
 *    to that character);
 * 2. every member's damage, then one defeat sweep, so no instance is resolved before another is dealt;
 * 3. each member's response window, with its results, so every response sees every instance already dealt.
