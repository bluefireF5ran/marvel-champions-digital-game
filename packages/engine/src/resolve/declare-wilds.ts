/**
 * The player declares the wilds of the payment just made for this card or this ability (docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.62,
 * §4.1 Q33 = B; RRG 1.8 "Wild Resource", p. 48). Asked by the frame the payment paid for: a play's own frame, so the
 * command, a timing window's payment and an effect's payment all reach it, or an ability's frame, for an action
 * (`useAbility`) and for an interrupt or response paid inside a window. It is asked before the card enters play or
 * the ability resolves anything, so every reader of the payment reads the declaration. The frame is below the
 * payment's own announcements (`announceResourcesSpent`), which do not read a wild's type: a wild is only a wild
 * outside the cost it pays (p. 48).
 *
 * Answered, the paid resources are the ones that give the most declared types (`paidSetsAsDeclared`; §4.1 Q34 = A and
 * its follow-up), recorded as `paid.as.<type>` and logged. `resolveChoice` has already refused an illegal declaration;
 * one that is illegal here all the same is asked again.
 *
 * **Which resources were paid** (owner decision, 2026-10-08, §4.1 row 79; RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 13, says overpaid
 * resources "were not paid" without saying which they are). When several sets give as many types and the payment's
 * readers (`UndeclaredWilds.reads`) read them differently, the player chooses the set in a second choice
 * (`choosePaidResources`), asked by this same frame once the wilds are declared (`UndeclaredWilds.declared`, which is
 * all a payment with no wild, or with its wilds declared on the command, waits here for). When every set reads the
 * same the first is taken and nobody is asked.
