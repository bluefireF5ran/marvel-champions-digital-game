/**
 * RRG "Defeat": an ally or minion with damage equal to its hit points is
 * defeated and discarded (attachments with it). Runs after the defeat's
 * interrupt window, so a "would be defeated … instead" effect that healed it
 * means nothing happens. Overkill excess is dealt only if the defeat happens.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "When Defeated Abilities" (p. 48): "A defeated card leaves play after its 'When Defeated' ability is resolved,
 * if any." So the defeat happens here (logged, reported to the attack) but the card stays in play while its own When
 * Defeated abilities resolve, then leaves (`leaveAfterWhenDefeated`).
 *
 * Any overkill spill is dealt as soon as the defeat has happened, before those When Defeated abilities (`applyDefeat`,
 * `defeatedTogether`): "Overkill damage is simultaneous with the damage from the attack, so the 'Forced Interrupt' on
 * M.O.D.O.K. resolves first because it uses the word 'would.' Then, the 'When Defeated' ability of the Adaptoid
 * resolves" (MC50 rulebook FAQ, p. 22, on RRG 1.8 "Overkill", p. 31, and "Damage", p. 14: placing damage is step 5,
 * "would be defeated" step 6, When Defeated step 7). The spill is still dealt only "if a minion is defeated by an
 * attack with the overkill keyword" (p. 31), so it waits for this defeat's own interrupt window and no longer; its
 * amount was fixed by the damage that caused the defeat (`applyDamage`). Before 2026-10-10 it was dealt after the
 * defeated card left play.
 * A side scheme already worked this way (ruling, Jan 11, 2026 (1); `applySchemeDefeated`). Before 2026-09-25 an ally
 * or minion was discarded before its When Defeated resolved (docs/phase7-wave3.md §4 Q4).
 *
 * Returns false when the defeat does not happen, true when it did and nothing is left to do (a villain stage, an
 * identity), and for an ally or minion what its When Defeated and leaving steps need, which the caller schedules
 * (`applyDefeat` alone, `defeatedTogether` for several at once).

 * The excess of the damage one `dealDamage` event **dealt**, where `excessDamageOf` measures the damage **taken**: the
 * amount dealt (`dealDamage.dealt`) beyond the target's remaining hit points. A second value beside `excessDealt`,
 * never a replacement for it: overkill, excess placed as threat, a defeat's `excessDamage` and every ability that
 * counts "excess damage" read the damage taken (RRG 1.8 "Overkill", p. 31; owner decision 2026-09-25). This one is read
 * only by an ability the owner has ruled counts the damage dealt (owner answer 31B, 2026-10-12, docs/phase7-wave10.md
 * §4.0: "heal 1 damage … for each point of excess damage dealt to that enemy by that attack").
 *
 * February 8, 2026 - Ruling 2: 6 dealt to a minion with 3 hit points that takes 1 less from each attack is "excess
 * dealt: 6 - 3 = 3" and "excess taken: 5 - 3 = 2". RRG 1.8 "Excess Damage" (p. 19): "any amount of damage that is
 * dealt to a character beyond that character's remaining hit points". "Damage" (p. 14): "When the amount of damage an
 * effect deals is modified, the amount of damage the character takes is similarly modified. When the amount of damage a
 * character takes is modified (such as by damage being prevented), the amount of damage dealt is not modified."
 *
 * What "dealt" is here is what `dealDamage.dealt` already is for "after X deals damage" (owner ruling 2026-10-07,
 * docs/dealt-vs-taken-audit.md): the amount as it reached the damage-dealing process, after anything that changed what
 * the effect deals (DEF, an ATK modifier, "increase that damage"), before anything that changes what the target takes.
 * The ruling covers only the first line below; the rest follow p. 14's sentence and "Prevent" (p. 35: "the amount of
 * damage that character 'takes' is reduced, but the amount of damage 'dealt' is not reduced"), and ruling January 26,
 * 2026 (3): "Excess damage can be dealt even if the target does not take that damage."
 *
 * - **A constant reduction or a cap on damage taken** ("takes 1 less", "cannot take more than N"): not subtracted.
 * - **A tough status card**: it prevents the damage (RRG 1.8 "Tough", p. 44), so the damage was dealt in full and
 *   its excess is counted, though nothing was taken and nothing spills.
 * - **"Cannot take damage"** and **"prevent all damage"** rules: the same; dealt, not taken.
 * - **A "prevent N of that damage" interrupt, or a "reduce that damage to N" one**: the same (`dealt` keeps the
 *   amount from before the interrupt), down to a full prevention.
 * - **A constant that raises or doubles the damage taken** ("takes +1 damage", "double the damage this minion
 *   takes"): not added either, by the same sentence, so here this value is *lower* than the excess taken.
 * - **Damage of 0 as it would be dealt** (a defense that covers the attack): nothing was dealt, no excess.
 * - **No modifier of damage taken at all**: equal to `excessDamageOf`.
 *
 * `excessDamageBonus` ("When your hero's attack deals any amount of excess damage, increase that amount by 1", Follow
 * Through) answers either excess (owner answer 42B, 2026-10-12; before it, answer A kept it on the excess taken
 * alone). Its condition is "any amount of excess damage", and there are two measures of that amount, so each is
 * raised exactly when it is itself above 0:
 * - this value, whenever the damage dealt has excess, whether or not any was taken (4 dealt to a 3-hit-point minion
 *   that takes 1 less: 1 becomes 2; 6 dealt into a tough status card: 3 becomes 4);
 * - `excessDamageOf`, as before, whenever the damage taken has excess.
 * A measure at 0 is not "any amount" and stays 0: the bonus never makes excess taken out of excess dealt, so with only
 * the damage dealt in excess nothing spills by overkill and no ability counting the excess taken counts anything (RRG
 * 1.8 "Overkill", p. 31: the spill is the "damage on that [character] beyond its hit points"; the card raises an
 * amount of excess, it deals no damage of its own). Nor the reverse: 3 dealt to a minion that takes 1 more is 1
 * excess taken, raised to 2, and still no excess dealt (answer 40A).

 * One enemy attacks another (`EffectSpec enemyAttacksEnemy`; docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.23, §4 Q12 as the user decided it
 * on 2026-09-23): an attack, not an activation, so there is no boost step and no defense step — the target is an enemy,
 * with no controller to defend it. What is left of RRG 1.8 "Attack (Enemy Activation)" (p. 9) is steps 4–6: the
 * attacker's ATK (modifiers included) is dealt to the target as attack damage, and the attack finishes with the
 * `characterAttacked` event that retaliate hangs off. The damage is the same `dealDamage` a player's attack pushes, so
 * the target's tough status, its damage reductions, piercing, and overkill (RRG 1.8 "Overkill", p. 31: a defeated
 * minion's excess goes to the villain, whoever attacked it) all apply exactly as they do anywhere else.
 *
 * Re-checked here because the interrupt window may have changed things: an attacker or target that left play ends the
 * attack (RRG 1.8 "Activation", p. 6's rule for a minion leaving mid-activation, applied to this attack), and so does a
 * `cannotAttack` rule now in force. Guard never does (`canAttack`: an enemy's attack is nobody's; RRG 1.8 "Guard", p. 21).
