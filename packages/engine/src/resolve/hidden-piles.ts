/**
 * Hidden piles (`GameState.hiddenPiles`, docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.29 (a)): cards no player may look at, kept by card id
 * outside every zone, and the cards that have come out of them faceup (`GameState.revealedPileCards`).
 *
 * The Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. evidence envelopes. MC50 p. 5, "Preparing the Evidence": "1. Separate the nine evidence
 * cards (185–193) by their card backs into three sets of three cards. 2. Shuffle each set of three cards separately and
 * put one card from each set into the A.I.M. envelope **without looking at them**. 3. Shuffle the six remaining evidence
 * cards together and put them in the S.H.I.E.L.D. envelope **without looking at them**." MC50 p. 18: a standalone Baron
 * Zemo game follows those steps at setup, and "When the players gain an evidence card, they turn it faceup". MC50 p. 19,
 * "The Accusation": "the players take the evidence cards from the A.I.M. envelope".
 *
 * Three moves, each logged, none naming a card by title:
 * - `dealHiddenPiles` puts the piles together at random (`EffectSpec dealHiddenPiles`);
 * - `gainFromHiddenPile` turns some of a pile's cards faceup at random (`EffectSpec gainFromHiddenPile`);
 * - `revealHiddenPile` turns a whole pile faceup (`EffectSpec revealHiddenPile`, and the accusation of §3.29 (b)).
 *
 * Every random step is a draw on the game's seeded RNG (`GameState.rng`), as a deck shuffle is, so a replay of the
 * command log deals and gains the same cards.
 *
 * **One writer.** `placeHiddenPiles` is the only code that writes either field. A game whose envelopes come from
 * outside it (campaign mode, where they were filled when the campaign began and some cards were gained in earlier
 * scenarios) places them through the same function, before the scenario's own "prepare the evidence" resolves, which
 * then deals nothing (`GameEvent hiddenPilesDealt.kept`).
