/**
 * Which side of a main scheme stage is faceup (docs/phase7-wave8.md §4.1 Q56).
 *
 * RRG 1.8 Appendix II step 12 (p. 51): "a. Resolve any 'Setup' abilities on main scheme card 1A. b. Flip the main
 * scheme card to side 1B and resolve any 'When Revealed' abilities on that side." RRG 1.8 "Main Scheme" (p. 27), when
 * the main scheme deck advances: "2. Resolve any 'When Revealed' ability on the 'A' side of the new top card … 3. Flip
 * the top card of the main scheme deck to its 'B' side, place threat on that card equal to its starting threat value,
 * and resolve any 'When Revealed' ability on that side of the card."
 *
 * So a stage begins with its A side faceup (`MainSchemeState.faceupSide`), and its B side's abilities are not live
 * until the stage turns over: nothing printed on the B side answers what the A side's instructions do (or what step
 * 11 of setup puts into play), and an ability that becomes live when the stage turns does not trigger for something
 * that happened before. The turn is its own event on the stack, `mainSchemeTurnsToB`, behind the A side's frames; its
 * apply step turns the stage and only then puts the B side's own Setup and When Revealed frames on the stack.
 *
 * **Hinder on a stage** (docs/phase7-wave10.md §3.13). RRG 1.8 "Hinder X" (p. 22): "A card with the hinder X keyword
 * enters play with X threat on it", "in addition to any threat it normally enters play with"; MC56 p. 9: "When a card
 * with hinder X enters play, place X threat on that card." A stage's keywords are its B side's, printed or gained from
 * its own text ("If there is more than 1 player on your team, this stage gains hinder 2[per_hero]", the Civil War
 * stage 1B cards), so they are read once that side is the faceup one: the turn places `keywordTotal(hinder)` as one
 * placement, before the B side's Setup and When Revealed resolve. The stage's starting threat is its own placement
 * (at setup it is already on the stage; on an advance it follows on the stack), so the stage ends with both. Read
 * once, as the stage turns: a stage that gains hinder later, or loses it, has no threat placed or removed for it.
