/**
 * Flipping a card whose other face is emitted as a card of its own (`BaseCard.otherFaceId`, docs/phase7-wave4.md §1.7,
 * §3.10): Secure the Landing Pad → Cosmo (an ally), Save the Shawarma Place → Black Swan (a minion), Open the Dungeons →
 * Jormungand (an attachment), Hack Sanctuary's Computer → Defensive Protocols (a side scheme), `mts` 21180–21189.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Flip" (p. 20): "if the new faceup side of that card has … a different card type from the previous face, all
 * attached cards, tucked cards, status cards, and tokens are discarded from the card"; the same type keeps them. The
 * card never leaves play. On another type it goes where its new type lives, as a revealed card of that type would
 * (`enterPlayOnReveal`): a minion engaged with `playerId`, an ally or other player-type card under `playerId`'s control,
 * an attachment on its first legal host (none: it leaves play, and a double-sided card leaving play is removed from the
 * game), a scheme or environment in the villain's area. A card in an in-play scenario area (`scenarioPlayArea`,
 * docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.33, §3.40) stays in that area, under no player's control, whatever its new type. Either way the new face is then treated as entering play: a
 * side scheme gets its starting threat and hinder, a minion engages, "enters play" triggers fire. The RRG does not say
 * a flip enters play; the printed faces assume it (Defensive Protocols' "Hinder 2"). docs/phase7-wave4.md §4 Q17 (user decision 2026-09-24).
 *
 * `reveal` ("flip this card and reveal [its other face]", `flipCard.reveal`; docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.34): the new face
 * is also revealed where it is (`revealNewFaceFrame`), after it has entered play as above, so a side scheme face holds
 * the threat the card kept plus its starting threat when its When Revealed resolves (§4.1 Q19). The flip then pushes
 * the `cardFlipped` event itself, under the reveal, and the caller pushes none.
 *
 * `keepCounters` (`flipCard.keepCounters`; docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.26, §4.1 Q1 = A): the counter types the card keeps
 * through a change of type, where the Flip rule above would discard them with every other token. A product's own rules
 * can count on them staying (a Board Member environment that flips to an attachment on the villain holds its secret
 * counters, MC50 pp. 11 and 19), and the card data names which; RRG 1.8 "The Golden Rules" (p. 4). Nothing else the
 * rule discards is kept, and the counters are not placed again (no `countersPlaced`).
