/**
 * Rearranging looked-at cards among the positions they hold (`EffectSpec lookAt` with `rearrange`;
 * docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.12): "look at each encounter card dealt to each player and the top card of the encounter
 * deck. You may swap any number of those cards." Any number of swaps among the same cards is one arrangement of them
 * over the same positions (RRG 1.8 "'Swap'", p. 42: each card takes the place of the other).
 *
 * Every position keeps a card, so every player keeps the number of facedown encounter cards they were dealt, in the
 * same places of their queue (RRG 1.8 "Deal, Deal an Encounter Card", p. 15), no deck gains or loses a card, and an
 * enemy keeps the number of facedown boost cards it was given, in the order they will be turned up
 * (docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.44). A card that takes a boost card's place is that boost card: facedown there, turned up
 * and resolved by the activation, with no "given a boost card" of its own. The card that leaves it for the top of a
 * deck is facedown there, or showing when a rule keeps that top faceup (`RuleSpec topOfDeckFaceup`, §3.42): "swapped
 * cards maintain the orientation … of the original card" (RRG 1.8 "'Swap'", p. 42).
 * Nothing is revealed, turned faceup or shuffled, and nothing is dealt: a card that comes to a player this way was
 * not "dealt" to them by this effect, so no "after a player is dealt an encounter card" hears it.
