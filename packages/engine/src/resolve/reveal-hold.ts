/**
 * What waits for the end of a reveal: every response window, and toughness, triggered while an encounter card is
 * being revealed.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Reveal" (p. 38): "Responses (both forced and non-forced) to any step of the revealing of an encounter card
 * are not resolved until after all steps of the reveal process have been completed." The owner's decision of
 * 2026-10-16 (rules audit finding 18) reads it as written: the responses to anything that happens while the reveal
 * resolves wait, whatever the occurrence (threat placed by incite or a When Revealed, a card entering play, damage,
 * status cards, cards drawn or discarded). This replaces the narrower holds of the owner's answers 32B and 35B
 * (2026-10-12), which held only the responses to the revealed card entering play.
 *
 * How. `pushWindow` hands every response window it is asked to open to the reveal in progress (`holdingReveal`)
 * instead of pushing it: the window's conditions are appended to `Frame<"reveal">.heldResponses`, and the reveal opens
 * them all in one window at its end, with "after this card is revealed" (`announceRevealFinished`, answer 39A's first
 * window; forced responses resolve first there, RRG 1.8 "Simultaneous Timing Priority", p. 5). Interrupts are never
 * held: they resolve as their occurrence would (RRG 1.8 "Interrupt", p. 25). Lasting "each time …" effects are not
 * Response abilities and resolve where they always did.
 *
 * Toughness is a forced response too (RRG 1.8 "Toughness", p. 45: "Forced Response: After this character enters play,
 * give it a tough status card"), so a character entering play while a reveal resolves gets its tough status card
 * once the reveal's steps are done (`Frame<"reveal">.heldToughness`). This supersedes the owner's answer 33A
 * (2026-10-12), which kept the tough card as the minion entered play, under the order of rules authority of CLAUDE.md
 * (the latest RRG first). A card put into play with no reveal in progress is unchanged (answer 38A).
