 * (the owner's answer to open point 3 of docs/phase7-wave10-q30-impact.md = A): the minion must still be in play, so
 * a When Revealed that removed it from play leaves nothing to resolve, and a keyword it gained or lost while its When
 * Revealed resolved is read as it stands. An enemy that "cannot activate" is stopped where every activation is, as
 * its event initiates (`executeEventFrame`).
 *
 * The two keywords part ways when the When Revealed moved the minion to another player (the owner's answers 36B and
 * 37A, 2026-10-12):
 * - Quickstrike answers one engagement: "After a minion with the quickstrike keyword engages a player whose identity
 *   is in hero form, that minion attacks that player" (RRG 1.8 p. 36). The reveal's engagement was with
 *   `engagedPlayerId`; a minion no longer engaged with that player has nothing left to answer here, and its new
 *   engagement had its own quickstrike where it was made (`engagedInPlayFrames`).
 * - Teamwork names no engagement, only where the minion stands as it resolves: "the minion that just entered play
 *   activates against the player it is engaged with" (RRG 1.8 "Teamwork (Trait)", p. 43). So it still resolves, against
 *   whichever player the minion is engaged with now (`teamworkActivation` reads `engagedWith` as it resolves), and
 *   not at all when it is engaged with nobody. It needs the minion to have entered play engaged by this reveal
 *   (`engagedPlayerId`) and not to have been found in play (`foundInPlay`, p. 19: "not considered to be entering

     * `specificTo: { kind: "scenario" }` support nobody's deck ever holds). It needs a play area to sit in like any
     * other card; `playerId` is only its initial home; `RuleSpec controlledByFirstPlayer` (already declared by its
     * own constant ability) reassigns control on the very next state-trigger sweep if that isn't the first player.
     * An ownerless ally or upgrade is the same case: MC21's campaign puts Cosmo (21180b) and Odin (21139a) "into play
     * under the first player's control" (MC21 p. 17, p. 25) from the set-aside cards, where nobody owns them.
     *
     * The player it enters play under also becomes its owner, as `takeIntoHand` does: RRG 1.8 "Ownership and
     * Control" (p. 31), "When a player takes control of a campaign-specific or scenario-specific player card …, that
     * player becomes the owner of that card until the game ends or another player takes control of that card." So it
     * leaves play to that player's discard pile, not the encounter discard pile. MC27's Venom (190), Helicarrier and
     * Symbiote Suit, brought in from outside the game by a campaign (`CampaignOp` `setAsideCards`), read the same way.
     *
     * A card with an encounter back (`BaseCard.cardBack`: Longshot, `mojo` 39071, revealed from the encounter deck)
     * changes control only: the same rule's "with a player card back" leaves the scenario its owner, so it keeps its
     * encounter home and leaves play to the encounter discard pile, from where it can be revealed again
     * (docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.71, §4 Q41). A campaign that makes such a card a player's for the game gives it an owner
     * before it gets here (`moveCards.assignOwnerTo`, §4 Q14), and an owned card keeps its owner.
