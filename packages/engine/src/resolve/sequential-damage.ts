/**
 * `EffectSpec assignDamage` with `sequential` (docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.37): a pool of damage dealt to one character at
 * a time, each settled before the next is chosen.
 *
 * MC45 p. 6, step 4 of a mission attempt: "Deal damage from this pool to enemies at the mission one at a time until
 * there is no damage in the pool or there are no enemies remaining at the mission." RRG 1.8 "Damage" (p. 14), "Defeat"
 * (p. 15). The chooser picks a character that can take damage and how much of the pool it is dealt, from 1 to its
 * remaining hit points; that damage resolves as one damage event, with any defeat, When Defeated and Victory it
 * causes, before the next pick. So a character that could not take damage while another stood ("cannot take damage
 * while another minion is at the mission") is offered once that one has fallen. What is left when nobody can take
 * damage is lost. The damage is the ability's, not an attack: no attacker, retaliate or overkill.
 *
 * The amount is the player's because a pick is one instance of damage (RRG 1.8 "Tough", p. 45: a tough status card
 * prevents "any amount of damage" once), so 1 damage to remove a tough status card and the rest afterward is a
 * different result from all of it at once.
