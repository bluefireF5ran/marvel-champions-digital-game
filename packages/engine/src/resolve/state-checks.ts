/**
 * Condition-triggered forced abilities (`AbilityTriggerSpec` `stateCheck`): "If there are no madness counters here,
 * flip Green Goblin and State of Madness." (docs/phase7-wave1.md §3.4).
 *
 * `runFlow` calls `checkStateTriggers` between every two frames, the way RRG 1.8 "Uses" (p. 46) discards a card the
 * moment its last counter goes, so the ability resolves before anything else continues (FAQ "Green Goblin (#1B)",
 * p. 59: the flip happens in the middle of an attack). The last observed value of each condition lives in
 * `GameState.stateChecks`, so the check is plain state: a replay re-derives it and a save carries it.
 *
 * A check is edge-triggered. One marked `fromEntering` (a standing "If …, discard this card") also resolves the first
 * time it is seen with its condition true, which for a card entering play is the moment it is in play: before any
 * interrupt or response to its entering play, and before anything else resolves (`pendingEntry`).

 *
 * An edge, not a level: the hit points of each damaged character are remembered (`GameState.hitPointsSeen`) and the
 * sweep runs only when one that was above the damage on it is seen at or below it. So a character deliberately left
 * at zero is not defeated again by standing there: one a "cannot be defeated" rule or a hit point floor holds
 * (`heldAtZero`, released by `checkDefeatProtectionEnded` alone), one whose defeat was replaced, and one whose damage
 * was just dealt and whose own sweep, carrying who dealt it, is a frame away. The first sight of a character only
 * records. The sweep carries no damage, so the defeat has no defeating player and no defeating card, as a protection
 * ending has none (docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1 Q21). Returns true when it put a defeat on the stack or ended the game.

 * their remaining hit points", damage is applied "by reducing that character's hit point dial by the specified
 * amount", and a "+X hit points" that ends reduces the dial by X. A dial has no reading below zero, so an identity or
 * villain that is still in play past zero (it "cannot be defeated", it is "considered to have at least 1 hit point",
 * or its defeat was replaced by something that did not set the dial) keeps damage equal to its maximum hit points and
 * no more: healing 4 then leaves 4 remaining, not 4 less whatever went past zero.
 *
 * Settled here, between frames, and never while the character's defeat is on the stack: the damage itself is applied
 * and read in full first (the log's `damageDealt`, a damage event's `amount`, the excess of RRG 1.8 "Overkill",
 * p. 31, and the defeat sweep all read the amount taken), and a defeat's own windows see the card as the damage left
 * it. A villain stage that falls starts the next at full hit points, and a defeated villain or an eliminated player is
 * out of the game, so only a character that stays is touched.
 *
 * An ally or minion is left alone: its damage is tokens, placed in "the specified value" (RRG 1.8 "Damage", p. 14)
 * and counted past its hit points ("zero or fewer remaining hit points", p. 22; "any damage on that ally beyond its
