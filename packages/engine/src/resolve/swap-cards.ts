/**
 * Swapping two arbitrary cards (`EffectSpec swapCards`, docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.47): Weather Control and Weather Goddess
 * (`storm` 36001a, 36009) swap Storm's WEATHER support in play with one from her facedown WEATHER deck.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "'Swap'" (p. 42): the two components exchange locations; "a swap cannot be completed if there is not a
 * component in both locations"; "swapped cards maintain the orientation (such as ready or exhausted, faceup or facedown)
 * of the original card"; between a play area and an out-of-play area, cards that
 * - share a title: "neither card is considered to enter or leave play", everything on the in-play card is transferred
 *   to the other and it keeps the in-play card's state. Built as `swapVillain` builds Loki's swap: the in-play instance
 *   stays where it is with all its state (and every lasting effect, attachment or frame naming it) and takes the other
 *   card, which the out-of-play instance takes in exchange;
 * - do not share a title: "the in-play card is considered to leave play and the out-of-play card is considered to enter
 *   play", nothing transfers and "the other card enters play ready". The outgoing card leaves through `leavePlay` (its
 *   attachments discarded, its state cleared, "when it leaves play" interrupts first, Permanent's same-set exception
 *   read against the swapping ability's card, RRG 1.8 "Permanent", p. 32), into the other card's exact place with the
 *   other card's orientation; the incoming card takes the outgoing card's place, faceup if it was, under its controller,
 *   and its `cardEntersPlay` is announced (the enter-play keywords are that event's apply step).
 * Two out-of-play cards (Eidetic Memory, `silk`, erratum RRG 1.8 p. 70) just exchange places and orientations: a
 * facedown boost card on an enemy and the top card of the encounter deck among them (Up, Up, and Away, `falcon` 53005;
 * docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.44), where the card swapped in is the boost card the activation turns up
 * (`boostCardReplaced`) and the one swapped out is the deck's top card, facedown unless a rule shows it. A card
 * swapped out of a reveal in progress is still that reveal's card: ending it is `revealCard.instead`
 * (docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.41).
 *
 * A facedown card attached to a card in play is out of play (RRG 1.8 "In Play and Out of Play", p. 23:
 * `isFacedownAttachment`), so swapping it with a card in play is the play-area / out-of-play-area swap above: the
 * in-play card leaves play and becomes the facedown attachment ("swapped cards maintain the orientation ... faceup or
 * facedown ... of the original card": facedown, with no title or text there), and the facedown one enters play faceup,
 * ready, in the other's place.
 *
 * Not built (refused, logged `swapRefused`): two cards both in play (no printed card does it), and identities, villains
 * and main schemes, which have their own swaps (`swapIdentity`, `swapVillain`).
