/**
 * Target validity: RRG 1.8 "Target" (pp. 42–43). "A target is valid for an ability or game function if any part of
 * that ability can affect that target", and "If an ability or game function has multiple effects on its target, the
 * target is valid if at least one of those effects can affect the target." In particular "A target that cannot be
 * thwarted is not a valid target for a thwart-labeled ability" (so the main scheme, for a player a patrol minion is
 * engaged with; RRG 1.8 "Patrol", p. 32), and a character that cannot take damage is not a valid target for an ability
 * whose only effect on it is dealing damage (ruling, Apr 30, 2026 (1)), an attack's damage included (`attackCanDamage`;
 * ruling Mar 19, 2026 (2) for a basic attack, which `basicAttack` in `actions.ts` refuses by the same reading).
 *
 * One place judges it, read three ways (docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.5, §4 Q5):
 *
 * - **at initiation** (`abilityLacksValidTarget`): a player ability whose opening required choice has no valid
 *   candidate, and nothing else of its own to do, cannot be initiated (RRG 1.8 "Initiating Abilities", p. 24, step 2;
 *   "Choose (Game Element)", p. 12), so `playCard`/`useAbility` refuse it with `no_valid_target`, `legalActions` does
 *   not offer it, and a window does not offer an optional interrupt/response;
 * - **at the choice** (`requestTargetChoice` in `effects-frame.ts`): only valid targets are offered;
 * - **"up to" divisions** (`divisionCanAffect`), through the same per-effect checks.
 *
 * The resolution-time check stays as the backstop: a target can become invalid between the choice and the effect
 * (a patrol minion engaging in between, the analogue of ruling Apr 30, 2026 (2)), and `threatRemovalBlocked` then
 * stops the removal as it applies.
 *
 * A move of threat is judged by its source (`canMoveThreatFrom`, `moveThreatLacksSource`): RRG 1.8 "Move" (p. 30), "If
 * there is no valid source or destination for a move, the move cannot be made", and threat moved off a scheme is
 * removed from it, so a scheme its threat cannot be removed from is no source (owner ruling 2026-10-06,
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1).
 *
 * "A target that cannot be attacked is not a valid target for an attack-labeled ability" (p. 43): an "(attack)" ability
 * whose attack names no enemy its player may attack cannot be initiated, whatever else it does
 * (`attackNamesNoAttackableEnemy`; owner decision, 2026-10-08), as a "(thwart)" ability with no scheme to thwart cannot
 * (`thwartNamesNoValidScheme`).
 *
 * **A scheme with no threat is no target for a removal of threat** (`holdsThreat`; rules QA finding F1,
 * docs/phase7-wave10-qa-players.md): "A target is valid for an ability or game function if any part of that ability can
 * affect that target" (p. 42), "removing threat" being one of the listed effects on a target, and the same page's
 * exception names the valid target of a basic thwart as "a scheme with threat on it" ("Thwart", p. 44: "A character can
 * only initiate a basic thwart if there is a scheme with at least one threat for the character to remove or if that
 * character is confused"). So `removeThreat` and `thwart` cannot affect a scheme holding none, a division of threat
 * offers only schemes holding some, and an ability whose every part is such a removal ("Hero Action (thwart): Remove 3
 * threat from a scheme", "Exhaust → remove 1 threat from a scheme", the same with "If this removes the last threat …"
 * after it) cannot be initiated while no scheme holds threat. An ability with another part of its own ("Remove 2
 * threat from a scheme and deal 1 damage to an enemy") still can: it has a valid target, and its removal finds nothing
 * to choose as it resolves (`hasIndependentPart`). A confused character's thwart is the exception the rules give
 * ("Confuse, Confused", p. 13) and is not judged. Threat removed as a cost is the cost's own rule ("Cost", p. 13).
 *
 * A branch that names the chosen slot (`if`, `then`, an option) is judged by the effects inside it: "if that scheme
 * has threat on it, remove 3 threat from it" affects the scheme only through its removal, and reading the scheme in a
 * condition does nothing to it (`partCanAffect`).
 *
 * **What can affect nothing is read inside a branch and an option as at the top of an ability** (rules QA of
 * 2026-10-13, docs/qa-wave10-engine-rules.md S2, S4, M2). An `if` is judged by the branch that would run now
 * (`branchesThatCouldRun`; owner answer 59A, 2026-10-13): a removal with no threat to take is a
 * lost part inside it too, a part of its own inside it keeps the ability initiable, and a branch whose condition is
 * false now is no part at all. A "choose one" does not offer an option that requires a target and has none (RRG 1.8
 * "Choose (Option)", p. 12; `optionLacksValidTarget`). A printed cost scripted as leading effects is no part of the
 * effect (`AbilityDefinition.costEffects`; RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 13).
 *
 * A character that cannot be healed by the ability (`RuleSpec cannotBeHealed`) is no target for its heal: healing damage
 * is one of the listed effects on a target (p. 42), and moving damage off a character heals it (ruling, Dec 8, 2023,
 * Ruling 125: "you cannot target him with Tic-Tac-Toe while Protect the Senator is in play").
 *
 * An effect that names the chosen slot and is not one of the judged kinds (`thwart`, `removeThreat`, `dealDamage`,
 * `attack`, `discardFromPlay`, `flipCard`, `defeat`, `heal` aimed straight at the slot, `moveThreat` from it) is assumed able to affect
 * the target: the "multiple effects" bullet makes the target valid if any one effect can, so an effect this module
 * cannot judge never makes a target invalid. An attack that also stuns its target keeps a target that cannot take its
 * damage, and so does a piercing attack on a target with a tough card (`attackPiercesTough`; ruling Jul 11, 2025).
