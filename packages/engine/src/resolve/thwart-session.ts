/**
 * One "(thwart)" ability is one thwart. RRG 1.8 "Thwart" (p. 44): "An ability labeled as a thwart is considered a
 * single thwart, even if that thwart removes multiple instances of threat", and "If an ability increases the amount
 * of threat an ability labeled as a thwart removes and that ability removes multiple instances of threat, each of
 * those instances that does not use the word 'additional' is increased by the specified amount." Owner decision,
 * 2026-10-03 (and Q78, docs/phase7-wave6.md §4.1, for the per-instance increase).
 *
 * Each instance of threat a "(thwart)" ability removes by its controller's identity (one scheme of an "each scheme",
 * one share of a division, one of two "remove N threat from a scheme" sentences) is still its own `thwart` event
 * frame, so each is checked, paid for (`additionalThwartCost`) and removed on its own. The frames are tied to the
 * ability by `TriggerEvent thwart.abilityFrameId`, the root effects frame of the ability's resolution, which carries
 * the `ThwartSession`:
 *
 * - **"When you thwart" is heard once**, as the first instance initiates: only that frame opens an interrupt window
 *   (and logs `initiated`). What an interrupt adds ("that thwart removes 1 additional threat", `modifyThwart`) is kept
 *   on the session and added to every instance; cancelling that thwart cancels every instance.
 * - **"After you thwart" is heard once**, when the ability's effects have all resolved: the root frame then pushes one
 *   resolved `thwart` event whose `amount` is the threat every instance removed together, with `instances` listing
 *   each scheme and its amount when there were several. `schemeInstanceId` is the first instance's scheme, and the
 *   event's targets (`eventTarget`, `targetIs`, `selfIs: "target"`) are every scheme an instance was aimed at. Its
 *   results are the instances' results summed. No instance logs its own `resolved` line or opens its own window.
 *
 * A basic thwart and a thwart by another character (an ally's "it thwarts") have no session and resolve as before.
