 *   does nothing for it): "when any amount of threat would be placed" and "after threat is placed" have not happened.
 *   Maintainer reading: the RRG does not define "any amount" for threat.
 * - **Damage.** RRG 1.8 "Damage" (p. 14) words every step around damage as "any amount of damage" ("would deal/be
 *   dealt", "would take", "takes", "after … deals/is dealt/takes"), and "Tough" (p. 44) the same ("would take any

 *   (a 0 ATK attack, an attack a defender's DEF covered, an X of 0) has no "would" window, is neither dealt nor
 *   taken, and nothing answers it afterwards. The attack it came from still happened: "after [enemy] attacks",
 *   "after [character] defends" and retaliate key off the attack, not the damage (p. 9 step 6, "Retaliate X", p. 38).
 * - **Damage an interrupt prevented in full.** Its interrupt window did open (the amount was positive), and once
 *   `preventDamage` has taken the event's `amount` to 0 no further interrupt is gathered for it: nothing is left that
 *   "would" be taken. Afterwards the damage was dealt and not taken (RRG 1.8 "Prevent", p. 35: "the amount of damage
 *   'dealt' is not reduced"), exactly as damage a tough status card, a constant or "cannot take damage" stopped: the
 *   event carries `dealt` (positive) and `taken` (0), its response window opens, "after X deals / is dealt damage"
 *   fires and "after X takes damage" does not (owner ruling 2026-10-07, overruling the 2026-10-06 reading that a full
