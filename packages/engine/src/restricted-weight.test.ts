/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.82: `PlayerCard.restrictedWeight`, "Counts as 2 restricted cards." on a card
 * without the restricted keyword. Synthetic cards shaped like Laser Swords (`deadpool` 44055, a Weapon upgrade), Venom
 * (20001a: "You can control 1 additional upgrade that has the restricted keyword.") and Side Holster (20021: "… 1
 * additional [Weapon] upgrade that has the restricted keyword.").
 *
 * The weighted card adds its weight to the load the limit is compared with (`restrictedLoadOf`), is one of the player's
 * restricted cards (a single card), and is offered for the discard over the limit, freeing its whole weight (contributor's
 * rules call 2026-10-16 (bluefireF5ran), reversing upstream Q52 = B).
