/**
 * `AbilityCost.returnToHand` as a list of picks (docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.70). Synthetic cards shaped like "Alliance.
 * Action: Choose a [Red] ally and a [Blue] ally and return them to their owners' hands → those players play those
 * allies, ignoring their resource costs."
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Cost" (p. 13): a cost's components are paid simultaneously and one card cannot pay two of them,
 * and a cost that cannot be paid in full is not paid at all; "Alliance" (p. 6): any player may help pay; "Leaves
 * Play" (p. 27): a card that left play and comes back is a new copy of it.
