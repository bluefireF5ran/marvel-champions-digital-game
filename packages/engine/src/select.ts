 *
 * - **Found in an open area** (in play, tucked, set aside, a hand, a discard pile): no deck was searched (RRG 1.8
 *   "Find", p. 19: "Players should not unnecessarily search game areas if they know where the card they are looking
 *   for can be found"), so none is shuffled.
 * - **Found in a deck**: that deck, and each deck the card could have been in that the find looks through before it.
 * - **Not found**: every deck the card could have been in.
 *
 * The decks a card "could be found" in (p. 19) follow from whose card it is, which the players know: a player's card
 * could be in its owner's deck and separate decks, since it goes back to its owner's out-of-play areas (RRG 1.8
 * "Ownership and Control", p. 31); an encounter card (no owner) in an encounter deck or a scenario deck. With `owners`
 * ("your Touched") the card is theirs. Without, it is read from the copies of the card this game has, wherever they
 * are now; a card with no copy in the game at all could be in any player deck or encounter deck, so each of those is
 * searched. An empty deck holds nothing to look through and is not shuffled.
 *
 * **A special deck** (an identity's separate deck, `PlayerState.separateDecks`; a scenario deck,
 * `GameState.scenarioDecks`) is made of its own cards only, which every player knows, so the card "could be found"
 * there only when the find can name one of that deck's own cards (`specialDeckCouldHold`): a find for an ally does not
 * look through, or shuffle, a deck of encounter attachments or of Permanent upgrades (the owner's answer 54B,
 * 2026-10-13, docs/phase7-wave10.md §4.0; RRG 1.8 "Find", p. 19: "each game area where that card could be found").
 * A special deck the find does look through is shuffled like any other.

 * Class-wide text blanking: "Treat the printed text box of each [Tech] player card as if it were blank" (Tech Theft),

 * instance ids and so needs no registry; a constant rule has to be found in play, which the naive version gets wrong
 * twice (docs/phase7-wave2.md §8):
 *
 * 1. **Recursion.** Finding the rule needs the in-play cards' live abilities, and matching its `{ trait: TECH }`
 *    target needs `traitsOf`, which needs them too. Both are cut the same way `traitsOf` already cuts trait grants:
 *    the scan below reads each source's refs with the *lasting* blank check only, and evaluates the rule's own
 *    `target`/`while` under `DEFAULT_DEPS`, so granted traits and keywords are never consulted. A blanking rule
 *    therefore cannot depend on another blanking rule, and the answer is a fixed point after one pass.
 * 2. **Cost.** `activeAbilityRefs` is the engine's hottest read, called once per in-play card inside `activeRules`,
 *    `traitsOf`, `grantedKeywords` and `statModifiers`, each of which runs per query candidate. Scanning the board
 *    on every lookup would make all of those quadratic. Two memos keep it O(1) amortized, both over **immutable
 *    inputs and never over game state the engine reads back**: which ability ids carry the rule (per `EngineDeps`,
 *    fixed for a whole game) and which cards are blanked (per `GameState`, which is replaced on every mutation and
 *    never edited in place). A registry with no such rule — Core, wave 1 and all of cycle 1 — short-circuits on the
 *    first `WeakMap` hit, so nothing that exists today pays anything at all.
