/**
 * The setup half of RRG 1.8 Appendix II (p. 51), as steps the flow can stop between.
 *
 * `createGame` builds the state and then has to *run* setup: shuffle, starting threat, setup cards, the scenario's
 * own setup abilities, the draw, the mulligan. A standalone game runs the whole block inline, exactly as it always
 * has, and its step sequence is untouched. A **campaign** game cannot: MC60 p. 9 prints instructions that resolve
 * *before* scenario setup, and a campaign instruction is an ordinary `EffectSpec` list that may stop for a choice —
 * so it has to resolve through the stack, between flow steps. Hence this module: one function per block, called
 * inline by `createGame` for a standalone game and by `flow.ts` as a step for a campaign game, so the two can never
 * drift apart.
 *
 * Where each window sits, and why, is `CAMPAIGN_WINDOW_ORDER` in `campaign.ts`.

 *   it (`CampaignOp` `composeEncounterSets` `into: "setAside"`, `setAsideCards`; MC21's Norn Stone, handed out by a
 *   side scheme's When Defeated). It is never taken. A campaign card a player has earned begins in play from that
