/**
 * docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.66: the pod's shared main scheme, and when its completion loses the game with one group
 * (§4.1 Q9 = A, the owner's decision of 2026-10-09: by the insert). Synthetic cards shaped like Worlds Collide (`tt`
 * 55028b) and Mischief and Mayhem 1B's two interrupts (55033b: "place 1 threat on Worlds Collide instead").
 *
 * Sources: MC55 p. 21: at the target "Each group in the middle of a villain phase must finish any abilities currently
 * resolving, then stop play immediately; each group in the middle of a player phase may finish that phase as normal. If
 * Loki, God of Lies is defeated before all player phases in all groups end, all players in all groups win the game!
 * However, if Loki, God of Lies remains undefeated when all player phases in all groups end, all players in all groups
 * lose the game." Card 55028b: "If this stage is completed, the players lose the game." With one group, no player phase
 * is running during the villain phase, so the loss there is at once.
