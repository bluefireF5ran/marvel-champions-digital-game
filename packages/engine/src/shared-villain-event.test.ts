/**
 * docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.66: the pod's shared villain. Damage to it is a shared event through one pure reducer
 * (`applySharedEvent`), and what the damage brings about is applied once the resolution in progress has finished.
 * Synthetic cards shaped like Loki, God of Lies (`tt` 55027a/b) and the Shatter the Illusion card's step 1.
 *
 * Sources: MC55 p. 20: "There is only one way for players to deal damage to Loki, God of Lies"; at 10 per player
 * remaining "the ability on Loki, God of Lies causes it to flip … Each group should pause gameplay activity in their
 * game area, first finishing any actions or abilities that are currently resolving. Then, the 'When Revealed' ability
 * on Loki, God of Lies triggers". Card 55027b: "If Loki, God of Lies is defeated, all players in all groups win the
 * game." The two-group and remote cases are on hand-built records: no game of this project has more than one group.
