   * to carry the restriction as a constant ability — the restriction has to outlive its source (RRG 1.8 "Lasting

   *
   * `until`:
   * - `"endOfPhase"` / `"endOfRound"` — the ordinary boundaries;
   * - `"endOfTurn"` — the turn in progress; like every other "this turn" effect it is **not created** outside one
   *   (RRG 1.8 "Lasting Effects", p. 26, and §13.3);
   * - `"endOfNextTurn"` — "until your next turn ends": the first turn `player` *begins* from now on. Created
   *   whenever the effect resolves, including in the villain phase, which is where both obligations resolve.
   *
   * `player` is whose turn `"endOfNextTurn"` waits for; absent, the ability's controller ("**your** next turn").
   * It is read for that duration only.
   *
   * `"endOfAttack"` — "until after that attack resolves" (In Cold Blood, `sm` 27029: "The Lizard attacks you. You
   * cannot play events until after that attack resolves."). `attack` says which attack:
   * - `"current"` (the default): the attack or activation already resolving (`currentActivationFrameId`), the same
   *   frame `modifyStatUntil`'s `"endOfAttack"` names. Not created outside one.
   * - `"initiated"`: the attack the **next `enemyAttack` of this same effects frame** initiates. It is written
   *   *before* that `enemyAttack`, so the rule is already active when the attack begins, its interrupt windows
   *   included. The printed sentence comes after the attack, but it covers the attack's whole resolution. Until the
   *   attack is initiated the rule waits on the frame (`LastingDuration awaitingAttack`); `enemyAttack` then retimes
   *   it to the attack's event frame (`lastingEffectRetimed`). It expires when that frame finishes: after the
   *   attack's response window and its end-of-attack effects, the point every "this attack" effect ends (RRG 1.8
   *   "Lasting Effects", p. 26: it expires "as soon as the timing point specified by its duration is reached").
   *   Several attacks from that one effect ("each X attacks you") scope it to the last of them, which resolves
   *   last. If no attack is made (the enemy is not in play, or a stun cancels it), or the frame finishes without
   *   reaching an `enemyAttack`, the rule ends then: it never outlives an attack that did not happen. An
   *   `enemyAttack` deferred behind the current activation (`after: "currentActivation"`) runs in a later frame, so
   *   it is not one this frame initiates.
   *
   * The attack's frame id comes from the state's frame sequence, so replay retimes it identically.
   *
   * `"endOfPaidFor"` — "that attack" on a resource ability (Ruby Quartz Visor 33003: "generate a [energy] resource for
   * your 'Optic Blast' ability. That attack gains piercing and ranged"; docs/phase7-wave6.md §3.30). A resource
   * ability's effects resolve with the payment, before the ability or card paid for (`announceResourcesSpent`), so
   * "that attack" does not exist yet. The rule lasts until the paid-for ability or card finishes resolving: the
   * topmost `ability` / `playCard` frame on the stack for the card in slot `paidFor` (`LastingDuration endOfPaidFor`).
   * Only that use is touched; a later use of the same ability is not. Not created outside a payment for an ability or
   * a card (a basic power has no such frame).

   * `AbilityCost.distinctResourceTypes` uses (`distinctTypeCount`): each wild is any one type not otherwise present
   * (RRG 1.8 "Wild Resource", p. 48). A payment of one type only is too little: nothing is spent and `<bind>.made` is 0.
   *
   * `required`: the spend is not the player's to decline, because they already chose it: the "spend" option of a
   * "choose to either spend 1 resource of any type or place 1 threat on the main scheme" (the alternative is the other
   * option of the `chooseOne`, not a `<bind>.made` branch). A player who chose an option resolves it, so:
   * - the payment must pay `resources` (and `distinctTypes`) in full: a `resolveChoice` that selects nothing, or too
   *   little, is refused and the choice stays pending (as a cost's payment is, RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 13). Overpaying is
   *   legal;
   * - a `chooseOne` does not offer an option holding a required spend its player cannot pay (`executeChooseOne`).
   *   RRG 1.8 "Choose (Option)" (p. 12) says so for a player card ("cannot choose an option … [that has] a cost the
   *   player cannot pay"); for an encounter card that paragraph names only options without targets, and this follows
   *   the owner's standing default instead (docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.2 Q8 = A, docs/phase7-wave6.md Q51: the choice is
   *   a price, so an option is offered only to a player who can carry it out);
   * - reached all the same by a player who cannot pay (the only option left, or no `chooseOne` around it), nobody is
   *   asked, nothing is spent and `<bind>.made` is 0.
   * Without it the effect is the "either spend … or" / "you may spend" prompt above, where paying nothing declines.
   *
   * `x`: "you may spend X [mental] resources to prevent X of that threat" (Battle of Wits, `aos` 50175; A.I.M.
   * Interference 50184). `resources` is then the price of one, and the player sets X before paying:
   * 1. X runs from 0 to the smaller of `x.max` (read as the effect resolves) and the most that player could pay from
   *    their payment options now (`canPaySpend` of X times `resources`). With no player or a top of 0 nobody is asked.
   * 2. The player chooses X (a `chooseNumber` choice, logged as `numberChosen`; asked even when the range is 0 to 1,
   *    since 0 is the "may" declined). Choosing 0 ends the effect there.
   * 3. They pay X times `resources` in **one** payment (a `spendResources` choice, `required`: the player chose to
   *    spend, so nothing less than a payment in full is accepted, RRG 1.8 "Cost", p. 13; overpaying is legal), so a
   *    card that generates two of the type pays for 2.
   * `<bind>.amount` is X as paid (0 when nothing was) and `<bind>.made` is 1 when X is at least 1. Not combined with
   * `required` or `distinctTypes`.
