/**
 * A readable, read-only view of `state.stack` for a client that wants to show what is resolving and what is queued.
 *
 * `describeFrame`/`viewStack` stay what they are — one debug string per frame, good for a log. This is the structured
 * half: every field a row of a stack panel needs, as data, so the client words it and the engine never grows prose.
 *
 * Nothing here is a rule. It restates no rule either: every value is read straight off the frame that is already on
 * the stack. The one derived field is `openWindow`, which is `PendingChoice.frameId` (`choices.ts`) matched against
 * each frame — the engine already records which frame an open decision belongs to, so "← you are answering this one"
 * needs no new state.
