/**
 * `AbilityTriggerSpec stateCheck` with `fromEntering`: a standing condition printed as a constant ability ("If Fantomex
 * is not in play, discard E.V.A.", `next_evol` 40021) resolves when it is first seen already true, not only when it
 * becomes true later.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Ability" (p. 4): "A constant ability becomes active as soon as its card enters play and remains active while
 * the card is in play", and one that seeks a condition ("during", "if", "while") is "active anytime the specific
 * condition is met". Owner ruling 2026-10-05 (docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1, on the NeXt Evolution FAQ "Can E.V.A. ever be
 * in play while Fantomex is not?"): the card is discarded immediately. So the first look is the moment the card is in
 * play: before any interrupt or response to its entering play is offered, and with the counters its uses keywords place
 * as it enters counted. A card the check takes out of play gets no enter-play window at all. After that first look the
 * check is edge-triggered and does not repeat while the condition stays true. A check without the flag keeps the old
 * reading (docs/phase7-wave1.md §4.1): its first observation only records.
