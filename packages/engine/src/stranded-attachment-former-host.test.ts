/**
 * `TriggerEvent cardLeavesPlay.strandedAttachments` (docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.61): a permanent player card attached to an
 * encounter card stays in play, unattached, when its host leaves (RRG 1.8 "Permanent", p. 32; "Attach To", p. 8), and
 * the leaving is still "attached [card] leaves play" to it. Synthetic cards shaped like "Permanent. Forced Response:
 * After attached enemy leaves play, set this card aside."
 *
 * The leaving card's snapshot lists the attachments that stay; `hostOfSelf` and `TargetRef host` read that event's card
 * as the host of each of them while it is unattached.
