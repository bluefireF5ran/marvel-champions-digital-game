/**
 * `TriggerEvent cardLeavesPlay.strandedAttachments` (docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.61): a permanent player card attached to an
 * encounter card whose own text answers its host leaving stays in play, unattached, when its host leaves, and the
 * leaving is still "attached [card] leaves play" to it. Synthetic cards shaped like Frostbite's "Permanent. Forced
 * Response: After attached enemy leaves play, set this card aside." One with no such text is removed from the game, or
 * moved by its "attach to" text (RRG 1.8 "Permanent", p. 32; `removedWithoutHost` in `effects.ts`).
 *
 * The leaving card's snapshot lists the attachments that stay; `hostOfSelf` and `TargetRef host` read that event's card
 * as the host of each of them while it is unattached.
