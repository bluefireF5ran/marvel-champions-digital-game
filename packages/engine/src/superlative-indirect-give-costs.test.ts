/**
 * Three cost shapes the Osborn Tech modular (`sm` 27147–27150) needed, on synthetic support cards whose effect is
 * "draw 2 cards", so a test can tell the effect resolving from the cost being paid:
 *
 * - `InPlayCostPick.superlative`: "Discard the highest-cost upgrade you control →" (Arm Cannon, 27147).
 * - `AbilityCost.indirectDamage`: "Take 3 indirect damage →" (Kinetic Armor, 27149).
 * - `AbilityCost.giveStatus` / `giveBoostCards`: "Give the villain a tough status card and 1 facedown boost card →"
 *   (Neocarbon Scales, 27150).
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Cost" (pp. 13–14: paid in full or not at all; "If taking damage is a cost, that cost is not
 * considered paid unless all of that damage was taken"), "Initiating Abilities" (p. 24, steps 3 and 5), "Indirect
 * Damage" (p. 24), "Status Cards" (p. 41), "Boost, Boost Icon" (p. 11), "Encounter Deck" (p. 17), and the Focused Rage
 * FAQ entry (p. 57: a damage cost a tough status card would prevent cannot be paid).
