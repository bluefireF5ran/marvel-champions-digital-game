/**
 * Rules QA of 2026-10-13 (docs/qa-wave10-engine-rules.md, findings S2, S3, S4, M2, questions Q-C and Q-E): what can
 * affect nothing right now is judged inside a branch and an option as it is at the top of an ability.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Target" (p. 42): "If an ability or game function requires one or more targets, that ability or game function
 * can only be initiated if it has at least one valid target", a target being valid "if any part of that ability can
 * affect that target"; a scheme with no threat is no target for a removal of threat (`threat-removal-target.test.ts`).
 * "Choose (Option)" (p. 12): "When a player card requires a player to choose an option, they cannot choose an option
 * that cannot be at least partially resolved. This includes options that … Require one or more targets and there are
 * no valid targets." "Cost" (p. 13): "An ability's cost cannot be paid if that ability's effect requires one or more
 * targets and there is not at least one valid target."
 *
 * Owner answers 57A ("from each scheme" with no threat anywhere: refused), 58A (a part that needs no target keeps a
 * removal playable, whatever its condition on how the card was paid for) and 59A (the branch that would run is the
 * one judged), all 2026-10-13. Synthetic cards only.
