/**
 * docs/competitive-mode-plan.md §3.3 and §4 task 3: every per player value is read through the team of the card it is
 * printed on (`perPlayerCount` in `team.ts`, `perPlayerCountAt` in `query.ts`).
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 "Per Player Icon" (p. 32): "The icon next to a value multiplies that value by the number of players
 * who started the scenario. If a player is eliminated, this value does not change."; MC56 p. 20: per player values
 * apply only "to the players on your team". A cooperative game has one team of every seat, so its numbers are the
 * ones the icon has always given. No setup makes a second team, so the two-team side is read on `twoTeamState`.
 *
 * Synthetic cards only, put where they are read by hand: what is tested is the number each reader returns.
