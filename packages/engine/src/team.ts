/**
 * Team membership (docs/competitive-mode-plan.md §3.3, §4 task 2; docs/phase7-wave10.md §3.4; MC56 pp. 6, 14, 20):
 * which players are on which team, and how many of them a per player value counts.
 *
 * A cooperative game is the one-team case: its team is every seat, and it is derived here, never stored (MC56 p. 6:
 * cooperatively, "the enemy team" refers to the players). A competitive game stores two teams. Competitive mode is not
 * built and `createGame` refuses it, so `GameState.teams` is on a state only when a test puts it there
 * (`testing/team.ts`); what reads a team here is already the code a competitive game will run.
 *
 * The team-relative words of a card are answered here too (§4 task 4): "the enemy team", "the enemy leader" and "your
 * leader", each asked for a team.
 *
 * Everything here is pure, and these are the only readers of `GameState.teams`.
