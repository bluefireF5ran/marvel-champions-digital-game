/**
 * The additional cost to thwart a scheme (`RuleSpec additionalThwartCost`, docs/phase7-wave5.md §3.21): whether a player
 * could pay it, and how a basic thwart pays it.
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Cost" (p. 13): "A player must pay all additional costs simultaneously with the cost that is being added to
 * [...] if they cannot pay for all of the costs at once, then they do not pay any of the costs and the effect associated
 * with the costs does not occur", and "If taking damage is a cost, that cost is not considered paid unless all of that
 * damage was taken." "Initiating Abilities" (p. 24) step 3 checks "the player's ability to pay them" before anything is
 * paid, and step 5 aborts "without paying any costs". The user's rulings (§4.1):
 *
 * - **Q18:** a player who cannot pay a scheme's additional thwart cost cannot choose that scheme as a thwart's target.
 *   Read by the basic thwart command (`basicThwartWith`, `actions.ts`) and by target validity for a "(thwart)" effect
 *   (`resolve/target-validity.ts`), so `legalActions` and every target choice agree with the engine.
 * - **Q27:** the additional cost is paid together with the thwart's own cost, and declining it undoes both. A basic
 *   thwart names its schemes in the command, so it asks for the additional cost first (`askBasicThwartCost`) and pays
 *   its own costs (the exhaust, any `basicPowerCosts`) only once that is paid (`executeSettleBasicThwartCost`).
 * - **Q28:** a thwart event's (or thwart ability's) payability is judged after its own cost is paid, at play time
 *   (`playCard`/`useAbility` check again once they have paid) as at the target choice.
 * - **Q29:** a divided basic thwart must afford the total of every chosen scheme's additional cost (`thwartCostTotal`),
 *   asked and paid once.
 * - **Q30:** a "take damage" cost that is partly prevented, or that could not all be assigned, was not paid: the
 *   thwart does not happen (for a basic thwart, with Q27's undo).
 * - **Q40:** a confused hero's or ally's basic thwart is asked for (and must be able to pay, Q18) the additional cost
 *   like any other, since "Costs associated with the thwart attempt [...] must still be paid" (RRG 1.8 "Confuse,
 *   Confused", p. 13); once paid, its own costs are paid and the confused card replaces the thwart. A confused
 *   identity's "(thwart)" ability is cancelled as it is triggered (RRG 1.8 "Labeled Ability", p. 26), before it
 *   chooses a scheme, so it never reaches the fallback below and is asked nothing.
 *
 * **The fallback** is the §3.21 question as the thwart resolves (`askThwartCost`, `resolve/event.ts`), which a thwart
 * *effect* still uses: an event or ability chooses its target while it resolves, after its own cost was paid at play,
 * so there is nothing left to undo by then. Declining there, or a damage cost not fully taken, cancels that thwart
 * and its own cost stays paid. A basic thwart whose cost was paid up front is marked (`thwartCostPaid` on its event
 * frame) and is not asked again.
