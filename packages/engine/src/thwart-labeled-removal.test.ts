/**
 * A "(thwart)"-labeled ability is a real thwart (owner decision, 2026-10-03), however its threat removal is written.
 *
 * - RRG 1.8 "Labeled Ability" (p. 26): "When a player resolves an ability labeled '(thwart),' that ability is
 *   considered to be a thwart made by that player's identity." That the card does not use the hero's THW is beside the
 *   point.
 * - RRG 1.8 "Patrol" (p. 32): "While a minion with the patrol keyword is engaged with a player, that player cannot use
 *   cards they control to thwart the main scheme." So patrol stops a labeled removal from the main scheme, and leaves
 *   an unlabeled "remove N threat" alone.
 * - RRG 1.8 "Target" (p. 43): "A target that cannot be thwarted is not a valid target for a thwart-labeled ability."
 * - RRG 1.8 "Thwart" (p. 44): "An ability labeled as a thwart is considered a single thwart, even if that thwart removes
 *   multiple instances of threat." Owner decision Q78 (docs/phase7-wave6.md §4.1): an "additional threat" modifier
 *   (Operative Skill's shape) increases each instance of threat removal.
 *
 * So `removeThreat`, `divide("threat")` and `modifyAttack.removesThreat` resolved by a "(thwart)" ability make `thwart`
 * events by the controller's identity, exactly as the `thwart` effect does. Synthetic cards; the default hero's THW is
 * not used by any of them. No FFG ruling in the post-RRG 1.7 transcript names these cards.
