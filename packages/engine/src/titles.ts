/**
 * Naming a character by title, the way Team-Up cards do (docs/phase7-wave3.md §3.34).
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Team-Up" (p. 43) spells the keyword out as a constant: "You cannot include this card in your deck unless
 * your alter-ego or hero title matches name 1 or name 2. You cannot play this card unless there is a friendly
 * character in play whose title or subtitle matches name 1 and a friendly character in play whose title or subtitle
 * matches name 2." Its effects then name the same characters: "Ready Cyclops and Phoenix", "Heal 3 damage each from
 * Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales", "a Rocket Raccoon upgrade", "the total ATK of Colossus and Wolverine". Every reader
 * of those names goes through here, so the play check, deckbuilding and card effects cannot disagree.
 *
 * - **A character in play** matches a name by the title it is showing: an identity by its faceup side only (RRG 1.8
 *   "Identity", p. 23: "If a card refers to a hero or alter-ego by title, it refers only to the identity with that
 *   title, and not to the other side of the card"), any other character by its title or subtitle (RRG 1.8
 *   "Subtitle", p. 41). Groot and Rocket Raccoon print the same title on both sides; Gwen Stacy / Miles Morales and
 *   Cindy Moon / Peter Parker are alter-ego titles, which match only while that side is up.
 * - **An identity card** (deckbuilding, and "a <name> card" for an identity-specific set) matches by any of its
 *   titles: its hero face(s), its alter-ego face, or the card's own name.
 * - **"Hero/Alter-ego"** — "Black Panther/T'Challa and Black Panther/Shuri" (Heart of the Panther, `bp` 51025) — names
 *   one identity card by both of its sides, because the two Black Panthers share a hero title. It matches an identity
 *   whose hero face is the first half and whose alter-ego face is the second, whichever side is up. A reading of the
 *   printed disambiguation (§4 Q13): no rule text covers the slash. Any other character matches by its title or
 *   subtitle against the second half: FFG ruled that Black Panther (Shuri) and the T'Challa ally (51002) in play let
 *   Heart of the Panther be played (ruling November 21, 2025, on RRG 1.8 "Team-Up", p. 43; issue #425).
