/**
 * docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.44: a minion that stays in play attached to an ally it treats as a minion, and the encounter
 * attachment of the same family. Synthetic cards shaped like "When Defeated: Attach [this minion] to the non-[PSIONIC]
 * ally with the highest cost. Attached ally engages its controller. Treat attached ally as a [POSSESSED] minion with a
 * blank text box (except for traits). Attached minion's SCH is equal to its THW and it does not take consequential
 * damage." and "Treat attached ally as a ['POOL] minion with a blank text box. Attached minion's SCH is equal to its
 * printed THW and it does not take consequential damage. When Revealed: Attach to the ally with the highest cost
 * without [this card] attached. Attached ally engages its controller. Otherwise, this card gains surge." (erratum, RRG
 * 1.8 p. 69).
 *
 * Sources: RRG 1.8 FAQ "Malice (#199)" (p. 64), five bullets; ruling, Dec 17, 2025 (1) #3 (a status change: the
 * character "retains all tokens and attachments"); ruling, Jun 25, 2026 (4) #5 ("Characters not under player control
 * are not friendly characters"); owner decisions §4.1 Q26 (a minion only, never "an attachment") and Q27 ("its THW" is
 * the ally's THW with its modifiers, "its printed THW" the printed value).
