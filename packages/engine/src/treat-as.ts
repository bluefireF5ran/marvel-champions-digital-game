/**
 * Keeps `CardInstance.treatedAs` in step with what causes it (docs/phase7-wave4.md §3.9, §3.29):
 *
 * - an ally with a `treatHostAsMinion` card attached to it is a minion until that card goes (Beguiled, an attachment;
 *   a minion its own When Defeated attached to the ally, docs/phase7-wave7.md §3.44);
 * - a minion with a `treatHostAsAlly` attachment on it is its controller's ally until that attachment goes (Mind
 *   Control);
 * - a minion a `treatAsAlly` effect took is its controller's ally while the effect's card stays in play (Karma).
 * - a minion whose own `treatSelfAsAlly` constant holds is the ally of the player a `takeControl` effect named, for as
 *   long as that constant holds (Black Cat, docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md §S3.8; `syncOwnTreatments`).
 * - an ally a `treatAsMinion` constant's query matches is a minion while the rule is active and still matches it
 *   (Baron Zemo, "each ally with threat on it", docs/phase7-wave11-scenarios.md §S3.9; `syncRuleTreatments`).
 * - a hero from a collection, an identity card that is no seat's identity, is a minion while a `treatHostAsMinion`
 *   card is attached to it, and is in play only for that long (Reluctant Foe, docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.30): when the
 *   attachment goes and the hero is not leaving play itself, the hero is removed from the game (§4.1 Q39 = A).
 *
 * `relocateCard` calls `syncTreatedAs` whenever a card moves onto or off a host, which is every attach, detach and
 * discard of an attachment, so the flag never lags a frame behind the attachment ("Attach to the ally with the highest
 * cost … Attached ally engages its controller" engages a minion in the same ability); `leavePlay` calls
 * `releaseTreatedBy` for a source leaving play. Ruling, Dec 17, 2025 (1) #3: nothing enters or leaves play; it is
 * "essentially a status change", so tokens and attachments stay.
