   *
   * Two shapes (wave 5 §4.1 Q17: RRG 1.8 "Interrupt", p. 25; ruling Jan 17, 2026 (1) #2):
   * - with `leaving`: pushed by `leavePlay` *before* the move, when some interrupt hears it. The card is still in play,
   *   with its attachments, counters and controller, while the interrupt window runs; the apply step performs the move
   *   `leaving` describes (`applyLeavingPlay`) and the responses see the card gone. A replacement ("… instead") cancels
   *   the event and moves the card itself; that move is announced after the "cancelled" line (§4.1 Q34). The
   *   attachments leaving with it wait with it (`leaving: withHost`, §4.1 Q32), and every card leaving from one step
   *   shares one interrupt window and one response window (§4.1 Q33).
   * - without it: recorded by `leavePlay` after the move (`pendingLeftPlay`) and announced between frames, when no
   *   interrupt heard it before the move; its interrupt window, if any, is late. `interruptsResolved` marks a card that
   *   left during its own leaving's interrupt window (a replacement's move): only the responses open.
   *
   * Either way the event carries what the card was while still in play — `cardId`, `controllerId` and `traits` (granted
   * ones included) — and a trigger's `targetIs` trait clauses read `traits`. `to` is where it went (with `leaving`: where
   * it is going, until the apply step sets where it went). The card's own abilities answer the responses from wherever
