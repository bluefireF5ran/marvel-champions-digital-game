/**
 * Ruling October 10, 2025 (Alex), question 2: Tower Defense (two main schemes), M.U.S.I.C. is defeated while

 * Focused Defense attachment. (Since threat is being 'moved' from one scheme to another, the number of tokens placed
 * should be fixed; and the player should not be able to split the tokens, so this is the simplest way to progress.)"
 * RRG 1.8 p. 30 "Move" is silent on two main schemes; MC21 p. 10 says an encounter card's "the main scheme" is both
 * schemes, which the ruling narrows for this move.
 *
 * The shipped script is `51034.when-defeated` = `whenDefeated(moveThreat(find(Manipulated M.U.S.I.C.), theMainScheme))`
 * (`cards/src/wave9/bp/black-panther/obligation-nemesis.ts`); this is its shape on synthetic cards. The engine's
 * `moveThreat` takes the first of the targets `{ kind: "mainScheme" }` resolves to for an encounter card, which is
 * both main schemes in `sharedMainSchemes` order, not the one holding Focused Defense.
