/**
 * RRG "Unique Icon ()" — one copy of a unique card, by *match*, in play across the table.
 *
 * Source: Marvel Champions Rules Reference, version 1.8 (© 2026), pp. 45–46, entry
 * "Unique Icon ()". Version 1.8 replaced the older "by title, with carve-outs for
 * identities and allies" wording with a single symmetric *match* predicate, quoted in
 * full here because everything in this module is a direct transcription of it:
 *
 *   "The unique icon indicates a card that represents a singular person, place, or thing
 *    within the Marvel universe.
 *    - Two unique cards are considered to 'match' if any of the following apply:
 *        - The two cards share a title, and both have no subtitle and no alter-ego title.
 *          (For example, two copies of the Jarnbjorn upgrade, or the Jessica Jones ally
 *          and the Jessica Jones minion.)
 *        - The subtitle or alter-ego title of one matches the title, subtitle, or
 *          alter-ego title of the other. (For example, the identity with the T'Challa
 *          alter-ego, the T'Challa ally, and the Black Panther ally with the subtitle
 *          'T'Challa' are all considered to match.)
 *    - During deckbuilding, a player cannot include multiple matching cards in their deck.
 *      The identity is included in this evaluation. [...]
 *    - When choosing identities during setup, players cannot choose identities that match.
 *        - The players may choose a scenario even if one or more villains match one or
 *          more chosen identities.
 *    - A non-villain card in an out-of-play state that matches a card in play cannot enter
 *      play. If the out-of-play card is:
 *        - A player card, it cannot be played or put into play. Any effect that attempts
 *          to do so has no effect.
 *        - A non-villain encounter card, it is discarded and any effects of it entering
 *          play are ignored. If it was being revealed, any effects of it being revealed
 *          are ignored and the player revealing it is dealt a facedown encounter card."
 *
 * Two consequences worth spelling out, because they are easy to get wrong:
 *
 * 1. Matching is a pairwise *relation*, not an equivalence class, so it cannot be reduced
 *    to a string key. It is not transitive: "X" (bare) matches "Y (X)", and "Y (X)"
 *    matches "Z (Y)", but "X" does not match "Z (Y)". Every check here is a pairwise scan.
 * 2. The restriction is on the card *entering* play being non-villain. Nothing exempts a
 *    card already *in* play — a villain in play still blocks a matching minion from
 *    entering (FFG's Ronan the Accuser ruling), and an identity in play still blocks a
 *    matching ally.
