/**
 * An independent check of the villain side's procedure over a recorded game.

 * `auditVillainPhases` replays a `GameLog` and follows every villain phase

 * tokens, the first player). It does not reuse the engine's villain-phase code,
 * so a regression there shows up as a violation instead of agreeing with
 * itself. The per-phase records are also a readable trace of what the villain
 * side did and which decisions it handed to players — the "why did the villain
 * do that?" view for rules QA and the client's log.
