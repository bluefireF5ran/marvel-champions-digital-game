/**
 * Who may see a card's face — as a rule over zones, owned by the engine.
 *
 * `CardInstance.faceup` is about the *table*, not about who is looking: a card in a hand is not faceup, and a card in
 * a discard pile may never have been turned over, yet both are things a player is plainly entitled to read. So
 * visibility is a question of zone first and of that flag second:
 *
 *  - a hand and any discard pile are open (RRG 1.8 "Discard Pile", p. 16: "Each discard pile is open information, and
 *    may be looked at by any player at any time"), as is the victory display (p. 47);
 *  - a deck is closed (p. 15 "Deck", p. 17 "Encounter Deck": a deck's order is secret), *except* for the cards an open
 *    decision is offering out of it — an ability that instructs a player to look at or search a deck lets that player
 *    read those cards (p. 27 "Look, Looked-At"), and the shuffle afterwards is what keeps the order secret; and for
 *    the top card of a player deck kept faceup by a card ("Play with the top card of your deck faceup",
 *    `RuleSpec topOfDeckFaceup`, docs/phase7-wave8.md §3.48), which every player sees while that rule holds, as they
 *    do the top card of the encounter deck under the same rule ("Play with the top card of the encounter deck
 *    faceup", `deck: "encounter"`, docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.42);
 *  - a card being played or resolving from out of play (a player's `resolving` area: an event while it resolves, RRG
 *    1.8 "Event", p. 19; a card played off the top of a deck; an Invocation whose Special is resolving) is on the table
 *    for every player to read, though nothing sets its `faceup` flag;
 *  - a set-aside card (the scenario's, or a player's nemesis set) that an open decision is offering is read by the
 *    player deciding ("add one set-aside ally to your hand": they choose among faces), as a card offered out of a
 *    deck is;
 *  - a facedown encounter card dealt to a player is closed, except while a look offers it ("look at each encounter
 *    card dealt to each player", docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.12), and then to the looking player alone; a facedown boost
 *    card on an enemy is the same ("look at that card and the top card of the encounter deck", §3.44);
 *  - everything else is open exactly when it is faceup, which covers a tucked card and a
 *    set-aside nemesis set without naming any of them. Being offered by a decision does not open any of these: only
 *    the deck, dealt-card and set-aside arms read the open decision.
 *
 * **A look is one player's.** RRG 1.8 "Look, Looked-At" (p. 27): "only the player who is resolving the ability can
 * look at those cards". So while the open decision is a look (`ChoicePrompt lookAt` or `rearrange`), a named viewer
 * who is not the looking player sees none of its cards, in a deck or dealt. With no viewer named the deck arms keep
 * the table's answer (see "Whose eyes"). `lookedAtBy` lists the cards an open look shows a player.
 *
 * This lives in the engine because two things need the same answer and must not fork: the client's card rendering
 * (`view/visibility.ts` delegates here) and `preview()`'s truncation rule, which is the thing that stops an outcome
 * preview from quietly peeking at a deck.
 *
 * **Whose eyes.** Today the predicate is table-wide rather than per-player: Phase 4 is multi-handed solo, so every
 * hand at the table belongs to the one human. Phase 5 needs a viewer argument (and, more importantly, a server that
 * does not send a card the viewer may not see). The zone rules above are already written per-zone, so adding a viewer
 * is a change to two `case` arms, not a redesign.
 *
 * The one per-player permission that exists today is passed in as a `ViewerContext`: a card that only one player may
 * look at (RRG 1.8 "Look, Looked-At", p. 27: "only the player who is resolving the ability can look at those cards")
 * has no table-wide answer, so it is face-visible only when a viewer is named and the permission is that viewer's.
 * Without a viewer (the log's card names, `preview()`'s truncation) the card stays hidden.
 *
 * A card a decision offers out of a set-aside area follows the same shape: with a viewer named it is visible to the
 * player the decision belongs to and to no other viewer (p. 27 again); with no viewer named (the table, the log,
 * `preview()`) it is visible, which is the answer the deck arms have always given for an offered card and the right
 * one while one human holds every seat. A client that draws for one seat names that seat; one that draws the open
 * decision's own sheet names the decision's player or the table.
 *
 * **Hidden piles are nobody's.** A card in `GameState.hiddenPiles` (docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.29 (a); MC50 p. 5: put in
 * the envelope "**without looking at them**") is hidden from every player with no exception, and it is not an instance,
 * so `faceVisible` is never asked about it. What a player may be shown of a pile is its size (`hiddenPileViews`); what
 * a client holds or a server sends is the state with the piles' contents taken out (`sealHiddenPiles`). A card that
 * has come out of a pile (`GameState.revealedPileCards`) is open to all.
 *
 * **A hidden reverse is nobody's either.** A double-sided card whose other face no player may look at
 * (`CardInstance.reverseHidden`, docs/phase7-wave9.md §3.54; MC55 p. 7) is in play faceup and its showing face is as
 * open as any card's; its other face is hidden from every player until the card flips (`otherFaceVisible`). The
 * instance's card id is what names both faces, so a client or wire copy of the state names a stand-in instead
 * (`sealHiddenReverses`).
 *
 * A permission every player holds because of a rule on a card (the faceup top card of a deck) needs the rules read
 * but no viewer: a `TableContext` carries the deps alone. A caller that passes neither gets the answer of the zones
 * and the `faceup` flag only, in which that card is still closed.
