/**
 * docs/phase7-wave3.md §4 Q4, resolved 2026-09-25: a defeated minion or ally leaves play **after** its own When Defeated
 * abilities resolve. RRG 1.8 "When Defeated Abilities" (p. 48): "When a villain stage, side scheme, main scheme stage,
 * ally, or minion is defeated, all 'When Defeated' abilities on the card resolve. » A defeated card leaves play after its
 * 'When Defeated' ability is resolved, if any." A side scheme already worked this way (ruling, Jan 11, 2026 (1);
 * `victory-keyword.test.ts`). This file pinned the opposite order for a minion until that date.
 *
 * Overkill: the spill's amount is fixed by the damage that caused the defeat, and it is dealt once the defeat has
 * happened, before the When Defeated ability: "Overkill damage is simultaneous with the damage from the attack" (MC50
 * rulebook FAQ, p. 22; `overkill-simultaneous.test.ts`). Until 2026-10-10 this file pinned the spill after the leaving.
