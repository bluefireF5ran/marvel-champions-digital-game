/**
 * 0 damage opens no damage window (owner ruling 2026-10-06, docs/phase7-wave7.md §4.1; the parallel of "a placement of
 * 0 threat opens no window").
 *
 * RRG 1.8 "Damage" (p. 14) words every step around damage as "any amount of damage": "would deal/be dealt", "would
 * take", "takes" and "after [character] deals/is dealt/takes". "Tough" (p. 44) the same, and both it and "Attack (Enemy
 * Activation)" (p. 9) keep the status card when a basic defense reduces the attack to 0. "Prevent" (p. 35): prevented
 * damage is dealt but not taken, and an attack whose damage was all prevented has not "attacked and damaged". The
 * attack itself still happened (p. 9 step 6; "Retaliate X", p. 38: "after this character is attacked"). "Cost"
 * (p. 14): dealing damage as a cost is paid whatever becomes of the damage.
 *
 * Synthetic cards. Each observer is a forced ability that leaves a counter: the damage observers on the character the
 * damage is aimed at, the attack observers on their own card.
