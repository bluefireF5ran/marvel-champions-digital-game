Card art upgrader: replaces scans in assets/card-art/bundles/cards/ with better
copies from Hall of Heroes (hallofheroeslcg.com).

Six commands:

  audit   Score every local scan for the Fantasy Flight Games diamond watermark
          (the "FF stamp" on the preview images some sets were first scanned
          from) and list the stamped ones. Offline.

  trim    Crop white padding off local scans in place, making the corners
          outside the card's rounded edge transparent (PNG) or frame-coloured
          (JPEG). Offline.

  fetch   Scrape the Hall of Heroes page of each pack, match every card image on
          it to a card code, and replace the local scan when the download is an
          improvement: unstamped, the same orientation and shape, and either
          larger or replacing a stamped scan. Packs with stamped scans go first.
          Hall of Heroes pads its card images with a white border; every
          download is trimmed the same way as `trim` before it is saved.
          `--fill-missing` also adds art for any card the scraped pack has no
          local scan for at all (not just replacements).

          Matching is by filename-as-code or by name (`match_code`) first.
          Some pack pages (Mad Titan's Shadow's box and encounters pages) give
          neither: every image is named by its own per-encounter-set sequence
          (`e1.jpg`, `t7b.jpg`...) with empty alt text, not by card code or
          name. Whatever `match_code` can't place falls back to `match_by_art`:
          a perceptual hash (`phash`) of each remaining candidate against every
          remaining local scan in the pack, resolved by Hungarian assignment
          and only kept where the match is both close and unambiguous. This
          only works for a *replacement* (it needs the existing local scan as
          the reference to match against) — `--fill-missing` still needs a
          name/filename hit for a card with no local scan at all.

  missing Fetches exactly the scans `pnpm --filter @mc/client build` reports as
          referenced by the card pool but absent from the folder — asking the
          build for that list (`vite-card-art.ts`'s own warning) rather than
          restating it here, so the two can't drift. Hall of Heroes is the
          source: it doesn't carry the FFG diamond watermark, and a pack page
          often names a stage/side's B-face separately from MarvelCDB's own
          `imagesrc` (e.g. `kang-7b-kangs-arrival.png`), which `fetch` and the
          generic pack scrape below can miss. A code Hall of Heroes genuinely
          doesn't carry falls back to MarvelCDB's own `imagesrc`/`backimagesrc`
          — audited for the watermark and trimmed the same way, but that is
          necessary, not sufficient: MarvelCDB has served the *wrong face* at
          the *right filename* before (two records can share a filename stem —
          see `_marvelcdb_url_for`), so every MarvelCDB fallback needs a human
          look at the saved file, not just a clean `audit` score, before it's
          trusted. A card only available stamped is left missing (the client's
          generated frame is the correct fallback) rather than saved anyway.
          An external URL in the list (a bad card record, not a missing scan)
          is reported and left alone — that is a `packages/content` data bug,
          not something this script can fetch its way out of.

  grab    One-off scratch download: fetch every image on a Hall of Heroes page
          (optionally filtered by a substring of its alt text or URL), or a
          list of direct image URLs, into an arbitrary destination directory.
          Does not touch assets/card-art/ or its manifest, does not trim or
          score anything, and refuses a destination inside assets/card-art —
          this is for a one-off look (a precon decklist image, a single card
          scan) that should never become part of the versioned art bundle.
          Images are unaltered downloads, saved under the source file name;
          delete them once you're done reading them (CLAUDE.md "Content & IP
          boundaries": no art bytes belong in the repo).

  compress
          (`mise run card-art-compress`, or `pnpm card-art:compress`)
          Re-encodes every local scan that isn't WebP yet as lossy WebP
          (quality 72, transparent corners kept), in place and under its own
          file name, keeping the original whenever WebP would come out larger,
          and scales any scan longer than MAX_EDGE (900px) down to it.
          A scan is recognised as WebP by its bytes, not its extension, so
          the ones already converted and small enough are only read, never
          rewritten, and a second run changes nothing.
          Every scan this script saves is already written that way; this is
          for scans that arrived some other way. Offline. Tauri embeds the
          bundled scans in the desktop executable and every installer carries
          them, so this is most of an installer's size: the whole pool went
          from 665 MB to 207 MB (2026-10-07), checked by eye at full zoom.

  localize
          (`pnpm card-art:localize --lang es`)
          Builds one language's art set in assets/card-art-locales/<lang>/:
          a translated scan for every English scan it has one for, saved
          under the English scan's own path (`bundles/cards/01001a.png`), so
          the client build can lay the set over the English folder and every
          card it lacks keeps its English scan (`vite-card-art.ts`,
          `MC_CARD_LANG`). The source is a community set fetched by card code
          (`LOCALE_SOURCES`), pinned in the set's manifest to the commit it
          was read at. The code is not trusted on its own: a double-sided
          card's faces can be lettered the other way round from ours (Core's
          main scheme `01097`/`01097b` is), so within each card code the
          faces are paired by art (`phash`) rather than by letter, and a pair
          whose art doesn't match, or whose orientation differs, is left out
          and keeps its English scan. Scans are scaled to MAX_EDGE and
          encoded as `compress` does, but not trimmed: the source scans have
          no padding to remove. A second run downloads only what is new;
          `--refresh` downloads everything again.

A replacement or an addition keeps the exact local path a card record names
(`/bundles/cards/<code>.png` or `.jpg`), since that is what `imageRef()` points
at. Each one is recorded in assets/card-art/hall-of-heroes-manifest.tsv.

    Paired per file, not per stem: a stem's `.jpg` and `.png` can be two different faces (Kang's Arrival `11007a`). A scan is only
    compared at the turn that stands it like the English face, and only counts within `LOCALE_MAX_DISTANCE`.

    The same letter wins unless another scan's art is `LOCALE_MARGIN` closer: two faces with the same picture (a

    catches a scheme the source letters the other way round (Core's `01097`/`01097b`). It is not one-to-one: some
    English folders hold one face under two letters (Attack on Mount Athena, `04061`/`04061b`), and both get the scan.

    A card with one English picture and one translated picture has nothing to mix up, so the letter alone pairs it, within the
