// Which unit tests a set of changed files can affect. Shared by CI (scripts/ci-test-plan.mjs) and the local
// `pnpm test:affected` (scripts/test-affected.mjs), so both skip by the same rule.
//
// The rule follows the import direction, which only points one way (checked 2026-10-09):
//   - packages: client → cards → engine → content. A change to a package can break it and the packages above it.
//   - waves of the cards package: a wave's scripts import only from earlier waves. A change inside wave folders can
//     break those waves and later ones, so the earlier waves are skipped. Anything else in the cards package (core,
//     campaigns, the DSL, the test harness) runs every wave.
//   - the sync Worker (packages/sync-worker) stands outside that chain, but the client imports its wire protocol, so
//     a change there runs its own tests and the client's.
//   - a changelog fragment affects nothing; any other file outside `packages/` (the lockfile, a config, docs or art
//     a test may read) runs everything.
